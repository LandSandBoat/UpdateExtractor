6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7310 : Here at the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition, we entrust various tasks related to [the colonization effort/the protection of Adoulin/the transport of goods through Adoulin and Ulbuka/the collection of information for the benefit of the coalition/the pursuit of new technologies/the provision of new entertainment forms] to those willing to aid our cause.
7311 : %, is it not? Brenton at the Pioneers' Coalition has been looking for you. Please go see him at your earliest convenience.
7312 : %, correct? Brenton here would like to have a word with you. He said it was important.
7313 : [Welcome back./I'm glad to see you again./We've been waiting for you./Back and better than ever, I see./How are things?/Why, hello there!] It is my understanding that you have completed one of our tasks. Do you have anything to report?
7314 : Let me take a look... Why, this % is broken! I'll give you another one, but you really must be more careful with something so valuable.
7315 : Let me take a look... This % is broken. Unfortunately, it's of no use to us now. Go back to the frontier station and bring back another one--whole, this time!
7316 : I wish you speed upon your journey.
7317 : You're not a registered pioneer? I am only authorized to give tasks to those with the appropriate credentials.
7318 : Come back when you have the requisite certification.
7319 : Since you're already here, why not take a few minutes to fill out the forms? It won't take long.
7320 : Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment? Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.
7321 : The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.
7322 : We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.
7323 : Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.
7324 : This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.
7325 : Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.
7326 : However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.
7327 : You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to # of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.
7328 : In your case, we will render you with a total of # imprimaturs every # hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.
7329 : One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.
7330 : Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.
7331 : The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.
7332 : You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.
7333 : There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: coalition referendums.
7334 : The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.
7335 : When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.
7336 : A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.
7337 : The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.
7338 : I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.
7339 : Since this is your first time here, I shall provide you with a total of # imprimaturs so that you may get started right away.
7340 : What would you like to do? (# imprimatur[/s]) Undertake a coalition assignment. Report on a completed assignment. Cancel an in-progress assignment. Check imprimatur distribution time. Hear an explanation of the system. End the conversation.
7341 : What's this, then? You don't have any imprimaturs? Hmm... You needn't be overly worried, for the next batch will be distributed in # [second/minute][/s].
7342 : Select which assignment to cancel.
7343 : Really cancel? Yes. No.
7344 : I have filled out this form stating your cancellation, and restored your imprimaturs to their original amount.
7345 : This makes for a total of # imprimatur[/s] currently in your possession.
7346 : The next batch of imprimaturs will be distributed in # [second/minute][/s].
7347 : You seem to be in possession of the maximum number of imprimaturs. If you do not use them before the next distribution, you will not receive any additional ones.
7348 : We look forward to seeing you again.
7349 : We are currently able to offer you the following coalition assignments.
7350 : Unfortunately, we do not currently have any assignments for you to undertake.
7351 : Select how many imprimaturs you would like to expend for this assignment.
7352 : How many will you use? (Total: #). One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Hang on one moment.
7353 : Use # imprimatur[/s]? Of course! No way.
7354 : You used # imprimatur[/s], and currently have a stock of #.
7355 : Return here once you have completed your assignment. We appreciate your assistance and hope for your safe return.
7356 : Your report was quite valuable. Thank you. We ask that you submit your vote in the coalition referendum before receiving your reward.
7357 : Select which item the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition should prioritize in its expansion plan.
7358 : Truly abstain from voting? Yes. Voting is institutionalized coercion. No. Democracy is a privilege.
7359 : It's a shame you feel that way. Still, you deserve proper compensation. Here you go.
7360 : Would you like to vote this way? Yes. It's my Goddess-given duty. No. My vote doesn't count anyway.
7361 : [Really? That?/Are you sure?/I can't believe.../Hmm.../That's not the way I would have taken it...] Well, I suppose that's why it's your vote, and not mine. What's important is that you expressed your opinion. And now, your compensation.
7362 : I congratulate you on your success and am pleased to hear your report. The coalition has prepared a reward befitting your contributions.
7363 : In addition to the standard compensation, I also hereby present you with this %. A little bird dropped it off, and I feel that it would be best in your capable hands.

7415 : We also give additional rewards based on the degree of construction or the durability of the facility to those pioneers brave enough to travel far distances or into particularly dangerous territory.
7416 : We also give additional rewards based on the extent of the survey to those pioneers brave enough to travel far distances or into particularly dangerous territory.
7417 : [Why, hello there, my dear pioneer!/Good day to you./Hello, pioneer./Welcome to our establishmentaru!/I hope you're having a marvelous-warvelous day!/Welcome back!] Is there anything you'd like to know about the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition?
7418 : What would you like to know about? The [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition's role. The state of the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition. Types of coalition assignments. Current expansion plans. Coalition referendum support. Your current standing. Nothing.
7419 : The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.
7420 : It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.
7421 : The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.
7422 : The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.
7423 : We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.
7424 : The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.
7425 : The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.
7426 : We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.
7427 : Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.
7428 : The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.
7429 : The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.
7430 : Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.
7431 : The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.
7432 : We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.
7433 : Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.
7434 : The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.
7435 : It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.
7436 : Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.
7437 : The [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition is currently rank number #.
7438 : According to the most recent surveys, this coalition [is a blight on the city./is nothing to write home about./isn't half bad./is expanding nicely./is a credit to the city./puts others to shame!/is a paragon of prosperity!] [You might want to try to remedy that./Keep trying./Your efforts are starting to pay off./That said, you're still only halfway to the top./Feel free to gloat about your accomplishments./I hope you're not afraid of heights, because you're incredibly close to the top!/How's the view from the top? Great? Then keep up the excellent work!]
7439 : You've all been [abysmal/uninspiring/decent/remarkable/positively miraculous] at accomplishing your coalition assignments. Our coalition's rank [will almost certainly fall/may fall/will probably stay about the same/might rise/will almost certainly rise] after the next evaluation.

7454 : What assignments will you ask about? Procuring resources. Clearing the way. Preserving the peace. Patrols. Base provisions. Delivering supplies. Frontline support. Land surveys. Component analysis. Gathering materials. Recovering lost articles. Behavioral research. Morale boosting. Nothing.
7455 : Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.
7456 : It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.
7457 : Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.
7458 : The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.
7459 : Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.
7460 : If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.
7461 : While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.
7462 : Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.
7463 : For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet, from some wily veterans.
7464 : Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.
7465 : You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.
7466 : By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.
7467 : The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.
7468 : Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.
7469 : Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.
7470 : The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.
7471 : Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.
7472 : The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.
7473 : The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.
7474 : While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.
7475 : Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.
7476 : This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.
7477 : Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.
7478 : The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!
7479 : The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.
7480 : Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.
7481 : This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.
7482 : Which plan do you want to learn about? Coalition flag. Signboard. Emblem. Second floor. Adoulinian flag. Main terrace. Bay roof. Main chimney. None.
7483 : If the [/coalition flag/signboard/emblem/second floor/Adoulinian flag/main terrace/bay roof/main chimney] expansion plan succeeds, the staff in charge of [Gathering Goods/Gathering Goods II/Gathering Equipment/Gathering Technique Knowledge/Colonization Support Provisions/Gathering Goods III/Gathering Equipment II/Colonization Support Provisions II/Gathering Technique Knowledge II] will [increase in number/expand throughout the continent/provide additional services/be more successful].

7511 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
7512 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
7513 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
7514 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
7515 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
7516 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
7517 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
7518 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
7519 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
7520 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
7521 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
7522 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
7523 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
7524 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
7525 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
7526 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
7527 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
7528 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
7529 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
7530 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!
7531 : It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!
7532 : You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!
7533 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
7534 : Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
7535 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
7536 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
7537 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
7538 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
7539 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
7540 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
7541 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
7542 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
7543 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
7544 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
7545 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
7546 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
7547 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
7548 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
7549 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
7550 : It's all yours, kupo!
7551 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!
7552 : Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
7553 : I found this item in the back of one of the %'s drawers, kupo!
7554 : It's all yours, kupo!
7555 : I found this in the back of the %, kupo!
7556 : It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo! Here, take it, kupo!
7557 : I found this item inside the %, kupo!
7558 : Luck is on your side, kupo! Take it, kupo!
7559 : I fished this item out of the %, kupo!
7560 : It was very hard work, kupo... I'm very tired, kupo...
7561 : I found this behind the % painting, kupo!
7562 : This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
7563 : Something clattered inside the % when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
7564 : It's all yours, kupo!
7565 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
7566 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
7567 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
7568 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
7569 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
7570 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
7571 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
7572 : Each item of furniture you place using the Layout command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
7573 : When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!

7576 : mes8
7577 : mes9
7578 : TEST-No.#
7579 : I found % inside the %, kupo!
7580 : Kupo...? I sense that this % is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!
7581 : Master! Master! Look what I found underneath the % this morning, kupo!
7582 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
7583 : Look what I found in your %!
7584 : You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it. I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!
7585 : Your Mog Locker lease is valid until #/#/# #:#:#, kupo.
7586 : The lease on your Mog Locker has expired, kupo. Please trade % to me or to Fubruhn in Aht Urhgan Whitegate.
7587 : Your Mog Locker lease has been extended until #/#/# #:#:#, kupo!
7588 : Master, Master! I found this in the %, kupo!
7589 : It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
7590 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
7591 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
7592 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
7593 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
7594 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
7595 : Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
7596 : Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
7597 : We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
7598 : Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
7599 : Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your %, when this % just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
7600 : Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
7601 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
7602 : Look at what I found while cleaning out the %: %!
7603 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
7605 : It all began with a raindrop,      or so the legend says...
7606 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
7607 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
7608 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
7609 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
7610 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
7611 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
7612 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
7613 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
7614 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
7615 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
7616 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
7617 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
7618 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
7619 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
7620 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
7621 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...
7622 : Do something? Read instructions. Change parameters. Teleport to key locations. Warp to home point. Receive items. Obtain 100,000,000 gil. Do nothing.
7623 : Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
7624 : But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!
7625 : Furthermore, you may trade a moogle storage slip to me to wipe it clean, or mystically entrust its entire contents to me. Quite convenient, wouldn't you say?

7665 : Hang on! I have an amazing announcement!
7666 : The hallowed halls of your house are even more exciting! Why? Because now there's a second floor, kupo!
7667 : But before you bash your way in, I've got a trifling task for you to tackle.
7668 : Capricious Mithra cubs have cajoled critical information out of the M.H.M.U., and I want you to wrest it from them!
7669 : Visit the three nations and question them, kupo!
7670 : Now you know the nitty-gritty, so enjoy your new floor, kupo!
7671 : Kupopo? You mean you already know?
7672 : Magnificent and marvelous! Then proceed without delay!
7673 : Enjoy extra space to store your sundries!
7674 : Remodel your room to fit your finicky tastes!
7675 : Incorporate ostentatious overseas objects! All this and more!
7676 : But only on the second floor, kupo. I like the first floor as it is.
7677 : And as for your potted plants--they only persevere on the ground, kupo.
7678 : And moghancement effects only activate for furnishings fitted to the first floor.
7679 : Wish we could help more, but we spend enormous amounts of energy on one floor already!
7680 : Go forth and frolic in your new abode, kupo!
7681 : You can access the antechambers from the front door. Enjoy!
7682 : % might bring a certain je ne sais quoi to your Mog House, kupo!
7683 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
7684 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
7685 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
7686 : Oh, what a cruel, cruel master, kupo!!!
7687 : Thank you, kupo! I...have one more favor to ask. It's almost time for the festival in the moogles' hometown, kupo!
7688 : Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him % as a gift, kupo!
7689 : Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and % would make the perfect present, kupo!
7690 : But I have no idea how to go about finding % or %, kupo... I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...

7696 : Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
7697 : Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!
7698 : Looking at that shabby old bed makes me feel homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
7699 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
7700 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
7701 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
7702 : Thank you, kupo! I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!
7703 : Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
7704 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!
7705 : But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
7706 : Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
7707 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!

7714 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
7715 : After resting on the %, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?
7716 : Give your moogle some time off? Have fun, kupo! No, I am your only friend now!
7717 : Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!
7718 : The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take % for my friends there, kupo!
7719 : And my other buddies need % for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!
7720 : I can't help out my friends if I don't have % and %, kupo...
7721 : I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!
7722 : Master! I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!
7723 : We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!
7724 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
7725 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
7726 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
7727 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
7728 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
7729 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
7730 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
7731 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
7732 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
7733 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
7734 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
7735 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
7736 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
7737 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
7738 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
7739 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
7740 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
7741 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
7742 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
7743 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
7744 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
7745 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
7746 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?

7833 : Thanks for coming all this way. I'd love to offer you some hospitality, but we'd need to get this frontier station completed first! Could you lend us a hand by signing up for a coalition assignment?
7834 : Thanks so much for delivering this %! I can't wait to see how this station looks once it's built. If you want, you can go pick up your reward from the manager who gave you this assignment.
7835 : We're glad you tried your best, but destroyed % are useless to us. Sorry, but can you pick up another one from the manager in charge?
7836 : Welcome to the frontier! This station has already been built, but you can always help construct some bivouacs or keep them supplied.
7837 : Frontier stations are self-sufficient, but the bivouacs are sadly not. We'd be extremely appreciative if you could undertake some assignments to make sure they stay in operation.
7838 : Hello, there! We have some materials we'd like delivered to town, but we have to go through the right channels. Would you mind undertaking a coalition assignment to transport them back?
7839 : Thank you for helping us out. Here's the %. All we ask is that you take it to the manager in charge of this assignment.
7840 : Thank you for helping us out. All we ask is that you deliver your cargo safely to the manager in charge of this assignment.
7841 : Well, here's another %, but please be careful not to break this one.
7842 : Good day to you. This is [the future site of /]frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5].
7843 : Thank you for the %. We greatly appreciate your efforts to [help set up/provision] frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5]. Please speak with the manager in charge of this assignment to collect your reward.
7844 : I'm terribly sorry, but we can't use broken %. Could you please return to the coalition assignment desk and procure us another?
7845 : How nice it is to see another face out here! As much as I'd like for you to help us set up frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5], we won't be able to do anything until we've established a base of operations with a frontier station.
7846 : The magical properties of the waypoint proved too much for your % to handle, and it broke...
7847 : This seems to be the site of the ergon locus oft called the [/Flourishing Island/Bud of the Swarm/Luminous Isle/Immutable Boulder/Immaculate Sands/Fruit of Fecundity/Dragon Driftwood/Torchbloom/Spring of Prosperity/Snowdrift Arbor/Frostbloom/Prominence of the Gales/Lake of Light/Sweltering Spring/Prominence of the Flame].

7858 : It's so tough constructing frontier stations. It's always build, build, build, and scrounge, scrounge, scrounge. All I want is a little break from the monotony of it all.
7859 : It's so tough maintaining a frontier station. I'm always fending off bloodthirsty hellions and scrounging for provisions. All I want is a little break from the monotony of it all.
7860 : What will you do? Look pleased. Cry a river. Act surprised. Rue your life. Cheer. Pretend to be flustered. Blush like a maiden. Rally the troops. Nothing for now.
7861 : Ahahaha! Of all the things to pull, I never thought you'd do that! I had no idea that was coming.
7862 : Um...is something the matter with you? Maybe you should see a physician...
7863 : Approaching from that direction [might not have been very effective/was probably the right thing to do.]. As for your gag, [it wasn't with the times/it was right on the mark].
7864 : You don't know how much I needed something like that. Thank you.
7865 : [Construction on /]Frontier Bivouac #[1/2/3/4/5] is[/ currently at] # percent [complete/durability]. We are in need of [materials with which to set up camp/provisions], so would it be possible for you to undertake a coalition assignment and assist us in [building this thing/keeping this place running]?
7866 : Hey, aren't you one of those pioneers from Jeuno? How's Adoulin treating you?
7867 : There's so much to do here in Eastern Adoulin, I bet you don't know where to start!
7868 : Hey, that gives me an idea! Why don't you go and make the rounds for me? That way, you get to see the sights and I get to...stay here!
7869 : I've got a list of where you need to go... ...Wait, where'd I put...? Aha! There it is!
7870 : Here you go. Just follow this route and check for anything out of the ordinary.
7871 : We're the perfect duo, you and me! Just think of how much I...<cough> the citizens appreciate your help!
7872 : Don't go getting lost along the way and having the Twelve Orders step on your toes, okay?
7873 : Not another pioneer come to bother me...
7874 : You're making the rounds!? Don't tell me that lazy good-for-nothing pawned his job off on you!
7875 : <Sigh> You made your own bed, now lie in it. For what it's worth, nothing out of the ordinary here.
7876 : Don't go making any trouble for us, or we'll have to turn our swords on you.
7877 : Hey, whippersnapper, you preparin' for your trip to the Yahse Hunting Grounds?
7878 : Not today? I can barely hear you! Oh ho, so you're checking things out here in Eastern Adoulin!
7879 : Everythin' here's shipshape! Hohoho! Let me know if you ever want to head to Yahse!
7880 : Did something happen? What brings you here?
7881 : Making the rounds? That idiot must've sent you, then.
7882 : As you can see, everything here is the picture of peace itself. When you've got someone as competent as me, there's no way anything could go wrong.
7883 : This is where people in Eastern Adoulin come to relax. If it's not safe here, it's not safe anywhere!
7884 : The citizenry offers prayers to Altana and enjoys cups of tea while gazing over the plaza. It's quite a lovely area.
7885 : On clear mornings, you can see the newborn sun rising over Castle Adoulin.
7886 : Sometimes residents wake up early just to witness the spectacle.
7887 : Forgive my ramblings. You have a mission to complete, don't you?
7888 : I suppose you have business with Ikhi Askamot, ministerrr of education?
7889 : Making the rrrounds tooth and claw, are you?
7890 : There's been no suspicious activity in this parrrt of town.
7891 : Hmm? The minister?
7892 : I'm afrrraid she's not in at the moment. One of the other ministers has their paws on her.
7893 : Easterrrn Adoulin is always busy with the ministers coming and going from their residences. You'd be hard-pressed to catch one of them in their homes.
7894 : Guarding a minister's mansion may not be very glorrrious, but we take pride in it nonetheless!
7895 : Beforrre you lies Castle Adoulin.
7896 : Those not here on official business must...oh, you're here making the rrrounds?
7897 : The castle is completely securrre, thanks in no small part to us guards.
7898 : Let the Peacekeeperrrs know that nothing is amiss here.
7899 : Up ahead you can find the docks that lead pioneers like yourself to the residential areas on the outlying islands.
7900 : Oh, you are here on patrol? Thank you for checking in. I have nothing out of the ordinary to report.
7901 : Our vessels are running on time, and there have been no maritime accidents of late.
7902 : The boat leading to the residential area is just beyond this arch and down the stairs.
7903 : Hello, and welcome to the Scouts' Coalition, where we prrrovide you with the latest information!
7904 : Oh ho? Patrrrols? Everything is in tip-top condition here!
7905 : Our surveys of ergon loci and inspection of rrrare goods from Ulbuka are experiencing nothing but smooth sailing!
7906 : The Celennia Wexworth Memorial Library, under the purrrvey of our coalition, is also running without a hitch.
7907 : Taking some time to snuggle up with a good book is a grrreat way to spend the evening, don't you think?
7908 : Hey, pal!
7909 : How was it? Eastern Adoulin sure has a lot to offer, don't you think?
7910 : Much of the nobility lives in this area. So many movers and shakers that sometimes I just stop in awe...of the injustice!
7911 : In part because of this, patrols here are a lot more tiring than in Western Adoulin.
7912 : But the West directly borders the jungle, so I think it's high time they stop paying so much attention to those bayld bursars and tighten things up over there instead!
7913 : Don't you think?
7914 : On my days off I sometimes go around and make sure things are ok, sometimes with the young lads who live in the area.
7915 : To be frank, while you were going around here in the East I went down to the West to...you know, check things out.
7916 : Seeing all those kids working hard for Adoulin makes me realize that I can't slack off either!
7917 : Hey pal--aren't you a pioneer from Jeuno? Haha, I knew you were from the Middle Lands! Me? I'm a trader from Bastok.
7918 : I'd been enjoying the high life at this restaurant with all the gil I've made here so far.
7919 : Sooo...that's when I decided to try to rent an airship to make my grand return to Bastok!
7920 : Because I realized--did I really want to spend all that time in some boat cooped up against piles and piles of cargo crates?
7921 : I mean, pioneers like you didn't use conventional means to come here, right? You have those waypoint things to rely on.
7922 : Good on you. Me, I can't trust that type of new technology! What if I find myself stranded on some desert island because the machine was malfunctioning!? Yeah, no fun. So I sold my geomagnetron.
7923 : <Sigh> But now, when I think of the long days and nights I'll have to spend to get back...
7924 : I'm getting seasick just thinking about it.
7925 : That being the case, I've decided to realize my dream of going back on an airship.
7926 : Adoulin uses airships, too, but only for shipping purposes. I've heard that they have no passenger services whatsoever.
7927 : I kept pressing the lady at the desk for an answer, but she glared at me like I'd just eaten her firstborn child.
7928 : And that's where you come in. I want you to head over to the airship docks located on the north side of Western Adoulin and find out why they won't let me use their airships for travel.
7929 : Go check with the lady at the desk. She'll probably tell you why they don't provide airship travel services.
7930 : My friend, you're back! Did you find anything out?
7931 : Oh...so it has to do with propeller malfunctioning.
7932 : Do you suppose they'll reconsider if a safer way is found? Or are they using this as an excuse?
7933 : I suppose it doesn't matter. I'll stay here in Adoulin for a little while longer. Thanks for checking it out for me, though!
7934 : You must be one of those pioneers I keep hearing about.
7935 : You heard of the Rala Waterways, located beneath the areas surrounding the castle?
7936 : It's like a goddamn maze down there. Good luck finding a reliable way in.
7937 : There are gates located throughout, but which ones are open changes depending on the day.
7938 : Don't think you can learn one way in and be set for life. It's not that easy.
7939 : I want you to check the gates' operations and help keep the area safe.
7940 : Go speak to the soldier located near the holy battlegrounds, an area of the Waterways located beneath locales leading to Big Bridge.
7941 : If you can do this simple task, then I'll recognize you as a [man/woman] of mettle.
7942 : Forgot how to get there already? You're looking for a soldier located in the holy battlegrounds area of the Waterways, located in areas beneath Big Bridge.
7943 : How are you progressing?
7944 : Everything checks out, then?
7945 : If you managed to get that far, then you've succeeded in navigating that area without getting lost. Good work.
7946 : With all the foul creatures sprouting like weeds down there, we've had trouble ensuring the gates are functioning properly of late.
7947 : Any help you can give in keeping the area safe would be most welcome.
7948 : I'll share a secret with you. The Waterways also serve as an emergency exit of sorts.
7949 : I find it quite helpful that more pioneers are beginning to learn about the area. If anything happens, the lot of you can assist us in case of evacuation.
7950 : There can never be too many people willing to lend us a hand.
7951 : Leave your pride at the door and strive to be the best pioneer you can. Adoulin is counting on you.
7952 : That's all for today.
7953 : This slope sure is steep!
7954 : I asked grandpa why they made it. He said it was to protect the castle.
7955 : He also said that some guy used to spend time running up and down.
7956 : He ran so much they named it after him! I forgot what grandpa said his name was.
7957 : Want me to run up this slope to show you how big it is? Here I go!
7958 : <Huff> <puff> I...can...barely...breathe...!
7959 : There's no way I can make a second go at it! Mom was right when she said kids shouldn't play on it!
7960 : Whose idea was it to make this stupid thing, anyway!? Not like I'll ever go to the castle, but still!

7970 : Display interest? Well, seeing that enthusiasm... Pfft. No.

7976 : Huh? Where am...? Oh, sorry. There are so many of these things all over Eastern Adoulin that sometimes I lose my bearing-wearings.
7977 : Record all the data in each area...I'm sure it will help you. Yes, somehow.
7978 : Here...start with this one right nextaru to us. Ohhh...my head. How many of you do I have to explain this to?
7979 : Now you have recorded the data-wata in this waypoint. Congratulations on your <yawn> momentous accomplishment.
7980 : Oh...you've already recorded the data here. Nice work. Bet that took a lot of effort. <Snort>
7981 : A small amount of kinetic units will let you use waypoints as much as you want...but only if you've recorded the data from them first. Phew, is it really hotaru out here, or is it me?
7982 : So get out there and start recording! No, seriously, leave.
7983 : You want to...know where the others are? I swear, some adventurers want everything handed to them on a silver plattaru.
7984 : One is straight to the east of here, in the plaza where the statue-watue of Altana stands. You do know who Altana is, right? Or do I need to give a theology lesson, too?
7985 : One is rightaru to the south, in front of the Scouts' Coalition. Why don't you go ask them for information, instead of standing here bothering me?
7986 : One is to the north near the wharf that leady-weads to the Yahse Hunting Grounds. That's right, the wharf. You know, where the boatarus dock?
7987 : One is a bit to the south, deep within the alleyways, where your Rent-a-Room is. Yes, that place you go tumbling-wumbling back to at night after protecting us from villainous creatarus.
7988 : From the southwestern part of the plaza head south and then east, in frontaru of the auction house. You know what I wish they sold at the auction house? Better jobs.
7989 : East from the plaza, on Sverdhried Hillock, which leads to Adoulin Castle. A hillock is a big slopey-wope. It would be a shame if you were to, say...sprain your ankle on the way up.
7990 : And one up past the hillock...at the entrance-wentrance to Coronal Esplanade. Did you realize that esplanade is just a fancy-wancy name for walkway?
7991 : And more...one beyond there, in front of the gate to Adoulin Castle. Castle. You know, big thing? Nobility lives there, etc., etc.?
7992 : Far be it from a simple laytaru like me to dictate the rules of engagementaru, but start from the top and work your way down. It'll be easier.
7993 : You've recorded all the data...congratulations. This will surely go down in the annals of history-wistory.
7994 : Maybe I shouldn't be so harshy-warsh. Here's your reward. Take it before I change my mind.
7995 : How are you finding the waypointarus? You'd better not have made me go through all that explanation for nothing!
7996 : [Mr./Ms.] pioneer, [sir/ma'am]! I need your helpy-welp!
7997 : Meg...Meg is sick.
7998 : But...I have to sit here like some window dressing and assistaru all you pioneers, so I can't go check up on her.
7999 : It pains me to ask for your aid, but could you use this % and take a looky-wook at her for me?
8000 : I'm so worried about them all...even Emily, Pinono, and Josephine in Western Adoulin... Waypointarus are such gentle beasts. Not always demanding directions and being cavalier in pursuit of ever increasing riches, unlike a certain adventaru I could name.
8001 : Use the % to scrutinize-wutinize them for me. You owe me that much.
8002 : Oh...and don't go about calling her by her firstaru name. I'm the only one allowed to do that.
8003 : She's the one in frontaru of the auction house in Western Adoulin.
8004 : Wow, you actually did it? Hmph. First adventurer in a while who's worth [his/her] saltaru.
8005 : <Grumble> Guess that means I gotta give you something-womething, doesn't it?
8006 : Here. Just don't tell anyone I gave it to you, or they'll all come running to assistaru me and bleed me dry.
8007 : Yes, yes, you checked Meg out, but there are other waypointarus who also need your help!
8008 : Hm? Whaddya want? Oh, you're the one who helped my boy. Getting rid of those monsters was a big help.
8009 : He's always been such a worrywart, but I'll tell you--when he told me his most recent stories, the hair on the back of my neck started to stand up. Mind if I get this off my chest?
8010 : Listen to his story? I've got my listening ears on. No, thank you.
8011 : Well, if you ever have a free moment, I'm always willing to share.
8012 : Just past here are the Yahse Hunting Grounds. Since you're not from around here, you might not've heard the tales told about the Velkk there.
8013 : Ferocious savages, I tell you. Doesn't matter who you are or how big of a weapon you've got. If you come near them, you'll be met with nothing but violence.
8014 : But a pioneer like you--you could match them ponz for ponz. Can you head to Yahse and get me % or %?
8015 : That'll show me you gave those savages a good beating and help me sleep better at night.
8016 : Head to Yahse, kill as many of those nasty Velkk as you can, and collect % or % to put my mind at ease.
8017 : Hey there. Managed to kill a bunch of filthy Velkk scum, did you? I'd expect no less of a pioneer.
8018 : I'll be able to breathe a bit easier now. Here--a token of my appreciation.
8019 : Hey! My favorite pioneer! My pal, my friend, my buddy! You know what best buds do? They kill more Velkk to make their friends feel safer!
8020 : Not that I'm, um <gulp> scared. Just, you know--can never be too careful. Why don't you go knock some skulls and bring me back some more % or % from the Velkk?
8021 : Just talk to that guy at the counter to head back to the Yahse Hunting Grounds.
8022 : Excuse me. A moment of your time, [good sir/kind lady]?
8023 : Spare a moment? No time like the present. Beat a timely retreat.
8024 : Come on, it'll just take a minute!
8025 : Times are rough for my family. My son keeps going on about some enveloping darkness and my husband is scared to death of monsters in the Yahse Hunting Grounds.
8026 : Now all their worrying has gotten to me! My once-pristine forehead is covered in wrinkles from furrowing my brow!
8027 : The Yahse Hunting Grounds are barely a stone's throw away. People talk about shadowy fiends down there, and I'm stricken with fear!
8028 : Will the Peacekeepers' Coalition be able to keep us safe? Sometimes I wonder.
8029 : So that's why I was hoping to find a [strapping/strong] pioneer like yourself to help me out with this problem.
8030 : Take the law into your own hands. Defeat some of those nasties down in the Yahse Hunting Grounds and bring me %.
8031 : If the rumors about your type are true, then it should be easy!
8032 : I'm so glad you were able to make good on your promise when so many before you did not.
8033 : I can sleep well at night knowing my home is a bit safer. Here--this is for you.
8034 : Why, hello again! You know, my hubby is still telling those wild stories of his, and his fear is starting to rub off on me all over again.
8035 : Can you head down to Yahse Hunting Grounds again and bring me some %? I'll make if worth your while, just like before.
8036 : My poor son and husband. I hope everything will be all right...
8037 : Welcome to our humble caf. I...have to apologize for bringing this matter before a customer, but do you have time to hear my story?
8038 : Listen to her story? Yes. I've got enough on my plate.
8039 : Of course. I understand. May I take your order, [sir/ma'am]?
8040 : Really? Well... We're having trouble getting supplies in from the Couriers' Coalition.
8041 : To be frank, I used to work for them, but...with all their resources being poured into pioneering, they can't spare much--even with my connections.
8042 : During my time there, I had the opportunity to travel all throughout the world, you know? New places, new foods, new ingredients and recipes...and that's when I chose to open this candy shop.
8043 : Recently, though, I can't get ahold of any %.
8044 : So that's why I'd like to ask you to gather # % for me.
8045 : I mean, of course % work in a pinch, but I can't get that exotic flavor without %.
8046 : I'll make it worth your time, I swear!
8047 : Come back soon, my pioneer friend!
8048 : Oh, how lovely! You got some for me! Now I'll be able to make those % I've been wanting to!
8049 : If I run out, I can count on you to go get me some more, right?
8050 : Welcome back! I bet you can guess what I'm going to ask you...
8051 : Help out the poor soul? I suppose. Not again...
8052 : It's pretty much the same as before. Bring me # %.
8053 : Remember, I won't have enough until you bring me # %.
8054 : Welcome to the Caf des Larmes! Please, pull up a seat and make yourself comfortable.
8055 : What a pickle-wickle.
8056 : You! Yes, %, you! I feel the bile-wile rising in my throataru at the thought of this, but...I need your help.
8057 : Remember those waypointarus you helped me with before? Well, they're fine, but now it's the ones outside the city that are giving me trouble-wouble.
8058 : My precious little ones, always doing what's rightaru for the populace. Unlike some people.
8059 : I need you to look after the ones in Jeuno and the frontier-wontier stations. And how dare you patronize me for caring about my babies! They've helped more people than you have, and that's a factaru.
8060 : Poor little Chapi, floating out there all alone in a foreign land...
8061 : The energies in the Middle Lands are weaker than those here, though someone lacking in astutaruness like yourself probably can't tell. That makes it hard to fix them.
8062 : My sweet proto-wotos are designed specifically for your backwards homeland, so they should be fine, at least.
8063 : But Chapi is super special. She needs to connect you people with Adoulin, and so requires some unique equipmentaru.
8064 : Thus the Inventors' Coalition came up with a new adjustmentaru for our always-reliable %.
8065 : Thus, I need you to go back and check up on Chapi. I would apologize for the trouble, but there's no need to concerny-wern myself with such details.
8066 : I'm suffering heataru stroke waiting here for you. What took so long?
8067 : I should be thankful-wankful that you did what you were asked--but I'm not. At least Chapi should be fine for the time being.
8068 : What's this? You want a reward for your effortarus? <Huff> Fine. Just don't expectaru anything else if I need you again!
8069 : <Sigh> Now what do I do?
8070 : Oh ho! Hello, stranger. Care to lend a hand?
8071 : I've heard about those like you and the good work you do opening up the land.
8072 : I've tried my hand at it myself, but I can't get the hang of it no matter what I do!
8073 : Is there some trick that I'm missing? Some way to make good progress? Please, let me know if you have any wisdom to share!
8074 : Do you have time to explain? Sure. Poor guy needs some help. Why would I help the competition?
8075 : I had hoped you would lend me a hand, but...I guess I understand.
8076 : I'll be right here if you ever change your mind.
8077 : Have you come back to tell me more about pioneering?
8078 : Really? You're a lifesaver!
8079 : Okay, let's start with the Pioneers' Coalition.
8080 : Any tips for [Colonization Reives/supply shipping/material procurement/ergon locus surveys/Lair Reives/morale boosting]? [Assist other pioneers/Do not engage in battle while delivering/Gather things yourself/Find a good angle of approach/Attack from the back/Check what the target wants]. [Attack from specific locations/Using waypoints is acceptable/Buy from the auction house or pioneers/Swiftly destroy ergon loci/Don't forget gathering tools/Stay as far away as possible]. [Lure enemies away from the area/Walk slowly to avoid dropping/It's acceptable to deliver similar items/Acquire results from someone else/Assist other pioneers/Fight enemies together].
8081 : Hang on, let me take some notes.
8082 : Next, could you help me with the [n/Couriers'/Inventors'/Scouts'/Peacekeepers'/n] Coalition?
8083 : And last, but not least, the Mummers' Coalition.
8084 : Wow, that's a lot to take in! But I'm sure what you've told me will come in handy.
8085 : Next time we meet, I'll let you know how things are going.
8086 : Are you satisfied with your responses? Definitely. Let me reconsider.
8087 : Time to turn my past failures into future successes!
8088 : I don't think I can possibly thank you enough!
8089 : I did it!!! Now I'm finally a full-fledged pioneer!
8090 : I don't know what I'd've done if you hadn't come along!
8091 : But a pioneer's work is never done. Time to get back to it!
8092 : Oh...hello again.
8093 : It was a complete and utter disaster. I don't know if I'm cut out for pioneering after all...
8094 : <Sigh>...
8095 : Let me know when you have a free minute. I'd like to go over it all again.
8096 : Well, I tried following your advice from earlier.
8097 : My efforts with the [Pioneers'/Couriers'/Inventors'/Scouts'/Peacekeepers'/Mummers'] Coalition were a [success/failure].
8098 : I worked up the courage to ask another guy doing the same job for the Pioneers' Coalition to work with me...and it was wonderful!
8099 : I used the waypoints to go get the supplies, but once I had them firmly in hand, I went on foot to deliver them. I broke a bit of a sweat, but it was well worth the extra effort!
8100 : I bought some materials from other pioneers and successfully delivered them. It almost felt like I was cheating!
8101 : My surveys of ergon loci were made all the easier by making sure I was safe beforehand.
8102 : I worked together with the other pioneers there and managed to succeed admirably!
8103 : Even when things seemed grim, I kept at it and figured out just the thing that would perk them up!
8104 : I just wish I was able to succeed in all my tasks, instead of just a couple.
8105 : <Sigh>...
8106 : Informathion on the Owder of Haverton? Gee [mithter/mith], you'll have to go the Scouths' Coalithion for that!
8107 : A-ah, you're here on behalf of the Library? Then perhaps I can be of assistance!
8108 : Wh-what do you mean? All information on Haverton is one hundred percent accurate and up-to-date. The Scouts' Coalition is under our wing, after all!
8109 : A report? From the library? Let me get a look at that.
8110 : Yes, all information on the Order of Vocane is in proper order. Just between us, a simple survey isn't so bad, but try not to go poking around where you don't belong next time.
8111 : Worrrking for the library, are you? Well, let me see what you've got for me.
8112 : ...There's something new about Ikhi Askamot that's not listed in the file. Herrre, let me add it for you. Enjoy.
8113 : The library now has pioneers doing its work for them? How unbecoming. Let me take a look at your documents.
8114 : Yes, this is Hildebert's manor, but Vortimere is the one currently residing here. Let me add this to your materials.
8115 : You came to visitaru us on behalf of the library? Wonderful organization, no doubt.
8116 : Perfectaru information about the Order of Gorney. I have nothing to correct. Remember, we're always interested in new business-wusiness leads. Feel free to come back if you find anything of note!
8117 : You've brought me a survey-wurvey about the Twelve Orders? I thought pioneers were supposed be out colonizing the land, not running menial tasks in Adoulin.
8118 : Everything about Woltaris is correctaru. I suppose that's all you need?
8119 : The master is far too preoccupied to see an outsiderrr like... What's this? The librrrary? Maybe I can be of assistance.
8120 : Those slobs need to update their rrrecords better. So much of this is out of date! There. Now everything is as it should be.
8121 : Tallying conquest results...

8339 : I apologize for the inconvenience, but would you please return during the aforementioned times?
8340 : %...yes, you are indeed on the invite list.
8341 : There should be a servant waiting inside the castle to escort you to the dinner.
8342 : We hope you find the festivities to your liking.
8343 : We've collectaru'd three in just the past month!
8344 : Considering how we hadn't found any % for years, that's an annual increase of infinity-winity percent!
8345 : I'd say the money spent recruitaruing all those pioneers has more than paid for itself.
8346 : As ever, your naivet knows no bounds, Chero-Machero.
8347 : Death awaits all who step beyond Jorius Yett, and I daresay you'd not soon like to lie on a bier, even one made of bayld.
8348 : Nothing good can come of raping the land and violating the will of our ancestors!
8349 : Ha, you've gone so blindy-wind in your old age that you can't even see the forestaru for the trees, Hildebert.
8350 : I think it's time you gave up your seataru to your son, gramps.
8351 : No amount of flimflam and hocus-pocus flung by senile old detractarus can hide the truth. Numbers never lie, my friends, and they're telling us to charge on ahead with the pioneering effort!
8352 : We'll be drowning in profitarus!
8353 : I cannot even begin to fathom the depths of your idiocy...
8354 : You are willing to throw common sense, tradition, and the continent itself away just to line your pockets!?
8355 : Blatantly ignoring our founding king's dying request and indulging in vulgarities... We are sure to lose Altana's blessing should this plan bear its rotten fruit.
8356 : The only thing that's rotten-wotten in this room is your outdated sense of morals, old man!
8357 : Adoulin has to stop being so insular! Don't you get it? We live in a pluralistic world and must look toward the global marketaru!
8358 : Like those brave crusaders of justice-wustice who've worked wonders in the Middle Lands and the Near East. Those...what's their name, again? It's rightaru on the tip of my tongue.
8359 : Ah, yes. Adventarus!
8360 : Thanks to the influx of adventurers, Adoulin's seen drastic-wastic increases in--
8361 : Those barbaric nomads who care not a whit for our bonds with the land!?
8362 : I swear, if I looked up dogmatism in an encyclopedia, your portraitaru would be right at the top, you old geezer!
8363 : I have had it with your childish aspersions! I'll not be called geezer by a money-grubbing midget like you!
8364 : This is neither the time nor the place to be acting out like this. Shame on both of you.
8365 : Just think if the Goddess were to witness two of her own children besmirching each other! Oh, the tears she would shed...
8366 : Urg.
8367 : Hmph.
8368 : Such a troublesome pair, you two...
8369 : Ah, [Monsieur/Madame] %, I presume? Allow me to bid you welcome.
8370 : How is it that I know your name?
8371 : Haha, how coy of you. It's truly elementary, my dear pioneer.
8372 : No, I'm neither prescient nor clairvoyant. Your reputation simply precedes you.
8373 : And it is indeed grand. How could it not be, after having performed such glorious deeds?
8374 : Accounts of how you bested the Naakuals could never remain mere whispers amongst the citizenry.
8375 : That is how astonishing--and perhaps a tad preternatural--your abilities are. The more appropriate question would be, Who has not heard of you?
8376 : No longer need we worry ourselves about the progress of Ulbuka's colonization, for you have shown those nettlesome guardians the true power of pioneers!
8377 : With this accomplishment squarely under your belt, even the sky cannot serve as a limit to you! From here on out, we have high hopes for your further contribution to the colonization effort.
8378 : As an aside, %...
8379 : Did you know that a whole century has passed since the Sacred City of Adoulin was established?
8380 : While that may be an obvious fact, a lesser known piece of trivia is that the population of Adoulin's archipelago has more than doubled in the past decade.
8381 : This growth shows no signs of stagnating, either.
8382 : The obvious outcome of this population explosion is that the demand placed on our food supply--as well as our insufficient housing--increases dramatically.
8383 : The sad fact amongst all of this is that we simply do not possess the technology to increase these islands' landmass.
8384 : There will eventually come a point at which the available land can no longer accommodate its populace.
8385 : I realize the last thing we need is a fearmonger.
8386 : However, I sincerely believe we have already reached the breaking point.
8387 : That is exactly why the colonization effort is indispensable!
8388 : To the west, vast expanses of land stretch well past the horizon!
8389 : But is gaining all that land worth breaking the ancient pact?
8390 : Speak your grievances, my dear Gratzigg. I am nothing if not fair, and there are two sides to every story. Let yours be heard.
8391 : Don't you remember King August's last words? Tread not upon the hinterland of Ulbuka.
8392 : That pact with the spirits has been honored by our people for longer than any of us have been alive!
8393 : To blatantly ignore it would do nothing but invite divine retribution. Isn't that right, Vortimere?
8394 : Th-that may be true, Gratzigg.
8395 : B-but Grand Chancellor Ygnas is Adras's descendant, and it is he who p-p-patrons the colonization movement.
8396 : Do my eyes d-d-deceive me, or has Mr. Adoulin...yet to grace us with his presence?
8397 : Grand Chancellor Ygnas has a bout of illness, so I have been told.
8398 : Oh, my... This...this does not b-b-bode well. Not in the least.
8399 : He convinced us all to disregard the founder's will...and now he is unable to even stand before us and d-d-defend his position...
8400 : How can the mastermind behind this sacrilege worm his way out of all culpability? To hell with this farce!
8401 : Your anger is m-m-more than understandable, Gratzigg...but there is little we can do if the chancellor is ill.
8402 : It is an unfortunate t-t-turn of events, but one we must accept.
8403 : Turn of events, my tail!
8404 : He's probably locked himself away in his ivory tower, sniveling into his pillow and quivering at the grave mistake he's made!
8405 : That's quite the venomous-wenemous statement, Gratzigg.
8406 : So it is, and I stand by every word of it. And you, Chero-Machero!? Your hands are just as sullied!
8407 : Who the hell is this!? %?
8408 : We have employed this [rugged fighter/tenacious beauty] as a pioneer.
8409 : [He/She] also happens to be one of those fabled adventurers so oft sung of in songs from the Middle Lands.
8410 : [His/Her] prowess in exploring has been indispensable to our cause, so [he/she] has been invited to this gathering.
8411 : Hmph, sounds like nothing but a filthy swindler to me.
8412 : And? I guess that means you're here for His Highness, then.
8413 : If you truly want to get rich quick, then you've got to go through his servant first. Try asking him about the chancellor's constitution. I hear Ygnas isn't well enough to attend his own meetings, but suuurely he'll grant an audience to some nomad he's never met before.
8414 : It seems...the g-g-grand chancellor...is feeling...under the weather...
8415 : Damn your idiotic euphemisms! Under the weather!?
8416 : What the hell is that supposed to mean!? Exactly how's he under the weather!?
8417 : I see apothecaries and priests here. Have any of them tended to the chancellor's supposed bout of illness?
8418 : Well...um...errr...
8419 : Arciela V. Adoulin, daughter of the former royal family and sister to Grand Chancellor Ygnas, has entered the hall!
8420 : I'm terribly sorry to have kept you all waiting.
8421 : Again, let me apologize for my tardiness.
8422 : N-no need...Miss Arciela.
8423 : It seems my brother has worked himself sick over the issue of colonization.
8424 : He came down with a fever recently, so he has been confined to his bed until his symptoms subside.
8425 : ...Still, this is an assembly of the utmost importance! Hasn't he heard about the--
8426 : Yes, we are both well aware of what has transpired.
8427 : Therefore, I have told my esteemed brother that if the colonization effort should continue, it should do so with all due caution.
8428 : Erg.
8429 : What? Why!? Think of the richy-wiches, Arciela!
8430 : My, oh my. It seems that Lady Arciela isn't too fond of letting people enter the jungles outside the city.
8431 : Yet she certainly enters them often enough!
8432 : Or that is what an astute detractor might argue, anyway.
8433 : The Twelve Orders of Adoulin were created equal...but some more equal than others. I suppose that is bound to happen when the members of one all have the founder king's blood coursing through their royal veins.
8434 : I'm so glad you decided to become a pioneer, %.
8435 : See, I was right after all.
8436 : We did meet again!
8437 : Oh, heavens, this isn't good. No, no, not good at all!
8438 : Hm?
8439 : You there--I've seen you before. Where was it, at the place? The place with the thing?
8440 : No matter. What was your name again? %? That's right, %. You're one of those pioneers everyone's been raving about.
8441 : Do you have some business here, or...?
8442 : Oh! While I have you here...you wouldn't have happened to see the princess, would you? Arciela, I mean.
8443 : No? Ohhh, that's what I was afraid of. She must have put on her traveling clothes and headed off into the forest...
8444 : She had been muttering something about strange goings-on at an ergon locus in the Cirdas Caverns.
8445 : I-I mean... Oh dear, you're not supposed to know that! I didn't tell you anything, and no one can prove that I did!
8446 : Sweet mercy! This is not a good day for me at all...
8447 : What do you want? My time is too precious to waste with a common whelp.
8448 : Maester Gratzigg, this [man/woman] is an adventurer from the Middle Lands--a pioneer.
8449 : Yes, now that I look closer, I remember your face.
8450 : It is because of fools like yourself that the sacred forests have been violated after centuries of peace!
8451 : Bah. Mincing words with a barbaric outsider is a waste of time. I shall go myself.
8452 : But, Maester!
8453 : And I suppose you have a better idea for remedying this calamity? This is a matter of pride for both orders.
8454 : Don't just stand there--follow me!
8455 : You're a pioneer? Then you must be interested in what this whole mess is about.
8456 : Well, obviously a fight has broken out--in the middle of the city. Surely you're aware of the struggles between those in favor of colonization and those opposed.
8457 : Some young upstart from the Order of Renaye and a lunkhead from the Inventors' Coalition have come to blows.
8458 : And since neither is backing down, the situation is just getting worse.
8459 : The two are strict adherents to their orders, so any fight between them is a fight between the orders themselves.
8460 : I bet you're just itching to stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Hmph. No skin off my back, but Gratzigg has likely put everything to rest already.
8461 : And by put to rest, I mean moved the squabble down to the coliseum.
8462 : Inquire further? Coliseum?
8463 : How can you spend so much time in Adoulin and be completely oblivious to the famed Watergarden Coliseum in Rala Waterways? It's a place where pride is won and lost.
8464 : Since anyone can remember, the place has been used to settle disputes and feuds...sometimes even at the cost of precious lives.
8465 : But it isn't a place for barbarism. Strict rules have been put in place to keep all fights fair.
8466 : That has kept the deaths to the minimum--but that doesn't mean some poeple don't come out with their tails between their legs.
8467 : But there's no point in heading down there. They don't just let any riffraff in to watch the fights.
8468 : The Peacekeepers' Coalition has better things to do than keep an eye on any fool who wants to watch blood be shed.
8469 : So don't think for one second that the guards will let you pass its gates.
8470 : Ugh, can't a guy go one day without someone causing trouble?
8471 : You overheard some scary figures muttering furtively in the Rala Waterways?
8472 : Hmmm... H-G-something-I, you say?
8473 : My guess is that they are the initials of the individuals who lead orders in opposition to the colonization movement.
8474 : So, that would be...wait, don't tell me...
8475 : Hildebert, the minister of judication... Gratzigg, from the Peacekeepers' Coalition... Svenja, the minister of public affairs...
8476 : ...and Ikhi Askamot, the minister of education.
8477 : That actually makes a lot of sense.
8478 : You are more than welcome.
8479 : If you were missing Svenja...
8480 : That means the whole thing is HGSI!
8481 : According to my theory, at least.
8482 : If your theory's wrong, at least we'll know who to blame.
8483 : How about you blame yourself for failing to come up with any of your own ideas?
8484 : Alright, you got me. Let's just get back to work, okay? The mountain of paperwork we've got on our hands isn't going to disappear by itself.
8485 : That is the first good point you have made all day.
8486 : What business have you at this hour?
8487 : ...Ah, I knew I recognized you. You're %, the pioneer invited to the dinner here some time ago.
8488 : Please pardon my temporary lapse in memory. Sadly, I am under strict orders not to let anyone into the castle this late at night.
8489 : What? A plot by anti-colonization revolutionaries, you say?
8490 : I'm afraid that isn't my jurisdiction. You'll have to inform the Peacekeepers' Coalition, as they are much more prepared than I to deal with something of this scope.
8491 : Come to think of it, I remember Grennith mentioning a problem with the kitchen. I hardly think that has anything to do with a conspiracy, though.
8492 : What was it? Oh, just that they had yet to receive their weekly stock of ingredients from the Civic Arboretum.
8493 : %... Why bring someone of such questionable moral character to this assembly?
8494 : The Order of Adoulin remains yet the leader of our alliance, with a strong lineage tracing back to the founder king.
8495 : Why would you summon a mere commoner--and one from a foreign land, at that!?
8496 : You seem to have won over the hearts of the nobility, hmm?
8497 : Take a brief moment to listen away from their eyes.
8498 : Hildebert, there is no reason to work yourself into a tizzy.
8499 : You are well aware that we attempted to use %, which [he/she] received from the queen of the leafkin.
8500 : And in the end, none of us were able to communicate with Ygnas.
8501 : No, % was the only one to do so...
8502 : Hmph. Dear Svenja, you let yourself be taken in by this mockery of our orders. What proof have you that [he/she] wasn't just spouting drivel to serve [his/her] own ends?
8503 : [He/She] certainly did not seem to be lying to me.
8504 : No, % seemed like a young [man/lady] who chooses the path of enlightenment rather than willful ignorance.
8505 : No, % seemed like a young [man/lady] who is not constrained by selfish pride, but rather has the courage to know when to listen.
8506 : No, % seemed like a young [man/lady] of great poise despite [his/her] small stature.
8507 : No, % seemed like a young lady filled with self-control who doesn't give in to flippant desires.
8508 : No, % seemed like a man filled with both the vigor of youth and the wisdom of age.
8509 : Oh ho, my dear Svenja, you seem to have quite the opinion of our enigmatic friend.
8510 : But darkness of the heart oft lies well hid. Are you sure trusting one such as [she/he] is prudent?
8511 : Not to say, of course, that I disbelieve [her/him].
8512 : No, it is through % that we learn about Ygnas's condition, as well as the Middle Lands themselves.
8513 : Their armies, politics, economy... We cannot sit forever on this little island, playing fifth fiddle to the rest of Vana'diel.
8514 : On that, I daresay, you are mistaken.
8515 : Oh? About what?
8516 : I do not wish to speak ill of %, but...
8517 : The situation is not so simple.
8518 : Lest you forget, Arciela was also able to hear Ygnas's voice.
8519 : W-well I--
8520 : And yet she chose to leave % with that which Rosulatia bequeathed.
8521 : Rosulatia gave it to %, not to me.
8522 : Hildebert, Melvien. My trust in % is not mere whimsy.
8523 : If Arciela believes in [him/her], then so shall I.
8524 : Sometimes I stop and catch myself pondering what this all means.
8525 : What if...what if all this were a challenge posed to us by the founder king?
8526 : In the countless years since his passing, how has Adoulin changed and evolved?
8527 : That one of his bloodline should be transformed into a lesser being right as colonization recommenced...we may be struggling against a current stronger than ourselves.
8528 : That is why I wonder if we are being tested.
8529 : Tested? By whom?
8530 : I do not know.
8531 : Perhaps...by fate itself.
8532 : Well, my sarcasm comes back to haunt me. You appear to have some allies within these walls.
8533 : The real trial will come right as we pass through these doors.
8534 : I've heard all I need to. Let us see how useful you really are.
8535 : I have returned from the Middle Lands--and it appears everyone is already assembled.
8536 : Dispense with the pleasantries. Show me to Ygnas.
8537 : Far be it from me to doubt one of my own order...but how much can you tell from such a simple gesture?
8538 : I must confess my surprise at your doubt. I speak only as the Goddess guides me. Tell me, do you doubt Her wisdom?
8539 : Forgive me if my words seem brazen, Hildebert.
8540 : Back to the matter at hand...what has befallen Ygnas is most certainly some form of curse.
8541 : Then it is as we suspected.
8542 : Indeed. And though this is no ordinary curse, I am inclined to believe that it is not borne from the founder king.
8543 : (She's...)
8544 : (...wro...)
8545 : (B...but...I cannot...put...words.)
8546 : (%...)
8547 : (You....talk to...me...now... ...may not...able...longer.)
8548 : Yes, adventurer? Has Ygnas spoken to you?
8549 : You say this is, in fact, the curse of the founder king? And what basis have you for contradicting me?
8550 : S-so it is...after all.
8551 : How your mind changes on every whim, like a leaf upon the breeze. Not five minutes ago you were singing a different tune.
8552 : You were s-spying on us from outside the door!?
8553 : Hmph. I never took you for one who only hears what he wants to.
8554 : That is not the case at all, just...
8555 : What do you say? There's no need to break the curse. Nothing.
8556 : Silence, outsider. You have no place interjecting your opinions into this dialogue. Your only job is to tell us what he is saying.
8557 : It matters not who placed this curse upon Ygnas.
8558 : Only a grand ritual of purging will be able to rid such a terrible affliction, but unfortunately...
8559 : Unfortunately what, Ingrid?
8560 : Such a purgation requires materials that I do not have on hand.
8561 : Vana'diel only exists thanks to the blessings of eight crystals. To penetrate darkness, we need a vessel wrapped in the power of the seven other types.
8562 : I have on hand thunder, ice, and light...and would ask you to procure earth, water, fire, and wind for me.
8563 : And what exactly would suffice?
8564 : They must be things bathed in a holy glow...let me think...
8565 : Yes...a piece of stone wall touched by the light of dawn.
8566 : Holy water untainted by impurity.
8567 : A flame that has gone unextinguished for seven years.
8568 : The wings of a weather vane that has stood the test of time.
8569 : I require each of those four things.
8570 : And of course, we have someone who is more than willing to serve as our errand [boy/girl].
8571 : Is that not right, %?
8572 : Return here once you have the appropriate items, and I will begin the ritual.
8573 : Until that time, I shall make preparations.
8574 : That girl has some nerve.
8575 : %, I would ask you to look after Arciela.
8576 : Why? I need not tell you that she always runs headfirst into danger.
8577 : %! It is good to see you here.
8578 : I came as soon as I heard that Ingrid was to examine my brother.
8579 : But since everyone has already left...how did the ritual go?
8580 : What will you say to her? Tell her about the curse and purging. Tell her that Ygnas's voice faltered. ...Arciela?
8581 : They're going to perform a purging ritual?
8582 : I see. So Ingrid feels it is a curse after all...but not the founder king's...
8583 : What!?
8584 : What could it mean that his voice faltered...?
8585 : My brother began to show symptoms right as the call went out for adventurers from the Middle Lands.
8586 : It started out as a simple rash. He said it might have been something he picked up in the forest...
8587 : He was still of human form, talking with me just as he had when we were younger...I can still hear his voice...
8588 : And then slowly he turned into what you see him as today, eventually losing all powers of speech.
8589 : And to think, even though you were able to communicate with him telepathically, now...
8590 : Does that mean the curse is still progressing? That this isn't the end?
8591 : Might he turn into a leafkin for good?
8592 : You are too kind to me. And you're right. It would not do for me to sit here and stew.
8593 : If you're going to help find the materials needed for this purging...
8594 : ...Then let me come with you. I'd do anything to see my brother whole again.
8595 : Just let me know whatever you need.
8596 : Ingrrrid herself has left me with a message for you.
8597 : You are to gather four items that have been touched by the Divine.
8598 : The firrrst, a piece of stone wall touched by the light of dawn. The second, holy water untainted by impurity.
8599 : The thirrrd, a flame that has gone unextinguished for seven years. The fourth, the wings of a weather vane that has stood the test of time.
8600 : Perhaps you could start by gathering information from the other exorcists. They would do their utmost to uphold Ingrid's wishes.
8601 : Hildebert's manse is not far from here. I suggest you pay his order a visit and see what information you can glean.
8602 : Ah yes, my dear adventurer. Come. We have been expecting you.
8603 : Vortimere himself has bid me hold on to something for you.
8604 : Here. This %.
8605 : This flame was bequeathed unto us by Moh Rihimi, a geomancer who lived many ages ago.
8606 : No evil force may come within several yalms of its blessed heat, and thus it has burned brightly without fail for years.
8607 : I can tell the fact that exorcists and geomancers once worked together confounds you.
8608 : We exorcists answer to a divine providence, yet do not define everything in black-and-white terms.
8609 : I have some inforrrmation for you on the other vessels which Ingrid bid you acquire.
8610 : Our research suggests that the stone wall touched by the light of dawn has something to do with Adoulin's porrrt district.
8611 : Sailors and captains of our fair city have a custom of honorrring the morning sun, and as such many of our vessels contain the word dawn in their names.
8612 : And as for the holy water untainted by impurity, we believe it to be located in the fountain in Western Adoulin's plaza.
8613 : The fountain's water is taken directly from the Rala Waterways underneath Adoulin proper, so it is both pure and clean.
8614 : Unforrrtunately we are at a loss as to where the wings of a weather vane that has stood the test of time might be.
8615 : However, we have contacted the scouts to gather intelligence. I suggest that you first head to the fountain to begin your search.
8616 : The holy water untainted by impurity unquestionably refers to the water of Western Adoulin's fountain.
8617 : We have also enlisted the aid of some scouts to help us investigate furrrther. Head first to the fountain to get the water, or find the stone in question.
8618 : My dearrr pioneer, we have located the weather vane that you seek.
8619 : To the south of this very plaza lies a larrrge manse whose storage unit contains such an object.
8620 : We have already discussed the issue with the owners, who are waiting for your arrrival at the manse to the south.
8621 : Well, what have we here? You must be the pioneer after that weather vane.
8622 : Me? The owner? Surely you jest--I'm just the hired help. But I do indeed have what you seek.
8623 : One of the older groundskeepers told me this piece has quite the history behind it. But it's seen better days, and has remained in storage for as long as I've been here.
8624 : Back many years ago, the northern wind blew toward Adoulin for the first time in centuries, carrying upon it a ravaging plague. This vane alerted the citizenry to its coming.
8625 : Of course, we now have remedies to combat such a disease, and this ol' thing has seen better days, so... Well, I needn't state the obvious.
8626 : Needless to say, no one could bear to part with something that saved so many lives.
8627 : That's why it's been buried away here for so long. Make sure you treat it well, 'hear?
8628 : Promise me you won't drop it on your way? My master would never forgive me.
8629 : You actually made it back in a reasonable time frame. I must admit to being mildly impressed.
8630 : Not that this puts you in my good graces, but Ingrid the Merciless knows to give credit where credit is due, adventurer from the Middle Lands.
8631 : Now that all my implements are here, there is naught to do but perform the purgation.
8632 : I-imposs...
8633 : I had hoped that...
8634 : It is as we feared. Such a strong curse could only be the work of the founder king.
8635 : Do you all believe me now? This self-absorbed girl could not dispel the darkness around Ygnas. The founder king's will has spoken!
8636 : Urk!
8637 : I cannot deny the intensity of this affliction. Perhaps my confidence got the better of me--this requires an even more elaborate ritual.
8638 : I must depart to ponder this further--but I'll be ready next time!
8639 : So you f-f-failed...
8640 : I must apologize for my inadequacy, Lord Vortimere.
8641 : N-n-no, my dear. You need not be sorry.
8642 : But...why?
8643 : This is the p-p-perfect opportunity, Ingrid. The more rituals we conduct, the more our influence grows.
8644 : But do not fail again. Should our authority come into qu-qu-question, all we have done will have been for naught.
8645 : Fear not, Lord Vortimere. I have no intention of losing face twice.
8646 : Our c-c-calling as exorcists is to rid Adoulin of forces most fiendish and foul.
8647 : And this is a task that must be entrusted to us, and n-n-no other.
8648 : Just think back, to the time of the G-G-Great Expedition. How valued were we then! And how valued we will be again!
8649 : C-c-colonization must continue...and yet there are many that would see it falter.
8650 : Ikhi Askamot dares not open her mouth, owing to the r-r-recent events at the coliseum, but too many of the other leaders remain hard-headed.
8651 : Ingrid, a question.
8652 : Of course.
8653 : You saw the g-g-grand chancellor up close. Were you able to...?
8654 : No. I did not have the opportunity.
8655 : I thought you of all p-p-people would have been able to understand.
8656 : I had suspected they would blather on about the founder king's curse, but this...
8657 : Pay it no further attention. We have more p-p-pressing matters to attend to.
8658 : I had n-n-not expected that girl to turn out to be such a threat.
8659 : It matters not whether she is telling the truth or l-l-lying about being able to hear Ygnas's voice, but no matter. Her getting in our way is inevitable.
8660 : %, whatever shall we do?
8661 : (Don't break...the...curse...)
8662 : (...hfff...)
8663 : (I can feel it...ness.)
8664 : (Something dread...ing this way.)
8665 : %...is my brother saying something?
8666 : (The key...right there...lead you...)
8667 : (.........)
8668 : (......)
8669 : (...)
8670 : The % begins to fade, taking Ygnas's voice along with it!
8671 : %, tell me! What did my brother say? He was pointing right at me!
8672 : A key...to lead us? What could he have meant?
8673 : Why, my dear, do you not see? The answer is in front of you, plain as day.
8674 : Arciela, you never desired colonization. By pointing at you, he meant that we should follow your true desires.
8675 : It can only mean that we must respect the will of the founder king, and that it would be a grave mistake to pursue colonization any further!
8676 : But, no! I...I...
8677 : A clever trick, Hildebert. But pray tell me--is that the only explanation?
8678 : Could it not mean that Ygnas wishes Arciela to continue colonization in his stead?
8679 : He may be wishing for her to become the standard-bearer of colonization.
8680 : Your insolence goes too far this time, Melvien!
8681 : Insolence? No. I have used only the most deductive of reasoning.
8682 : Countless hours have I spent poring over tomes and annals dating back to our very first colonization efforts.
8683 : You impudent fool! Who are you to look down on the founder king's dying words?
8684 : The lesson that the Great Expedition taught us was that the only way to appease him is to honor his spirit.
8685 : What we must do is cast off this ridiculous premise of rituals and purgations and revere the founder king as he demands!
8686 : Just as we did back then, we must go and reseal his tomb once more.
8687 : Hildebert! It is wholly inappropriate of you to make rash statements in such a place!
8688 : P-perhaps you are right...
8689 : It makes me wonder...do you not feel that the circumstances surrounding our colonization efforts are quite different from those of the Great Expedition?
8690 : Do we even have the time or money to appease his spirit?
8691 : Time or money!?
8692 : I imply nothing, my dear Hildebert, only that as the minister of finance, we must undertake all things with due caution.
8693 : Though many remember the Great Expedition for its ultimate failure, at the time Adoulin was able to receive much from the bounty of the wilds.
8694 : Should you doubt my words, I bid you head to the Celennia Memorial Library and read for yourself.
8695 : Do so, and you will understand why I staunchly support the colonization initiative.
8696 : Our nation has waned in influence since those grand times, though I fear such words will not sway you now.
8697 : And you would dare turn a matter of faith into one of coin!? You and your kind are a blight on this land!
8698 : Nothing could be farther from the truth. No, I cannot in good conscience support policies predicated on our people dying of hunger and languishing in the streets.
8699 : Are you mocking me?
8700 : This isn't about you, this is about not being able to wring blood from a stone!
8701 : Both of you, please!
8702 : Please, just...just stop...
8703 : Nooo...! However could it have come to this!?
8704 : You still do not understand, old fool?
8705 : This is deserved castigation at the hands of nature...your comeuppance for supporting the forbidden act of colonization and draining the lifeblood of this continent.
8706 : I agree that her curse is a result of her father's stance on colonization, but I think the agency behind her malady belongs to a different source.
8707 : This is nothing other than a premeditated conspiracy to hinder our colonization of Ulbuka.
8708 : And just who is capable of such a heinous act? Why, witches, of course.
8709 : Witches? Preposterous! Surely you cannot think their ilk still exists?
8710 : They exist without a doubt, and I fear we know them all too well.
8711 : I'm sure even you can't have forgotten about the destruction wrought by that monstrous coven...
8712 : ...No, you cannot possibly mean... That is downright absurd!
8713 : Your obsession with finding evil in every corner has gone too far. You exorcists are worse than zealots, you're--
8714 : I would stay my tongue if I were you.
8715 : Let's just say that it would do you well to remember what profession Hildebert's right-hand man is. You don't want Lord Vortimere discovering how incompetent you feel he is, do you?
8716 : Not another fight! I can't go anywhere anymore without seeing people at each other's throats...
8717 : What will you do? Comfort Arciela. Shut the Weatherspooners up.
8718 : You're right, %. I shouldn't let my emotions get the best of me.
8719 : That's why we can't just stand by and let their tempers flare.
8720 : No! You'll only be adding fuel to the fire, and we can't have this animosity over colonization spreading any further than it already has!
8721 : Who in the Goddess's auspices are you!?
8722 : Well, if it isn't the Middle Lander. And I see you brought the princess with you...
8723 : I humbly request that you two put this quarrel to rest. Stirring up each other's emotions won't solve anything, especially over something like this.
8724 : This isn't merely something, my dear princess. A girl has been cursed.
8725 : Slow down! Shouldn't we hear what Pollimio has to say before jumping to conclusions?
8726 : Now, sir, could you please tell us exactly what happened to your daughter Nyline?
8727 : Yes, of course. However, I doubt what I have to say will offer much insight. I barely understand her condition myself.
8728 : As I told the Peacekeepers earlier, my daughter has recently begun exhibiting rather strange behavior.
8729 : She wanders the streets night after night as one possessed. If no one is there to stop her, she unfailingly meanders into the wilds.
8730 : It's obvious she would act like that. This is a textbook example of a curse.
8731 : You are but preaching to the choir, and I tire of having to continually explain that.
8732 : My apologies, sir and madam...
8733 : You can ignore their aspersions. If you have anything else to add, we'd be grateful to hear it.
8734 : Let me think...
8735 : Well, once she has fallen into that state, her eyes wander as if staring at nothing in particular. Engaging in conversation with her is nigh on impossible.
8736 : Ah, but sometimes she will turn and face a certain direction, then unleash a barrage of incomprehensible gibberish.
8737 : Like I said before, despite giving off the appearance that her mind is somewhere else, the moment you look away, she vanishes into the woods.
8738 : I know not what would have become of my precious Nyline had those two kind souls at the bivouac not been there to see to her welfare.
8739 : And where is your daughter now?
8740 : She is in the next room over, fast asleep.
8741 : I see...
8742 : So...you two have cause to believe that these are signs of a curse?
8743 : And, Ingrid, you say you've heard of a similar phenomenon?
8744 : Indeed I have.
8745 : Whilst on my travels through the Middle Lands, I heard a tale of an individual who was afflicted by the curses of evil spirits. He was doomed to walk the streets of his city both night and day, without reprieve.
8746 : However, he left behind a legacy. To this very day, the people of his land dress up as ghosts once a year and have others chase after them. The pursuers even receive delectable confections for their efforts.
8747 : The origin of such festivities is almost certainly linked to a historical event in the distant past.
8748 : Why the participants would reward pursuers with candy is beyond me. What illogical traditions those easterners have.
8749 : I'd say that the practice likely comes from an ancient ceremony that served the same function as exorcisms do today.
8750 : My, my, my. To think that such a ludicrous custom would have a rich history behind it... A stunning story if ever I have heard one.
8751 : ...Thanks. I thought it was pretty good myself.
8752 : What!? You mean to say that you fabricated that whole explanation!?
8753 : Cassard, your blatant lack of diligence disturbs me. Our order would surely sink into disrepute with you at its helm.
8754 : While you've been content to remain snugly within your proverbial Ulbukan washbin, I've explored seas wider than you could possibly imagine and returned with a veritable treasure trove of information.
8755 : For example, did you know that people in the Middle Lands have, for some years, succeeded in communicating with the spirits of an ancient witch brood?
8756 : The name of that brood would not happen to be...the Dark Lilies...would it?
8757 : Ah, so you are familiar with them? I can't say as I am surprised, though, as everyone in the Order of Weatherspoon should have heard that name at some point.
8758 : Let's give you a challenge, then. What about the rumors that the troop of evildoers who skulk about the hinterland are the Dark Lilies' successors?
8759 : I refuse to believe such tripe.
8760 : Troop, you say? So there are multiple witches involved?
8761 : Yes. I can say with full confidence that this is the work of the Blackthorn Coven.
8762 : The Blackthorn Coven...
8763 : A tyrannous clan of apocalypses incarnate, they might as well be joined at the hip for how often they're seen apart.
8764 : They've set Eastern Ulbuka ablaze with their surreptitious experiments and single-handedly extinguished the burning passions of numerous pioneers.
8765 : They somehow continue to evade us, flying back into the forest only to bare their talons at a later date. No wonder they're also known as the Heinous Harpies.
8766 : It is this nefarious sisterhood to which your daughter has fallen victim!
8767 : No, you're wrong!
8768 : ...At least that's what I want to believe.
8769 : I understand that they may be likened to harpies, but I simply don't think they're capable of something like this.
8770 : What's more, % knows something about this Nyline incident that you don't.
8771 : Go on, tell them.
8772 : Yes, please. Indulge us, %.
8773 : What will you tell them? It might be the work of forest sprites. I don't know what she's on about.
8774 : I know you fancy yourself a jester of the highest degree, but this isn't the time for japes! Just tell us what you know.
8775 : I see... So, if she were called by forest sprites, then...
8776 : That is far enough, Arciela. You do not truly believe in this flagrant display of balderdash, do you? Does [he/she] have any evidence with which to support this outrageous argument?
8777 : ...We have enough, in my opinion.
8778 : For example, I've noticed a spiritual aura in the air ever since we entered this dwelling.
8779 : It's undeniably faint--almost like the scent of far-off flowers borne aloft on the morning breeze. However, I can still sense it... The feeling greatly resembles what % and I experienced when we met those spirits in the Ceizak Battlegrounds.
8780 : We'd have to investigate further before making any definite statements, but what % proposes seems more than plausible.
8781 : Auras hanging in the air? Flowery scents? Fie, I say! You employ florid metaphors to divert our attention from your specious reasoning. This is none other than the curse of the wilds!
8782 : Mister Pollimio is a leading figure of the colonization movement, and has been targeted precisely because of his position. His daughter and the chancellor have been cursed to show that not even the most influential Adoulinians are above the will of the woodlands!
8783 : With that, I bid you farewell. I have no more time to squander on sophistry when I'm expected at the Weatherspoon manse for vespers.
8784 : Pollimio, you would do well to leave everything to me. I shall make sure that you receive the full support of Hildebert as well.
8785 : Therefore, once we lift the curse, all I ask is that you grant us a few minimal favors.
8786 : I think you mean if you lift the curse. I honestly don't see you succeeding where your betters have failed.
8787 : Hmph. Squawk all you want, but when the time comes, you and the princess will be proven for the fledglings that you are.
8788 : Now, if you would excuse me, I have a citizen to save.
8789 : If he wants to waste his time praying, that's his prerogative.
8790 : We all know there's only one way to lift a coven's curse: send them back from whence they came!
8791 : Once this world is no longer defiled by their presence, the girl shall once again be free.
8792 : Let the fires of divine judgment cleanse them of their iniquity!
8793 : Who do I believe here? They both promise me my daughter's return to normalcy, but their methods seem diametrically opposed...
8794 : What about your %, %? Does it sense any abnormal presence?
8795 : Your % exhibits no reaction whatsoever.
8796 : Well, it doesn't have anything to do with the leafkin.
8797 : I guess that proves Cassard wrong. Your pome would surely have reacted in some way if the woods were involved.
8798 : Moreover, I seriously don't think the Blackthorn Coven has anything to do with this. That leaves--
8799 : Mistress Arciela... I beg of you, please save my daughter...
8800 : Don't worry, I'll do everything in my power to cure your daughter of this affliction. However, I'll need your help with something in order to accomplish that.
8801 : A strange spiritual energy permeates this room even as we speak.
8802 : Could either you or your daughter possibly have brought back any artifacts from the forest?
8803 : That seems highly unlikely. I may be a proponent of colonization, but I have personally never strode into the hinterland.
8804 : ...Ahhh, come to think of it, I did purchase an enchanting stone at the market the other day.
8805 : The vendor told me that it comes from deep within the Ulbukan jungle, and resembled no jewel or mineral I had previously seen.
8806 : Not only did it have a peculiar shape, but it was so overlarge that it could not fit in my palm. And the color! Upon first glance it was a stunning shade of crimson, but upon further inspection, it shone as warmingly yellow as the sun.
8807 : I rarely express any interest in expensive jewels, but I simply had to have this rare specimen for my collection.
8808 : It wonderfully complements my Altana-shaped tree root and the rock Sverdhried once slipped upon whilst climbing his eponymous hillock.
8809 : Many of my colleagues have also succumbed to the temptation of the collector, for we all possess menageries of bizarre objects.
8810 : In fact, the stone in question is said to have previously been worshipped as a vessel of transcendental power.
8811 : The merchant who sold it to me added that it could very well have been crafted for communion with a creator deity. He was not so forthcoming with a name of which one, but I am certain it must be important.
8812 : My daughter was captivated by the stone's mystic properties, even more so than me, so I bequeathed it unto her. ...Now that I mention it, her behavior started to change soon after receiving the stone.
8813 : Aha, so that stone's likely the culprit. Pollimio, would you mind if I met with your daughter? I have some questions for her.
8814 : Of course not. Do as you please. Her room is the next one over.
8815 : She's done it again, dear!
8816 : What!? She's gone!?
8817 : When I went to check on her, the window was open and she was nowhere to be seen!
8818 : Damn this curse! We'd best start looking for her immediately... Hopefully she has not gone far.
8819 : Let's help look for her, %!
8820 : Where do you suggest we start?
8821 : Where will you look for Nyline? The forest. All over town. The chest of drawers.
8822 : I hope you find a real sense of humor in there, because you're certainly not going to find a grown woman.
8823 : Great minds think alike!
8824 : So we agree that it's probably those spirits calling out to her again?
8825 : So you want to chase her down, then?
8826 : Let's do it! It'll be like a game of Peacekeepers and Pickpockets!
8827 : I doubt those sprites bear any ill will towards Nyline...
8828 : But I get the feeling that something awful will happen if she enters those woods.
8829 : Pollimio, could I ask you to please search the town while % and I look for her at the edge of the forest?
8830 : Ma'am, we'll let you know immediately once we find her, so please don't move from this spot.
8831 : Al-alright.
8832 : Understood.
8833 : I searched the city high and low but found not a trace of her. She must have ventured into the woods.
8834 : My poor, helpless Nyline...<sob>
8835 : Father!
8836 : Nyline!
8837 : I'm so happy you're okay! Arciela, thank you so much!
8838 : Hmph...
8839 : (Damn it.)
8840 : We are eternally grateful for what you and that frontier friend of yours have done for us, Princess. Oh, I almost forgot that pioneer friend of yours...
8841 : %. [His/Her] name's %.
8842 : Thank you as well, %. This reward may not be commensurate with that which you receive in the Middle Lands, but it is all I have on hand.
8843 : I apologize for the inconvenience I have caused you two, and may you never have to endure an ordeal such as this again.
8844 : Now maybe Mother can stop nagging you about getting suckered in by shady vendors.
8845 : Worry not, my love. I shall never purchase another obscure bauble as long as I live.
8846 : Hee hee hee, your daughter's right, Pollimio. There're likely ponzes upon ponzes of potential dangers lying in wait within the hinterland.
8847 : Until we know exactly how upsetting them will influence our own lives, we'd best be careful.
8848 : The girl speaks the truth. It is best to let sleeping chocobos lie, so we must never venture forth into the jungle again.
8849 : Please don't put words in my mouth. That's not what I was saying...
8850 : Either way, it seems that what was afflicting Nyline is no more.
8851 : If that is the case, then there is no reason for me to stick around. Goodbye.
8852 : I too must take my leave and inform Hildebert of what has transpired.
8853 : Neither of those two is willing to give an ilm... Is there nothing we can do to get them to cooperate?
8854 : Nevertheless, I can't believe your intuition, %.
8855 : If you hadn't told me she was summoned to the forest by spirits, I would never have noticed their aura in the house.
8856 : Nyline would also still be alone and confused in the heart of Hennetiel.
8857 : If we'd arrived even a few minutes later, she might've been eaten by Goddess-knows-what.
8858 : Got anything to say? I can't take credit for this. Yeah, you're rather sloppy.
8859 : That genuinely hurt my feelings, %. Could you please try to temper your words to sound a bit more constructive next time?
8860 : What? Why can't you take credit for this?
8861 : Wait, so someone gave you the idea when you found Nyline in the battlegrounds? Who could that be, I wonder...
8862 : He had... Black hair and a beard. Spindly gray hair and looked decrepit.
8863 : His clothes were.. White as Velkk slobber. Black as a mourning veil.
8864 : He wore... A mysterious mantle. The daintiest skirt I've ever seen.
8865 : He had with him... A sword that could pierce the heavens. A jewel-encrusted staff.
8866 : He must be a unique individual if you remember all that about him. An old man dressed all in black...
8867 : Aha, could that possibly have been Teodor?
8868 : I think you have your facts messed up, %. No one I know in Adoulin fits that description.
8869 : Let me think... The only mysterious guy I know of always wears black and has a pitch-black personality...
8870 : Aha, I bet you're thinking of Teodor!
8871 : That'd make sense. Seeing as how he's lived on the Ulbukan mainland for quite some time, he's sure to know things that we don't.
8872 : Yes...he would...
8873 : Hey, %, do you think that we should ask him about my brother?
8874 : Maybe he can shed some light on that situation, too.
8875 : %!
8876 : I just want to say...I believe in you! I know you can figure out what my brother wanted to tell us.
8877 : I'm not going to pawn off all the responsibility to you, though. I'll search for Teodor in my spare time as well.
8878 : Until we meet again, %!
8879 : That meddling princess and her adventurer pet! I feel as if they have made it their personal mission to assassinate my character!
8880 : Nothing good ever comes from being in the same room as them! Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!
8881 : Haaah...haaah...haaah. All right, Ingrid, calm down.
8882 : You can't have Vortimere getting wind of what happened...not after you promised him you wouldn't make another mistake.
8883 : Let the Middle Lander be. When all is said and done, no one would lend an ear to a money-grubbing outsider.
8884 : The true threat to the exorcists' resurgence is the princess.
8885 : Mark my words, Arciela V. Adoulin. Soon enough, you shall regret ever having crossed Ingrid the Merciless.
8886 : Well, I'll be. Look who it is!
8887 : .........Wait. Who are you again?
8888 : Heavens, where was it I saw you? Let me think. Was it the place...? With the thing...?
8889 : Oh, right! One of those pioneers that's on everyone's lips.
8890 : Was it...%?
8891 : Oh, hooray! I got it! I just knew I could!
8892 : But, sweet mercy, there's no time for small talk!
8893 : You, um...wouldn't happen to have seen the princess, would you?
8894 : Why, I mean Arciela, silly! ...But you knew that, didn't you?
8895 : So...you haven't. Oh dear, what a terrible conundrum! You don't suppose she ran off to the forest again?
8896 : About what will you inquire? Where Arciela is. Why she would go to the forest.
8897 : I... Well, to be honest, I'm not sure either.
8898 : Were you even listening to a word I said!?
8899 : I may do nothing all day but polish floors and scrub chamber pots, but certainly I deserve a little more respect!
8900 : But let's not reopen that wound, hmm?
8901 : I thought you would know better than I. After all, the two of you seem to have been through a lot together.
8902 : She tries to smile and laugh it off, but let me tell you--under that happy exterior, she's suffering inside. Yup!
8903 : <Whisper> I mean, have you heard about her brother?
8904 : He's just so...so...
8905 : So adorable! Eeek! I just want to squeeze him and bite those little toes off!
8906 : O-oh dear! I didn't say that, and no one can prove that I did!
8907 : Ahem. Be that as it may, Arciela is stricken with worry.
8908 : And not just for her brother, mind you. You should hear all the ruckus when the pro- and anti-colonization factions happen to meet in the halls!
8909 : It tears at her so much that I cannot blame her for wanting to escape from the castle.
8910 : It was just like back then...
8911 : What will you ask? Back then? Can you explain?
8912 : Explain? Well...
8913 : This is only a story I heard from my mother, who had been nursing Arciela after she was born. This was before Ygnas ascended to grand chancellor.
8914 : Ygnas was quite a clever young man, but still--a child is a child. His father was always droning on to him about whether or not colonization should recommence.
8915 : The castle grew dark, and the tension was so thick you could stab it with a fork.
8916 : Arciela always puts on that brave facade of hers, but she detests such heated arguments. She's always been quite sensitive and delicate, you see.
8917 : So one day, she said enough is enough, and left the castle for the wildlands.
8918 : Imagine! Such a place is dangerous even for prepared adults, so what hope could a young child have of coming back alive!?
8919 : Of course, a search party was dispatched as soon as they figured out what happened...but no one could find her.
8920 : Everyone had all but given up hope when, one week later...
8921 : One of the soldiers found her sound asleep in a grassy meadow, one of the few places where light shone through to the forest floor.
8922 : Arciela was surrounded by all manner of fauna, circled around her frail form as if protecting her.
8923 : The tale goes that when the party approached her, the beasts did not attack, but instead slowly left, one by one, receding back into the tree line.
8924 : But it gets stranger! One week she had been in the forest, yet there was not a single scratch upon her pale skin, and her tummy gave not so much as a single rumble.
8925 : And what's more, Arciela had not a single memory of what she had been doing during that time.
8926 : The only clue we had was a torn piece of cloth marked with a particular sigil that she clutched tightly in her left hand.
8927 : Inquire about what? The torn piece of cloth. The sigil.
8928 : The sigil? Why, I was just a sweet, innocent young girl barely about to blossom into a stunning young woman! Why would I know about that?
8929 : And will you please stop making that face?
8930 : Yes, a mere piece of cloth.
8931 : Well, when they saw the sigil embroidered on that piece of cloth, the heads of the Twelve Orders stood straight up in their chairs! ...Or so I've heard.
8932 : Hildebert said in his usual stuffy voice, To think that he would bring such shadows unto our fair city...
8933 : In other words, all those bigwigs felt that this man, whoever he was, was at Arciela's side. All too mysterious, don't you agree?
8934 : She came back to the castle happier than anyone had ever seen her.
8935 : Before that, she had been a bit of a shut-in, never passing through the castle gates, but she started to walk around the city more after the incident.
8936 : And when Ygnas took on the mantle of grand chancellor, she started venturing into Ulbuka more often.
8937 : And you know what? Things are just like they were then--never once did the denizens of the jungle so much as breathe on her.
8938 : It baffles me to the high heavens! Soldiers and pioneers come scurrying back with their tails between their legs, but some mysterious power shields our princess from harm.
8939 : Though she may be beloved by a certain portion of our citizenry, thanks to those events, there are more than a few who view her with unease.
8940 : Some even call her the...the Wildborn Witch!
8941 : Oh dear, my poor Arciela!
8942 : Why must people say such foul things? There's not a kinder soul in all of Adoulin. It burns my blood to even think of it!
8943 : Oh, %...I didn't mean to take it out on you. It's just...overwhelming, you know?
8944 : Now you understand why I believe she must be wandering the wildlands if she's not in the castle.
8945 : The next time you go to the Ulbukan mainland, please--bring her back with you.
8946 : How will you respond? Of course I will. I'm afraid I can't do that.
8947 : I'm so glad to hear you say that. I worry about her so...
8948 : But...why?
8949 : You're going to say that she probably needs some time alone to rest her weary spirit.
8950 : I suppose you're right. You understand her better than I do.
8951 : And your concern shows her trust in you is not misplaced.
8952 : Just promise me you'll look after her.
8953 : After all, we live in troubling times. Her brother needs her perhaps more than any of us do.
8954 : So, again, I...
8955 : B-by Altana! What's going on?
8956 : What's wrong? Out with it!
8957 : I-it's Arciela! She...she...!
8958 : She's been abducted by monsters!
8959 : Wh-wh-wh... Wh...
8960 : What!?
8961 : The princess--she's been taken by some horrible beast! If you are truly a friend to the order, then you must go to the wilds to rescue her!
8962 : Is it true that Arciela was spirited away? That poor girl!
8963 : If the latest reports are to be believed, then it is indeed true. Apparently a behemothic creature snatched her up in its jaws and fled to the jungle's inner recesses.
8964 : Perhaps snatched up is a tad euphemistic. From what I have heard, gulped down would be much more appropriate.
8965 : If that is the case, maybe she should swallow her pride and relinquish her title of Wildborn Witch.
8966 : Melvien! Do you understand just how inappropriate that was!?
8967 : My pardons, Gratzigg.
8968 : Still, I get the meataru of his argument.
8969 : She's wandered off into the forestaru hundreds of times and emerged without even a scratch.
8970 : Didn't she sleep-weep amongst the fauna all by her lonesome, too? She should be fine even if we make like trees and leave her alone.
8971 : Plus, maybe the beastaru just mistook her for one of its cubs and carried her back to its den!
8972 : It is completely absurd to even entertain such an idea!
8973 : I never knew how true rang the phrase Wise men speak because they have something to say, fools because they have to say something until now.
8974 : And would you care to impart to us your wisdom regarding this incident, Ingrid?
8975 : I witnessed the whole thing, and I must profess that the walking atrocity in question had nothing more on its mind than to tear our dear princess limb from--
8976 : I propose that we send a search party for Arciela, which I will command, as soon as possible. We cannot lose even a moment to superfluous debates simply for the sake of following procedure.
8977 : You nominate yourself as commander?
8978 : I thought that went without question!
8979 : I wh-wh-wholeheartedly approve this measure. After what has befallen Ygnas, Arciela is the last d-d-descendant of the founder king who can...lead our nation to glory.
8980 : There is no t-t-time to waste on mustering troops. The exorcists will be...happy to send their unit of elites...which can be m-m-mobilized immediately!
8981 : (How...weird.)
8982 : (I never would've thought I'd live to see Lord Vortimere volunteering to help Arciela, let alone put his most valued troops at risk on her behalf.)
8983 : (Being part of the founder king's lineage must be even more important than I'd thought!)
8984 : We would be ever so grateful for your help, Vortimere. I, for one, place the fate of our nation in your capable hands.
8985 : Th-th-thank you for the vote of confidence, Svenja. We shall not...b-b-betray your trust.
8986 : Your % glows brightly, grabbing your attention.
8987 : Its deep red hue can only be interpreted as a warning of ominous events to come.
8988 : I just had an epiphany! How about we have % take part in your expedition?
8989 : [He/She] has traversed the Ulbukan continent time and time again. [His/Her] expert knowledge of the field should be an invaluable addition to your squad!
8990 : With all...due respect, Lady Svenja, it would be d-d-detrimental for the country to rely upon an...outsider at this juncture.
8991 : [He/She] may be from another land, but Arciela has formed a deep bond with [him/her] that transcends nationality.
8992 : I am truly sorry to heap such an arduous task upon you like this, but would you do us the service of accompanying the exorcists in search of our princess?
8993 : What will you do? Accept the offer. Back down.
8994 : Oh, I cannot adequately express the depth of my gratitude toward you! What a kind soul you are.
8995 : I...I am immensely sorry to hear that.
8996 : Are you sure you do not want to reconsider?
8997 : Fret not, dear Svenya. Our exorcists are all...highly trained v-v-veterans who have proven themselves...irreproachable beyond the slightest d-d-doubt.
8998 : They are p-p-precisely what Adoulin needs to...subdue this t-t-terrifying menace!
8999 : If there is no further debate, I shall set about r-r-rallying my unit.
9000 : But, please, I b-b-beseech you...to keep this incident a secret. We wouldn't want our fair citizens to...worry over an issue that is basically s-s-solved, would we?
9001 : %.
9002 : The creatures that skulk amidst Ulbuka's wilds have claimed the lives of many an unprepared pioneer. It may well behoove you to acquaint yourself with your enemy before endeavoring to slay him.
9003 : Any questions for Melvien? How do I do that? Can you acquaint me with the tiger?
9004 : I must say that you have an excellent sense of humor. Sadly, however, I have been within the city walls the whole time and know practically nothing about the beast.
9005 : Why, the answer is right under your nose. The Pioneers' Coalition is here to serve pioneers. Though Lord Vortimere may have said to keep this under the table, I hardly think only mentioning a golden tiger would arouse suspicion.
9006 : However, it does intrigue me that-- Never mind. Forget I said a word.
9007 : I wish you a swift and convincing victory, %.
9008 : Come crawling back, have we, Middle Lander?
9009 : One would think you emerged from Svenja's own womb, the way she coddles you.
9010 : She may have forced me to enlist your help in this search, but remember this, you [churlish brute/tottering wench].
9011 : I, by my infinitely good graces, am allowing you to assist me--not the other way around. Got it?
9012 : Good. You are to report even the seemingly most insignificant pieces of information directly to me, no ifs, ands, or buts.
9013 : Why, if it isn't...
9015 : % %
9016 : %? I did not misremember your name, did I?
9017 : Oh, thank the heavens. I do remember clearly, however, that you were present at the fateful gathering of heads.
9018 : I am constantly dangling from a slippery precipice, upon which myriad critical matters hang in the balance. It certainly is a wonder how I manage to remember anything at all.
9019 : I suppose that is neither here nor there. I doubt you care to know why it was so hard for me to dredge your alias up from the riverbed of my mind.
9022 : You carry our nation upon your back as you clear the way for progress, and you are currently in the process of uncovering where the light from our brightest star has gone.
9023 : What would someone of your standing want with our Scouts' Coalition?
9024 : But first, let me preempt your inquiry with a corollary. Despite our collective effort to gaze above and beyond our borders, we still do not know what has become of that star.
9025 : Oh. But if you do not wish to know of her whereabouts, I have not a clue as to why you are here.
9026 : Ahhh, I see. That goliath with towers for teeth and forest-thick pelage is what you seek?
9027 : Regrettably, I haven't heard a whit about that particular colossus.
9028 : The feline part, though, does rub me a certain way.
9029 : I take it you've heard of Kumhau, the Flashfrost Naakual?
9030 : All other bestial hellions that stalk the Ulbukan jungle look up to him in fear.
9031 : If there were a creature on the whole continent who'd know this monstrosity's whereabouts, it'd be him.
9032 : Sorry that I have nothing further to offer, but I cannot imagine you need much more.
9033 : Where can you meet him? That would be pertinent information, indeed. He may be found prowling the banks of a lake that lies within Kamihr Drifts and is rent by the cries of deities.
9037 : As you will not be heading into battle, you'll require a special device to make your intentions known. Just a moment.
9038 : Here we go. Take this with you when you visit those snowy dunes that lie far to the northwest.
9039 : The Inventors' Coalition developed this %, and it releases a special noise when rung. To people like us, it's as silent as a snow-covered night, but for some creatures...let's say it gets their attention.
9040 : I will admit that this is neither an orthodox nor a safe method, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
9041 : I am loath to put someone who's done so much for our alliance in harm's way, but I cannot think of a more appropriate solution at this point.
9042 : Remember, emphasize that you harbor no ill will and are only there for the golden tiger. That will stem the tide of his rage and keep you alive...I hope.
9043 : Good luck out there. You'll surely need it.
9044 : Why, hello, %. What brings you back to Castle Adoulin?
9045 : What brings you here? I was supposed to meet someone. Where's Ingrid?
9046 : What? Ingrid told you to report directly to her once you had garnered any sort of intelligence?
9047 : How peculiar...
9048 : She informed me that her retainers had discovered the princess's location. They all departed some time ago.
9049 : I had assumed that you were among their ranks, but that is clearly not the case. I wonder why she would choose to leave you in the lurch.
9050 : Why am I not surprised to see you, %?
9051 : To heal the World Tree, we must ask the World Tree for its help. So, of course, I thought...
9052 : Ar...ci...ela...
9053 : Ygnas...Morimar told us the truth.
9054 : He said you were using the curse as a way to further understand the World Tree.
9055 : And the whole time, none of us knew.
9056 : %, show him what Sajj'aka gave you.
9057 : You show Ygnas the %.
9058 : Ygnas, do you see this % % has? It's to help us revive the World Tree.
9059 : But if what the dragon Sajj'aka says is true, then there is no place left in Ulbuka sacred enough to plant it.
9060 : He believes that we must use the World Tree itself if we are to make it whole again. What do you think he means?
9061 : ...
9062 : Ygnas...oh no! What if he can no longer speak?
9063 : ing... ee... af... gr...
9064 : Ygnas? I-I can't understand...
9065 : Ygnas!
9066 : Ygnas's voice grows soft and is beyond comprehension.
9067 : Even your % only echoes back the same cryptic passage.
9068 : %...did you understand what he said?
9069 : What did Ygnas mean? Green rafting. Grating cheese chaff. Tree grafting. Affixing grey eels. Bleeding afore greatness. Seeping granite afflatus.
9070 : [Green rafting/Grating cheese chaff/Affixing grey eels/Bleeding afore greatness/Seeping granite afflatus]? I don't understand...it doesn't seem to make any sense. Maybe he meant something else.
9071 : Tree grafting?
9072 : Isn't that where you take part of one tree and attach it to another so they both live? Oh, %, you're magnificent!
9073 : Ygnas...thank you.
9074 : One issue remains. How are we supposed to graft a sapling to roots buried so far underground?
9075 : !? %, did you see that?
9076 : Was that...Ygnas?
9077 : Ygnas!?
9078 : Oh, thank goodness. He appears to have merely passed out.
9079 : Was that...a forest? Are you telling us to search for it?
9080 : Feeling a bit lost? I'm sure someone at the Pioneerrrs' Coalition can help you.
9081 : <Sigh>... No one at the castle could believe their ears when I told them of Melvien's disappearance--least of all the other ministers. I suppose there's no helping that.
9082 : How do you respond? You must have had your hands full. I suppose not.
9083 : I'm so glad you stuck with me through it all, %.
9084 : I have begun to open my eyes to the world ever since we first met. There was so much I didn't know--about pioneering, the jungle, and even my own homeland.
9085 : Every step is a new journey. Cooped up in the castle like I was, I forgot what real life was like.
9086 : But you showed me that I must not be content with how I am right now, that I must continue to push myself each day. For that, I will always be grateful.
9087 : I'd like to present you with a little something, from both me and my brother.
9088 : I know these trinkets aren't much, but they're artifacts that symbolize important moments in Adoulin's history.
9089 : I'd like to let you have them all, but...
9090 : Tra...di...tion...
9091 : Hee hee, Ygnas wants to say that our tradition is to let those who served the house well choose one.
9092 : Which would you like? The %. The %. The %.
9093 : This one?
9094 : Are you sure? Yes. No.
9095 : I hope you will treat it as it is--a valued heirloom.
9096 : Do you remember that ancient Adoulinian song I sang back on Mount Kamihr?
9097 : Maybe Morimar is right.
9098 : The light of dawn comes from the east.
9099 : I, for one, believe you pioneers have been sent to rescue this land.
9100 : Forgive me if my words cause undue burden.
9101 : The World Tree may be safe, yet Adoulin's struggles are far from over.
9102 : But as long as we live, we will keep fighting.
9103 : And, %...we will continue to need your help.
9104 : Though storms may brew and threaten the land, There is one shining star that shall help us to stand.
9105 : It remains resolute before man, before beast, And brings with it a song, a bright hope when fortune has ceased.
9106 : This ally is just, its eyes raised to the sky...
9107 : ...Protecting us from our foes...
9108 : ...A blessing from on high.
9109 : Well, I'll be! Look who's come to visit the castle!
9110 : Who're you again? Hehehe, gotcha! Of course I remember you, %!
9111 : But I'm not gonna pull your leg outta its socket this go. No, there's something I wanna talk to you about.
9112 : C'mon! Let's go somewhere quiet.
9113 : The princess has been moping about lately...and if anyone knows what happened to her, I figured it'd be you.
9114 : I tried asking Cynthia, but she never gives me a straight answer, and given the way she nods off while on duty...well, you're just a better person to ask.
9115 : Sweet mercy, say something! I'm not letting you budge until you spill the beans!
9116 : The Peacekeepers' Coalition has arrived at the only reasonable conclusion: the wounds on his body are signs of a struggle.
9117 : Beyond doubt. What concerns me more is his motive for escaping unfettered to such a desolate wasteland.
9118 : Listen to the two of you--dullarrrds to a fault.
9119 : Stay your tongue, Lhe!
9120 : Oh, please. There's nothing to be gained wrrringing your hands over the past.
9121 : Riddle me this--the head of one of our twelve esteemed orders shirrrks his duties to go gallivanting in the forest and he ends up sleeping with the fishes.
9122 : He's made a laughingstock out of all of us!
9123 : Lhe, do you not think--
9124 : He was a fool! He grew complacent, thinking Eastern Ulbuka safe and forgetting what it means to fear the forest!
9125 : When Ygnas ordered colonization to commence, we all knew that there would be prrrices to be paid. Let there be no doubt--Melvien dug his own grave.
9126 : So stop shedding tears for that morrron, or else we won't be able to move forward!
9127 : Lhe's words may be verbal briars, but I find myself in total agreementaru.
9128 : And Melvien supported colonization more than any of us, so the rumor-wumors going about town don't surprise me in the least!
9129 : Rumors? What rumors?
9130 : That Melvien's death was not a coincidence, but rather a carefully orchestrated plotaru by those opposed to our explorations on the continent.
9131 : How dare you!? You waltz in here after contributing nothing for months, and have the gall to--
9132 : Stop your whining, Gratzigg. I didn't say I'm a believer--just that hushed words and furtive glances are being exchanged in dank taverns and back alleys.
9133 : <Sigh>
9134 : Stop hemming and hawing, Margret. If you have something-womething to say, then out with it.
9135 : Rumors are a vicious thing, Chero-Machero. Forgive me for thinking out loud, but...
9136 : ...Couldn't it also be that a radical faction of colonization supporters assassinated Melvien to cast aspersions on those opposed?
9137 : Unthinkable-winkable! Explain yourself!
9138 : Melvien exerted a disproportionate amount of influence over those in his camp. None of us can deny it.
9139 : He spent so much time and effort sending swords into the wild, is it so unthinkable that one found its way into his back?
9140 : Whose side are you on, Margret? We've always counted on the Order of Haverton's support!
9141 : This is not about political posturing. I'm simply ensuring that we're properly diligent in considering all perspectives.
9142 : You disgust me. You are not considering all perspectives, just stirring the pot! This nation is divided enough without you deepening the rift.
9143 : I've done nothing other than provide an alternative hypothesis. The only one who truly knows what happened is the man himself, and without further evidence we cannot but speculate.
9144 : I'm surrre we all value your opinion.
9145 : Get back to your books and leave the discussion to those more qualified.
9146 : <Sigh> We had all our duck-wucks in a row, and something like this has to happen.
9147 : Enough with this senseless bickering. We all know why we are here today, and I bid us get started.
9148 : You sure spin a vivid yarn, %! I felt like I was right in the action myself!
9149 : But wait--that's not what matters here!
9150 : No wonder the princess is so in the dumps. And Cynthia, too, the poor thing. Dozing off at her post from all the stress.
9151 : Hmm... If there's one thing that'll cheer them up, it's got to be...
9152 : Tomatoes!
9153 : By now you've got to be familiar with the % grown down in Rala Waterways. Red as the setting sun, and plump and juicy, to boot!
9154 : And who do you think brought the tomato plants back from Eastern Ulbuka?
9155 : Who brought the tomatoes back? The effervescent Fremilla. The intrepid Arciela.
9156 : None other!
9157 : ...I wish! But I can tell by your face you knew that already. Hmph.
9158 : ...C'mon, couldn't you let a gal have just one?
9159 : You're right, of course. She found several sprouts while out exploring, and that's why we're able to grow them here today. What better way to turn her frown upside down than by reminding her of the good she does for the city?
9160 : So shove off to the Civic Arboretum and procure me some veggies!
9161 : You don't know how much time you'd be saving m...err, just picture the look of gratitude on the princess's face!
9162 : The princess has always been a connoisseurrr of fine vegetables. Surely fresh tomatoes will cheer her up.
9163 : But wasn't that Fremilla's job...?
9164 : %! You came! Thank goodness Fremilla reached you in time.
9165 : That strong landshiver caused some grave damage to various sections of Rala Waterways, and the Order of Renaye is in utter disarray.
9166 : They claim, the currents have shifted.
9167 : This cannot bode well.
9168 : I wish I knew more, but I learned only the fundaments of geomancy from my tutors.
9169 : Someone more versed in the issue from the Order of Renaye will be visiting the castle shortly, and I want you to be there with me.
9170 : How do you respond? The Order of Renaye? Of course I'll be there.
9171 : Surely you are aware of their geomantic activities here in Ulbuka. The order's head and minister of education, Ikhi Askamot, will come to proffer her opinion.
9172 : I felt a duty to accompany Ikhi to Leafallia in light of the events that transpired in Kamihr Drifts.
9173 : Some things are easier to understand in person.
9174 : Since that time, Ikhi has approached me with increasing frequency.
9175 : She has always been a bit...well, I hesitate to say standoffish, because that implies a lack of concern...but she is a woman of few words.
9176 : That makes approaching her a bit of a task, and one that I shied away from until recently--a failing of mine as one of the prominent faces of Adoulin.
9177 : But ever since we met, I have learned so much. About myself, about the world...
9178 : ...But we've no time for musings. Come. The council awaits.
9179 : This meeting better get underway soon. I don't trust my good-for-nothing suborrrdinates to even sweep the floors, let alone run things in my absence.
9180 : Oh, Lhe, ever the sourpuss. Ikhi never would've called us here if she didn't have something important to say--and it may provide some juicy tidbits that will help you and yours.
9181 : One can only hope.
9182 : Ikhi, please. We are all interested in hearing your observations.
9183 : I'm afraid the situation is grave. An area of the waterways...has collapsed.
9184 : That landshiver-wiver sent my shelves tumbling to the ground, so it's not surprising that dilapidated cesspool would cave in. We'll just have to repair it. What's the problem?
9185 : Just draw up a quick budgetaru and I'll hire some workers to get it patched up in no time.
9186 : All things in this world are in flux. What once had form will return to dust. This is an immutable law of nature.
9187 : We mustn't lay blame on things that break...it is the way of things.
9188 : Huh? You're off flapping-wapping your gums, but all I hear is nonsense.
9189 : C'mon, Ikhi--stop pretending to be all cryptic and mysterious, and say what you mean! You're the head of an order-worder, not a babbling doomsayer!
9190 : I'm...I'm sorry.
9191 : Argh! I'm not even that mad--I just want you to be more clear!
9192 : Be direct and to the pointaru. We're all listening.
9193 : Go on!
9194 : Damn you, woman, out with it!
9195 : How do you respond? Make him shut up. Give him a kick to the rump.
9196 : %? Just what are you...?
9197 : G-get away from me! Your hovering-wovering is making me ill!
9198 : G-get away from-- Mmph! Mmph!
9199 : Stop cover-wovering my-- Mmmmmmph!
9200 : <Gurgle>
9201 : Ikhi, are you trying to say that the Ergisade has been shattered?
9202 : The Ergisade? Hildebert, I am not familiar with such a name.
9203 : Forgive me, Arciela, for keeping its existence a secret from you.
9204 : Ikhi, if I may?
9205 : Arciela, surely you remember the plot to assassinate Ygnas that your pioneer companion managed to foil.
9206 : Of course.
9207 : When I saw that Ygnas had been transformed into that most curious form, I began to doubt that the catalyst was the curse of the founder king after all.
9208 : I consider myself a lettered man, and happen to know a good deal about the events that transpired during the Great Expedition.
9209 : August appeared before the king and the heads of each order in their dreams, beseeching them to cease making inroads into Ulbuka.
9210 : This was but one of several incidents that spurred them to turn tail and seal themselves within the city walls.
9211 : Not content with merely heeding the founder king's warning, Adoulin's ruler created a new grave in honor of August's memory deep within Rala Waterways.
9212 : I trust all present are familiar with this part of the story.
9213 : %, you are not of our land. Do you need me to go over the details once more?
9214 : Should Hildebert repeat his explanation? No need. Please. I didn't quite catch everything.
9215 : Understood. But pay careful attention this time.
9216 : ...Yet honoring August's memories is but half of the truth.
9217 : Arciela, you are not the head of house, and hence have not been apprised of the full story. Yet I would be remiss to hide information from you as the future stands poised in the balance.
9218 : Allow me to shed some light on the story and reveal to you the truth.
9219 : %, you should be privy to this as well. I am nothing if not pragmatic, but I cannot vouch for your future here should my words ever leave this hall.
9220 : I would trust [him/her] with my life.
9221 : Hildebert, your riddles rival those of Ikhi. What is this half-truth of which you speak?
9222 : The shrine dedicated to August is more than just a memorial--it is a giant geomantic seal.
9223 : A seal...containing the spirit of August himself?
9224 : I am not versed in the particulars, but whether it be his spirit or his will, the fact remains that the founder king held great sway over the city long after his death.
9225 : It loomed over the populace, threatening it with divine punishment should they not heed his warnings.
9226 : As the Great Expedition progressed, pioneers reported seeing his form appearing before them. Though this phenomenon was originally denounced as hallucinations born from overwork, it was not long before an epidemic broke out among the populace.
9227 : Ill fortune also befell the heads of the twelve orders, and the citizenry was paralyzed with fear of something they could feel, but not touch.
9228 : The king of the age, vexed and nearly hysterical, turned the city itself into a barrier to ward off evil spirits.
9229 : But how is such a thing even possible?
9230 : He constructed waterways deep beneath the city. The citizenry was informed of naught but that they were to make life in Adoulin self-sustaining.
9231 : That was merely a front. The waterways themselves are veins in a large magical apparatus flooded with geomantic energies.
9232 : And, like most veins, the blood flows back to the heart--the grave of the founder king.
9233 : (This must be the seal Morimar was referring to back in Kamihr Drifts.)
9234 : The most storied geomancer of the time oversaw the project from commencement to completion, and even the slightest bends and the most miniscule differences in elevation were carefully planned out to draw geomantic wards around the city.
9235 : And the very water itself, ostensibly for purposes of sustenance and irrigation, is in fact a physical means to carry forth spiritual energies.
9236 : Their directionality, fixed for centuries, is of utmost import to the type of magic the wards compart. For years, they have served to divert harm from the city to the outside world.
9237 : But why? August was the man who saw our great nation rise. Why would they fear one we owe so much to?
9238 : Even though he may have brought great good upon our city, there is one undeniable fact--the only thing man fears more than that which he does not know is that which he knows only in part.
9239 : Yet their caution appears to have been well placed. Up until now, no other calamity has befallen our land, and we have been content to live in peace for several centuries.
9240 : And now...it's broken.
9241 : Who cares!? If it broke-woke, then we fix it! I don't see any problem!
9242 : The lot of you sit here chit-chattaruing and wringing your hands when there's progress to be made! No wonder it's taken us this long to get where we are!
9243 : <Blink>
9244 : What's with you people? Once we find the money-woney, it'll be a snap!
9245 : Up and at 'em! Just spend some coin, hire a bunch of those pioneers to get on it, and--
9246 : H-hey! Not again--!
9247 : It's...it's not that simple.
9248 : Whatever do you mean?
9249 : The inscriptions have been overwritten.
9250 : Overwritten!?
9251 : Perhaps a visual aid will help.
9252 : Take a look.
9253 : This is a device my order refers to as a crux. Trained individuals can use it to read the currents of the lifestream. This particular device has been attuned to the Rala Waterways.
9254 : Now...
9255 : See how it is contorted? This means that the incantation...has been transposed into something else.
9256 : But as to exactly how... That's something I can't tell without visiting the site directly.
9257 : But, Ikhi, do you think that wise, with all the beasts lurking down there?
9258 : Then your choice to call % was a prudent one. [He/She] can go places we cannot.
9259 : I wholeheartedly approve. [He/She] has proven [his/her] worth many times thus far.
9260 : And further, what was discussed in this room must not be shared with others, and hence we can only trust one from this congregation.
9261 : %, your service to the city has been more than mere happenstance.
9262 : Having Arciela vouch for you is proof beyond doubt.
9263 : Then we are in accord.
9264 : %, we anxiously await your successful return.
9265 : How do you respond? I'll do all I can. I've no time for such nonsense.
9266 : It is not nonsense, %. The fate of Adoulin lies in the balance.
9267 : The Twelve Orders have tasked you with surrrveying Rala Waterways?
9268 : I would advise you to bring prrrotection. The recent landshivers may have loosened a few stones in the ceilings.
9269 : %, you made it back whole! With all that trekking and fighting, you must be positively exhausted, but I'm afraid we haven't much time.
9270 : Please--what happened?
9271 : Yes, we must know.
9272 : The flow of water has changed?
9273 : Wh-what!? An explosion and a bright flash of light? What on Vana'diel--!?
9274 : And this is...%? Then that huge shaking wasn't a landshiver, but rather...
9275 : I was afraid of this...
9276 : Arciela, it's as I told you: the currents changed not of their own accord, but by the hand of another.
9277 : Every ripple, every breath...all worked in concert, forming a barrier that forestalled spirits of a most foul nature.
9278 : A barrier to ward off evil?
9279 : Exactly. It has served its purpose well. Yet Ygnas's transformation into a leafkin was not only the doing of the founder king--he surely had help from the World Tree.
9280 : The founder king's grave is the heart of the barrier, both physically and aetherically. A force far beyond our comprehension has held the seal together.
9281 : And the grander a force is, the more likely even the smallest of deviations will sow discord. The founder king's will has come under assault countless times, so it is no surprise that eventually part of it should yield...
9282 : ...And the calamities that have begun to befall us are the direct result of this.
9283 : Yet what piques my curiosity most is that which % found in the waterways.
9284 : Changing the natural flow of water is like asking a tree to bend against the wind. But were the tree to be cut down instead...
9285 : The explosion has caused the entire incantation to be overwritten. The protections placed over the city have begun to fade.
9286 : But, if the incantation has changed...
9287 : The question is, What has it been changed to?
9288 : Sadly, my crux can only detect that it has changed.
9289 : I surmise that the currents flowing from this world into the next, warding off various and sundry evils from passing through the ethereal barrier separating them, have been reversed.
9290 : Reversed? Which means what, exactly?
9291 : That which had warded now beckons.
9292 : Its essence shielded all life from that which would wreak uncontrolled destruction, but now...it's but a matter of time before true terror is made manifest.
9293 : In this corrupted, Stygian tide, the city will sink into the underworld...
9294 : I speak, of course, of the incantation itself. No longer does it keep demons out--it draws them in.
9295 : The city itself will soon be under assault. How long before it succumbs, I do not know.
9296 : Any questions? So it now draws in monsters? What are you implying?
9297 : Mayhaps my previous explanations were insufficient, but yes--that's exactly what it does.
9298 : I hardly need spell out what this means for the future of our once-peaceful nation.
9299 : But in the worst case...the city itself may be absorbed into another dimension.
9300 : What!?
9301 : The other orders will surely not believe these words wholesale, but someone must inform them of the danger and lead us to conquer the evil within.
9302 : Yet, that task must fall to someone other than me.
9303 : Arciela... You bore witness to all the events that have transpired in the forest. I can think of no other--both as a person and as the bloodline of the founder king.
9304 : I suppose...
9305 : I suppose you're right. I'll do all I can.
9306 : Ikhi, I ask that you share with them the same tale you have just shared with us.
9307 : Then it is decided. We'll convene a meeting of the twelve orders posthaste.
9308 : We must make clear what really happened in the waterways...and Leafallia.
9309 : %, you've always given me the courage to go on. I'd like you to be present, too.
9310 : Will you assist Arciela? Certainly. I would never disappoint you.
9311 : Your response warms my heart.
9312 : Then I must make the appropriate preparations...
9313 : Of course. We must convince them, at any cost.
9314 : %, I have to get ready, too. Let's meet up here once everyone's set.
9315 : Until then.
9316 : Arciela has never called such a meeting of the Twelve Orders with such urrrgency.
9317 : She has informed us that you are to be present. I'll purrrmit you entry once the heads have assembled.
9318 : Who does that upstart think she is, summoning the heads of the Twelve Orders just to make us wait!?
9319 : Indubitably-wubitably! We've more pressing matters to deal with than the whims of some young girl.
9320 : And it's all because Melvien had to kick the bucketaru.
9321 : Ugh, I can't believe we leaders have been reduced to mere paper-shuffle-wufflers.
9322 : Thanks to his reckless antics, colonization's practically been slowed to a haltaru. If only he'd kept his nose stuck in his books, then we wouldn't be stuck in this bureaucratic-watic quagmire.
9323 : Could you please be a little more considerate of the deceased?
9324 : I...I was just saying what everyone was thinking. I don't see the harm in that. Plus, it's not like he'll rise from the grave to seek revenge because I hurtaru his feelings posthumously.
9325 : My apologies, everyone. I did not expect to take so long.
9326 : I hope you do not intend to start the meeting on as short notice as you sent out those summons. Some of us still have yet to arrive!
9327 : I have something to say that simply cannot wait. Please, the future of Adoulin lies in the balance!
9328 : ...The future of Adoulin, you say?
9329 : I was under the impression you were only investigating what took place in the waterways.
9330 : I was.
9331 : Well, thank the Goddess that we dropped everything so this royal runtaru could waste our time with information on Watergate.
9332 : Didn't you know Reginald and Amchuchu are already flexing their mental mightaru to come up with a solution for that? Anyway, on to something of substance-wubstance.
9333 : Condition-witions in the hinterland are growing worse by the day.
9334 : Heretofore unseen monstarus have been brazenly appearing before coalition staff even at high noon.
9335 : Livestock go missing-wissing after the fences erected to protect them miraculously break.
9336 : Whole fields of crops are supposedly withering overnightaru.
9337 : Like rats from a sinking ship, the smaller beasts of the forest trample-wample each other in an effort to take refuge on the coast.
9338 : Just what are they fleeing-weeing from?
9339 : Could it possibly have something to do with the recentaru spate of landshivers?
9340 : What an utterly terrifying prospect that is...
9341 : As the person in charge of the colonization initiative, these issues seem much more prrressing than a little underground mishap.
9342 : Say your piece, Arrrciela, but make it snappy.
9343 : Then allow me to get right to the point.
9344 : The tunnel collapse in the waterways and subsequent change in water flow down there was not the result of a landshiver.
9345 : What sort of rrridiculousness are you hinting at?
9346 : Care to elaborate for us, Ikhi?
9347 : The waterways were attacked by a living person. Why? To rrreplace the geomancy within them.
9348 : The divine magic that once safeguarrrded the area has been supplanted by evil sorcery.
9349 : You mean to say that someone annulled the only entity keeping us from certain death!?
9350 : There is no need for theatrics, Hildebert. Please, just calm down.
9351 : Theatrics!?
9352 : The last bulwark against the overpowering thaumaturgical forces slobbering at our gates just fell and you accuse me of theatrics!?
9353 : Ikhi says the Ergisade has been supplanted by another form of magic, meaning that it has vanished completely!
9354 : For all intents and purposes, we have reverted to the age of the Great Expedition!
9355 : The curse of the founder king shall descend upon Adoulin once more...
9356 : Our thriving society will be utterly ruined! If only we had not begun raping the land by trying to colonize it.
9357 : I scoff-woff in your general direction, Hildebert. If we had a pinch of bayld for every hole in your logic, we could build a new waterway out of solid gold!
9358 : Besides, who cares if some musty superstition's no longer sealed away? I know I'm not afraid of any evil spiritaru.
9359 : Even if I were, though, you could simply deploy your vastaru army of Weatherspoon exorcists and hocus-pocus it away!
9360 : You could hold a grand-scale Wake of the Lilies and curry-wurry pioneer support as well!
9361 : Hey, how about chantaruing a ritualistic phrase like The power of Altana compels you to get people more involved?
9362 : Yes, and I'll have the Ministry of Commerce sponsor vendors. We'll all be swimming-wimming in bayld!
9363 : You know not of what you speak, Chero-Machero!
9364 : At least I know what I ate this morning, you old fartaru!
9365 : Calling our founding father an evil spirit to hocus-pocus away is an affront to our whole civilization!
9366 : Pardon my naivet. I didn't realize I had free reign to curse-wurse my own people as long as I founded their home millennia ago!
9367 : Even the village idiotaru knows that someone who harms an entire city should be considered evil!
9368 : I beg of you. Do not let your emotions get the better of you.
9369 : There is something I must s--
9370 : World-shattaruing news, everyone!
9371 : Reginald and I just returned from surveying the damage in Rala Waterways and made a startling discovery-wovery!
9372 : Those walls didn't come crumbling-wumbling down because of a landshiver!
9373 : You may need to take a seataru for this! They fell at the hands of a living being!
9374 : Isn't this the most shock-wocking news of your lives!?
9375 : ...Apparently not? But why!? I'm positively befuddle-wuddled.
9376 : Because Ikhi just got done telling us the same thing. You were close, though.
9377 : Awww, but close only countarus in On the Dot and hand grenades.
9378 : How about this juicy-wuicy bit of intelligence, then?
9379 : The explosive-wosive used was so ancient, as far as I know, the only person who'd have the knowledge to build it is Melvien.
9380 : What did you say!?
9381 : I said the design was ancientaru. In other words, really old.
9382 : No, not that! The part where you implied Melvien built it.
9383 : Ah, yes. The distinguishing characteristic is the fuse. From what I gleaned, it looks as if one can set the time at which the device detonatarus.
9384 : The technology employed dates back to the great war that raged long ago. I remember him showing me a diagram-wiagram of it in his notebook, and the remains of this one match it perfectly.
9385 : As I have never seen one in these lands before, I postulataru that Melvien was intimately acquainted with its workings...but this doesn't come as a surprise either, does it?
9386 : You people are no fun-wun at--
9387 : What was that!?
9388 : What do you suppose this means for us?
9389 : ...Ummm, sorry to barge in on your tipitty-top secret conversation, but...
9390 : Isn't there something...uh...off about all this?
9391 : What would a lowly servant know of critical analysis? It is hardly your place to sp--
9392 : I think we all know that Melvien's gone to the big treasury in the sky, tee hee.
9393 : But if that's true, how could he have made the bomb go boom-boom? I think it's downright mean and rude to frame someone when he can't defend himself!
9394 : Wait a second! I never said anything about him being the culpritaru. Besides--
9395 : Shhh! I'm trying to think!
9396 : Eureka! My muse has inspired me!
9397 : I know who did it!
9398 : Now you listen-wisten here, you--
9399 : Wait, you know who did it? This I simply mustaru hear. Please, humor us.
9400 : Okay! The culvert is...
9401 : A topic we'll talk about later!
9402 : Being in front of you all has given me a case of the tummy twitherym. I need some fresh air...
9403 : Or maybe some dessert?
9404 : I could really go for something sweet after using all that brainpower!
9405 : Why's everyone so quiet?
9406 : Or, an even better question. Is Melvien really dead?
9407 : Did you search every itty-bitty nook and cranny of his body to make sure?
9408 : I, Fremilla, the legendary sleuth of Adoulin, will answer what all you inquiring minds wish to know!
9409 : And that is the name of the percolator!
9410 : Which is... Wait for it...
9411 : Melvien! His crime? Being too handsome!
9412 : His chiseled jaw and burning passion for life are enough to make any woman die of longing!
9413 : Tee hee hee.
9414 : Ah, yes, death--the savior of all, release from constant suffering.
9415 : I can barely contain myself thinking of all the fun we're going to have together...bweeheehee.
9416 : Bwahahahahahaha!
9417 : %, you don't think this means...
9418 : I have had it up to here with your nonsensical japes! This is not a schoolyard, but a seat of government!
9419 : If you are unwilling to contribute to the discourse, then remove--
9420 : Mwrf!?
9421 : I don't think I'm finished yet, Gramps. In fact, I'm just getting started.
9422 : Why don't you take a seat?
9423 : ...Hm? Why's everyone getting cold feet? This is the part where things really heat up.
9424 : ...H...Hildebert!?
9425 : Nice cadenza, my dear Svenja.
9426 : I'd like nothing more than to move to a canto at this point, but I fear we've already reached the coda.
9427 : You're all unbearable idiots.
9428 : Talk about melodrama! You all constantly squabble over the most trivial of things.
9429 : And everyone's content to play King Diddly of the Squat Islets.
9430 : Then there's this whole inner struggle over colonization. To be for it or against it? It's certainly a dumb question when nothing ever gets accomplished.
9431 : The Twelve Orders?
9432 : More like the Twelve Disorders! At best, you're a disease that's slowly killing the nation.
9433 : Hm?
9434 : Whoopsie.
9435 : Maybe I got a bit out of character.
9436 : Oh, well, you were all bound to find out eventually. Let's lift the curtain on this climax!
9437 : What the...!?
9438 : Fremilla!?
9439 : Greetings, leaders of the Twelve Orders.
9440 : My name is Balamor, but you may know me by other fantastical names such as The Deathborne Xol.
9441 : Dead born what? Zall? Sounds like a ridiculous villain made up by a Galka youngling-woungling!
9442 : However, I'm playing only a supporting role. Let's all give a standing ovation to the antihero of this moving tragedy!
9443 : But...how!?
9444 : A demon...in the castle!? ...What is this city...coming to...?
9445 : Melvien!
9446 : I assume all of you are present?
9447 : Why, hello there, Arciela. How nice to know that you made it back in one piece.
9448 : Heh heh, but it seems that you have not been completely honest with them.
9449 : Do they understand the extent of the horrors that took place in that village deep within the jungle?
9450 : Do they understand the extent to which that friend of yours was involved?
9451 : And do they understand exactly what you did to me?
9452 : You're one to talk!
9453 : I advise you not to employ intellectually dishonest tactics here. They will only serve to further tighten the noose around your neck.
9454 : The more you try to conceal facts, the more seeds of curiosity you sow. Eventually those seeds will sprout and bear the fruit of dissent. You had best repent before you are forced to eat the ire of every other order leader here.
9455 : Although it pains me to say so, I have preparations to which I must attend.
9456 : Fare thee well, and may you all be able to play nice for a tad bit longer.
9457 : Pweh heh heh, that was a rather staccato intermezzo.
9458 : I guess I should take a bow and head offstage as well. I wouldn't want to leave you thinking I'm a mere extra in this production, though.
9459 : Therefore, why don't I give you something to remember me by?
9460 : Oh, that reminds me. I heard something about...what was it called again? Ah, the curse of the founder king.
9461 : Apparently, all your ancestors who ignored the king's dying words met with unfortunate ends. Now that's the kind of story that jingles my bells.
9462 : You are a wanton degenerate if that brings you any sort of joy!
9463 : In due time, you'll all be ballyhooing like when colonization was given the boot.
9464 : What kind of a farce-warce is this?
9465 : Nothing's differentaru at all.
9466 : No need to rush. I said in due time, remember?
9467 : But maybe the dress rehearsal's already begun in some places.
9468 : The figurative big top that once protected you is no more. You're as naked as the day your people first set foot upon these shores.
9469 : Now that you're exposed to the elements, there's nothing to stop my little spell from raining down upon you. Its droplets will turn to buckets and then to torrents, leaving everyone you've ever held dear to drown.
9470 : Pwehehe, I can already hear your screams of terror.
9471 : They're like an encore call to my ears.
9472 : Of course, you won't enjoy it nearly as much as I will.
9473 : Oh, that's my cue. Time to exit stage right.
9474 : There is a way for you to remove the curse, though. I'll be more than happy to divulge it...if you can find me.
9475 : Now to begin this game of hide-and-seek. Ready or not, here I go!
9476 : Bwahahaha!
9477 : Fremilla? Fremilla!?
9478 : A...Arci...ela...?
9479 : I don't know what to do, %! Fremilla's not opening her eyes!
9480 : Just what have the Peacekeepers been doing this whole time, anyway!? Spit shining their bootarus!?
9481 : And, Ikhi, how could you let that magic-wagic force veiling the city get destroyed!?
9482 : Incompetentarus, the both of you. Why do we even suffer your presence in these discussions?
9483 : Are you trying to start something, furball!?
9484 : All you do is put others down to build yourself up. You don't give a damn about this city's policies unless they make you bayld!
9485 : Pffft, a weak argumentaru made by an equally weak mind.
9486 : I'm just telling it like it is. Face the truth and stop getting your britches in a bundle-wundle over it!
9487 : Rrrelax and take a deep breath, you two!
9488 : How're we supposed to be relaxed? Did you not just see that phantasm!?
9489 : Some good that Ergistupid thing is!
9490 : And what in the Goddess's name was Melvien talking about, Arciela?
9491 : Indeed. We would be most appreciative if you would tell us the truth.
9492 : Although, I am certain the whole thing is a plot by the pro-colonization faction to sully the integrity of those willing to uphold the founder king's wishes!
9493 : If you keep proposing ridiculous theories like that, Hildebert, I might actually start believing Chero-Machero's claim that you're senile.
9494 : No one asked for your opinion, conspirator! The rotten rhetoric your kind spews forth does nothing but breed lies and deception!
9495 : Such is made all the more apparent now that we know Melvien lives.
9496 : Surely my theory is far less absurd than the blatant falsehoods this girl has been feeding us--
9497 : Enough already!
9498 : Do none of you realize what just happened right in front you!?
9499 : Be adults and act your age for once!
9500 : Who cares about your stance on the colonization movement!? This is much bigger than that!
9501 : Now's the time to put aside our differences for the good of the nation!
9502 : Yet all you can do is sling mud at each other like prehistoric brutes!
9503 : Look at the big picture!
9504 : What's the purpose of our Twelve Orders?
9505 : I've always thought it was to protect the people, but apparently you think it's to grab more power for yourselves!
9506 : You completely ignore the blight in the jungle, pawning off the responsibility on pioneers.
9507 : You each take credit for the movement's victories and blame others for its failures!
9508 : I can't take any more of this useless bickering. Ruin is staring us right in the face, yet you're only looking for personal gain. Frankly, it's pathetic!
9509 : Shut your damned mouth, wench!
9510 : What would a mere child know of governing a city-state? It takes more than lofty ideals and good intentions to keep a nation functioning!
9511 : I have remained silent about your improper behavior in deference to the chancellor, but I see little reason to do so if this is how you plan to act in his stead.
9512 : Do you think your royal lineage grants you innate asylum from our skepticism!?
9513 : Anyone with half a head on their shoulders would doubt the veracity of the claims you make. A talking dragon!? A clandestine village hidden in the shadow of Mount Kamihr!? Fie, I say!
9514 : My sentimentarus exactly. I don't know how you were able to win Ikhi's respect, but I doubt even half the people here believe your cockamamie-wamie stories.
9515 : However, what Melvien said is a much more crucial-wucial subject. What do you think he needs to make preparations for?
9516 : And how'd he manage to fake his own death? Can you imagine going to that extentaru just for a prank--
9517 : D-don't think you can scare-ware me with a dirty lo--
9518 : ...What?
9519 : What're you doing, you idiotaru?
9520 : Out of the way.
9521 : He's...not breathing...
9522 : You're joking, rightaru...?
9523 : I wish I were.
9524 : No, you can't be serious-werious...
9525 : Of all the...
9526 : First that phantasm appears in the castle...
9527 : Now Chero-Machero inexplicably collapses...
9528 : And let us not forget about Melvien's return from the dead. All of this...
9529 : ...is entirely your doing!
9530 : I can see why you are sometimes called the Wildborn Witch. You definitely seem to care more about the jungle than the Sacred City.
9531 : Exactly what is your plan for engendering the downfall of our society, you evil enchantress?
9532 : Stop rrright there, white whiskers.
9533 : What's all this caterwauling for?
9534 : You're a grrrown Elvaan. Don't get so hot under the collar just because a maiden got caught up in the moment.
9535 : It's not like she has some kind of deathgaze or anything. There's no way she could send him rrreeling with a single look.
9536 : Hmph...
9537 : And you, Arciela. There's usually a time and a place for everything, but not for that phrrrasing.
9538 : Exactly. Should a riot have started, it would've been all your fault.
9539 : Stuff it, Grrratzigg! Don't add fuel to the fire!
9540 : I officially declare this meeting adjourned. Return to your respective orders and take stock of the situation there.
9541 : Arciela, I assume you erupted like that because you have been through so much recently. Perhaps a rest would do you some good.
9542 : Ugh, what a strrressful day...
9543 : %, you're prrrobably due for a catnap, too.
9544 : What!? Frrremilla!? I'm at a loss for words!
9545 : If only I could do something to help besides stand guarrrd over the castle.... Either way, there is sadly nothing you can do here at the moment.
9546 : Start from where? The beginning. Amchuchu. Everyone's angry.
9547 : Mistress Arciela refuses to take any of her meals.
9548 : No matter what tactics we employ, we simply cannot get her to leave her chambers. I fear that perhaps the best course of action is to simply leave her be.
9549 : Master...Ygnas?
9550 : %...give...heirloom...necklace.
9551 : You want me to... Give back the necklace? Do what with what?
9552 : Yes. Must...have. ...Please.
9553 : Bring...me...Adou...lin...necklace.
9554 : Those soft eyes, that round figure, those rustling leaves...he is cuteness incarnate.
9555 : Looking as woefully wretched as ever, I see.
9556 : How will you respond? Is there something you want to discuss? What brings you here?
9557 : Not with a maggot like you!
9558 : Last time I checked, I was a citizen of Adoulin. I do not believe I need Your Highness's holy permission to walk about my own city.
9559 : I heard about the princess, and I think it is plain pathetic. Where did the dignity and perseverance she showed in Kamihr Drifts go!?
9560 : Arciela should know by now that life isn't all giggles and sunshine. She needs to treat this as a test of will.
9561 : However, I understand how her emotions could get the best of her after all she's been through.
9562 : She is a young and passionate idealist, yet has been ostracized by the council members. All the while, misfortune bombards her homeland from every direction. That is enough to take the wind out of anyone's sails.
9563 : And that is where you might as well come in!
9564 : Stop being a chigoe on the wall and actually do some good for once. Show her that she is not alone in this chaos.
9565 : Make her heart burn with fervor once more!
9566 : That task will be a daunting one to complete, considering her current mental state...and that <cough> I could not <cough>.
9567 : ...
9568 : Ugh, cut me some slack! I knew you were daft, but now I have to question whether or not you are even sentient! Let me spell it out for you.
9569 : Give...Arciela...--are you following me?--something...she...likes!
9570 : Talking with you always leaves me drained. I shall be going before I catch whatever form of stupidity afflicts you.
9571 : Only one of the following can be traded. Please throw away any excess ones: %, %, %.
9572 : Ah, %. Cynthia entrrrusted me with a message for you.
9573 : It rrreads, Please bring the heirloom necklace that Master Ygnas mentioned.
9574 : I think it would be easiest if you just hand overrr the necklace to me, and I shall pass it on to Cynthia.
9575 : I await your rrreturn.
9576 : Yes, this % does look to be the keepsake they rrrequested.
9577 : Could this be the necklace you're rrreferring to, %?
9578 : A kind citizen came to turrrn this in. It's adorned with the Order of Adoulin's insignia, so I figured you'd be looking for it and took it off his hands.
9579 : Please be a bit more attentive the next time you're entrrrusted with something from then Adoulins. This is a precious heirloom, after all.
9580 : All's well that ends well, I suppose. I'll brrring the necklace to Cynthia, so you're free to do whatever you please.
9581 : Mistress Arciela requests an audience with you. I wish you all the best.
9582 : What will you say to her? ...Are you all right? Arciela...?
9583 : ...
9584 : ...After the council dispersed, reports began flooding in. Each detailed how certain people involved with the Twelve Orders had met with some grave misfortune...just like that lunatic jester predicted!
9585 : Worst of all...Tiana was one of them.
9586 : I made a promise when the World Tree was resurrected that I wouldn't cry ever again...but I've already broken it.
9587 : I'm sorry...I just couldn't take it anymore. The shock was too much for someone as weak as me...
9588 : I thought I knew the jungle inside and out, but I didn't know a single thing about it.
9589 : I can't even tell good from evil anymore, partly because there's evil in me. I said some horrible things at the assembly, but they weren't just a way of calling attention to the problem...I truly meant them.
9590 : All my life, they've called me a witch behind my back, but I've never felt it. Not until now.
9591 : Those sprites risked their lives for me, but...to tell the truth, it was all in vain. I'm not worth protecting.
9592 : Because of me...Fremilla...
9593 : %... It's only a matter of time before you fall to my curse, too. Get away while you still can.
9594 : How will you console her? You did the best you could. You're not weak in the least. This isn't the Arciela I know.
9595 : That's the thing... I didn't. All I did was foul things up.
9596 : Yes, I am. None of this would've happened if I were stronger...
9597 : Any words of encouragement? You're not alone in this. Nothing will happen to me. I think that we're all weak.
9598 : But...if you stick by me...you'll surely...
9599 : How can you be so sure?
9600 : I know I said that on Mount Kamihr, but...
9601 : ...I appreciate your kind words. Still, I...
9602 : I can't help but think that if only...
9603 : If only I'd died in the jungle back then!
9604 : .........
9605 : ...!
9606 : %...?
9607 : How will you respond? Never say that again! That's a terrible thing to say. ...Sorry.
9608 : ...What was I thinking?
9609 : I...I'm so sorry!
9610 : %, I... I...
9611 : ...I'm sorry.
9612 : Anything to add? Let's look for Balamor. It's time to go settle the score.
9613 : But...how can we believe anything that raving jester's said? Even if you find him, he might not help at all...
9614 : Your rebuttal? Doing nothing will help us even less. We're going to undo that curse!
9615 : ...I guess you're right. Plus, it's obvious that thing's involved with Melvien somehow.
9616 : We're the only ones we can trust--no, the only ones who can do anything about this.
9617 : I can't argue with that!
9618 : According to Svenja, everyone who succumbed to this curse has exhibited the same inexplicable symptoms...
9619 : Though it looks like they are dead at first glance, the Order of Janniston speculates that their souls have been removed.
9620 : While of course she didn't mention a time frame, I can't imagine people would last long in that condition.
9621 : We have to release Adoulin from this terror as soon as possible! We've not a minute to spare!
9622 : In the name of all we hold dear, I'll leave my doubts behind and dive into the heart of darkness!
9623 : ...Will you take the plunge with me, %?
9624 : What is your reply? That's the spirit! Of course.
9625 : Great!
9626 : What? A gift...?
9627 : Oh, you!
9628 : Of all the things to give me, you pick this!?
9629 : You're simply...
9630 : ...too good to me.
9631 : %, you're truly an extraordinary person. At first, I only thought it'd be funny if our paths crossed once more.
9632 : I had no idea we'd be close at all.
9633 : ...Sorry if that sounded cold. It's just that I've never been able to expect much from anyone before.
9634 : That's why I was so glad I could see you again at the banquet. Once we were reunited there, I thought that just maybe the wheels of something great had been set in motion.
9635 : I would've been more acknowledging if I weren't in front of eleven of the most important figures in the city. But now, I feel comfortable enough to say...
9636 : Thanks for all you've done for me, %.
9637 : I'm done living in fear of what could have been!
9638 : Ygnas...
9639 : Rala......sepul...cher...
9640 : Balamor...there...
9641 : He's still breathing. Goodness gracious, he always pushes himself too hard.
9642 : I know my brother could barely get across what he wanted, but it sounded like Balamor should be in the founder king's tomb within Rala Waterways.
9643 : Let's go and show him that whoever laughs last laughs loudest!
9644 : I believe the prrrincess has headed to her ancestor's grave in the waterways.
9645 : I strrrongly disagree with her going down there alone, but who am I to stop her? Keep her safe for the good of the nation, pioneer!
9646 : You were nice enough to return this to us while I was up in my room wallowing in self-pity.
9647 : You do remember it, don't you?
9648 : Heir...loom. Brimming...with...power.
9649 : Even I can see that...or sense it, anyway. A force unlike anything I have felt before now resides within this necklace.
9650 : I'm sure its new properties will prove more than useful in our upcoming battle, and there's no one else more deserving of its enhanced facets than you.
9651 : Please, I beg you to take it.
9652 : Which would you like? This is all very sudden... The %. The %. The %.
9653 : Oh, sorry about that. I don't think I could make a decision either if someone shoved them all in my face like that and told me to choose.
9654 : Take your time. You can always come back later when you've finally figured out which one best fits your needs.
9655 : I'll be waiting for you.
9656 : Have you made your decision?
9657 : %... Thank you...for...taking...care......Arci...ela.
9658 : Save...Adou...lin. Rid...land......Hades...
9659 : ...The time is upon us.
9660 : August, you misguided half-wit.
9661 : Soon, everything you struggled so long and hard to protect...
9662 : ...everyone whose soul has been consumed by darkness...
9663 : ...I will free from the shackles of fate.
9664 : And how will I achieve this feat? Why, through death, of course.
9665 : Arciela and her companion now stand upon a precipice that looks down on the world's certain doom. What horrors lurk within these bowels of darkness that Balamor called Ra'Kaznar Turris? All will be revealed as the story of these two champions of justice comes to a head.
9666 : I have specific instrrructions not to let any without proper authorization pass.
9667 : How do you react? Proper authorization? I just want to see Arciela.
9668 : The instrrructions from the twelve orders are absolute, and it's not my place to question their actions.
9669 : ...You must leave.
9670 : %! Don't go just yet.
9671 : I had to go through the official scrrript back there, but I've something for you...from the princess.
9672 : Dark days may lie ahead for Adoulin...but I've watched the prrrincess grow from babe to young woman...and know you can help her now more than any of us.
9673 : Please...we're counting on you.
9674 : Please, take a good look at the % I handed you...and stay by Arciela's side.
9675 : You may prrroceed.
9676 : Purrrmission?
9677 : There is no need of any special permission. I was made awarrre that you were coming.
9678 : Please.
9679 : %, you've come.
9680 : Just how many times have you been to this room so we could ponder our next step?
9681 : I think I've lost count...but maybe I should've tried harder to remember.
9682 : That? It's a glass of vegetable juice.
9683 : Grennith made it for me from the bunch brought in this morning.
9684 : And who do you think delivered them directly from the Civic Arboretum? Why, Chalvava herself.
9685 : Would you like a sip?
9686 : The main ingredient is, of course, Adoulinian tomatoes, but it also contains a hint of some other fruits and vegetables.
9687 : How is it?
9688 : What is your frank opinion? It's really sweet. Ugh! Eew...now I've got cooties.
9689 : %!? Are you all right!?
9690 : %...
9691 : You don't want to know what'll happen if you say I poisoned it.
9692 : How do you respond? You poisoned it. I was just playing around. <Mutter>
9693 : You're so cruel! And besides, if I poisoned it, wouldn't I be keeled over on the bed!?
9694 : <Sigh> There's no helping you, is there?
9695 : Hmm? What did you say?
9696 : What do you have to say for yourself? ...I was just playing around. Play the fool. Say nothing.
9697 : <Sigh> There's no helping you, is there?
9698 : Huh?
9699 : Wh-what are you implying!?
9700 : I h-haven't even touched the thing, other than to put it down when Grennith brought it!
9701 : I'm asking you how it tastes, not...not...!
9702 : It is, don't you think?
9703 : Though the arboretum is still small and the Inventors' Coalition still has work to do, the bounty tastes as sweet as the finest imported honey.
9704 : Young stalks brought from the forest are planted and grow, producing the food that will sustain future generations.
9705 : But the fear of the forest is deeply ingrained within Adoulin, and many still view anything originating there with trepidation.
9706 : I can only hope that in time people will begin to realize what the forest can provide us if we pay it the proper respect.
9707 : And even when I grow old, I'll never forget the taste of this juice today.
9708 : I'm glad I was here to share it with you.
9709 : <Cough> But there're other things I remember just as clearly.
9710 : Oh yes, don't think I'll let you off that easily.
9711 : I can still feel the heat of your hand...
9712 : ...When you struck me across the cheek. Though I knew there was a true sense of care and concern behind your actions.
9713 : You showed me the way.
9714 : At least, that's how I like to think of it.
9715 : Anything to say? Does it still hurt? Was I too forceful? I'm so sorry.
9716 : Yes, it still stings.
9717 : Like I fell on top of a nest of wasps!
9718 : You were.
9719 : I can't believe you would raise your hand in anger.
9720 : What would you do if I said some things can't be forgiven?
9721 : Hehe, I'm just pulling your tail.
9722 : Consider it payback!
9723 : You know, %...
9724 : I felt this strange tingling when we first met. I don't want to call it a premonition because that would be too grandiose, but...I knew something was going to happen.
9725 : You swept through Adoulin like the wind, touching all you passed by.
9726 : How do you react? Like the wind? Say nothing.
9727 : Yes, the wind.
9728 : Now I see why. The winds you brought were those of change.
9729 : I...no, all of Adoulin had stagnated.
9730 : All that appeared before us, all that was occurring in the forest...we turned our faces from it.
9731 : We never realized that Yggdrasil was dying. We never realized that the Serpentine Labyrinth was arising anew.
9732 : The old proverb mentions that there is always calm before the storm, but your winds helped us weather all that was to come.
9733 : It started out with a breeze, with leaves fluttering gently, but slowly you started pushing us forward, helping us to walk step-by-step toward the herculean tasks that lay before us.
9734 : And for that I will always be grateful.
9735 : Do you remember that conversation we had some weeks ago?
9736 : I said that even though we are all weak, we become stronger to protect those we love.
9737 : That humanity isn't strong, and oftentimes we can only hope for miracles to occur...and those miracles in turn inspire us to become greater.
9738 : I always believed that to be true.
9739 : But surely I'm not the only one.
9740 : All that live in the forest...the Naakuals, those precocious sprites, the leafkin...
9741 : And likely even those beasts who sought to impede your progress...even they...even they...
9742 : %...thank you.
9743 : You've sheltered us all. The city, the jungle...
9744 : ...me...
9745 : %...
9746 : When I look inward and think of you, I...
9747 : ...
9748 : Yes? What is it?
9749 : Lady Arciela, the heads of the twelve orders request your presence in the Great Hall to discuss a matter most urgent.
9750 : I see. I'll head there shortly, Grennith.
9751 : Thank you.
9752 : Forgive me, Arciela, but they insist that you hurry.
9753 : I haven't yet made my peace with them after those harsh words we exchanged.
9754 : The situation had taken a turn for the worse, and I could never find the time to...
9755 : ...No. I will stop making excuses.
9756 : This is yet another obstacle I must confront.
9757 : I...I don't...
9758 : ...
9759 : Hildebert, I...
9760 : Arciela... We stand before you today knowing that we have earned all the ire you threw at us.
9761 : You were in the right.
9762 : Hildebert...?
9763 : We were consumed by our struggle for power, squabbling over trivialities while the people begged for succor.
9764 : How had we fallen so far from grace, when we were once united in our goal of bringing splendor to our fair nation?
9765 : But any reason I give you would just ring hollow.
9766 : And I am more responsible for it than anyone in this hall.
9767 : When you spoke to us frankly, with a clear mind and a heart free of deceit, I turned on you as a shark sensing blood in the water.
9768 : And in my rage, I spewed such filth as cannot possibly be forgiven.
9769 : Would that I could take it back, but so doing would not mend the wounds I have inflicted.
9770 : Though it makes not the slightest onz of difference, I offer my sincerest apologies.
9771 : Arciela...I am deeply sorry.
9772 : So, uh... Hi, Arciela.
9773 : Chero-Machero?
9774 : Surely does beat-weat all, doesn't it?
9775 : ...You aren't the tiniestaru bit surprised?
9776 : Well, you're no fun.
9777 : Surely you saw the thousand rays of golden lightaru shining down a little while ago?
9778 : It was the World Tree...
9779 : The World Tree, huh?
9780 : Well, be that as it may, the light came streaming-weaming through the air, and before you know it this fool was bouncing off the walls.
9781 : And the whole time, he kept babbling-wabbling a bunch of nonsense.
9782 : I saw the true nature-wature of things!
9783 : It's not nonsense, you pea-brained idiotaru! The truth of everything lay before me like an open book!
9784 : Yeah, yeah, I'm sure Altana blessed you with a holy prophetic vision. I'll condescend to hear your little tale later, so shutaru your trap.
9785 : And if this dunderhead managed-wanaged to come to, you can figure out what happened next.
9786 : Do you mean...?
9787 : Sure do.
9788 : All those in the fair city-wity who dropped unconscious, be they of the twelve orders or not, popped right back up like nothing had happened.
9789 : Rightaru as rain!
9790 : Oh, Amchuchu... I couldn't be...more happy...
9791 : Then what happened to Tiana wasn't a dream. Oh, this is so wonderful!
9792 : Well...I apologize for getting caughtaru in the moment. I let my mouth run a little too wild. It's one of my character flaws.
9793 : A flaw? Like the way you sit there making excuses?
9794 : I know just the place to send you for rehabilitation-wation--deeeeeep within the snowy paradise of Kamihr Drifts.
9795 : Amchuchu, quitaru butting into other people's business! Can't you see I'm trying to make a heartfelt apology!?
9796 : It doesn't sound like an apology so much as smarmily weaseling your way out of responsibility-wility.
9797 : For someone so calculating-walculating you're not terribly good at putting two and two together.
9798 : Urf...
9799 : I'm sorry.
9800 : Arciela. %.
9801 : I'm not clear on some of the details, but we've all heard the gist of what happened.
9802 : You gave us the opportunity to come together as one again.
9803 : The opportunity?
9804 : G-g-good day, Arciela.
9805 : Hmph.
9806 : Vortimere...and Ingrid.
9807 : And yet another.
9808 : Heya, Princess.
9809 : Morimar!?
9810 : I had a little run-in with this lady friend of yers.
9811 : After we parted she stumbled upon me and dragged me back here. Not quite kicking and screaming, mind you, but...
9812 : At least, not then. So she drags me here and lays into me before fixing me up right in front of your higher-ups!
9813 : Who goes around doing that!?
9814 : You insufferable fools and that squalid lump of metal you call a weapon might have defeated Hades.
9815 : But whining about the twelve orders' problems with spit drooling down your collective chins makes my stomach churn!
9816 : Is hacking and cleaving the remnants of a two-bit has-been all you know how to do? Did you deign to spare even a thought for what happened next?
9817 : No. So the Merciless One had to swoop in and prevent this oldster from bleeding out on the carpets.
9818 : Show some gratitude for once!
9819 : I c-c-convinced Hildebert and the other orders of what occurred that terrible day.
9820 : Yet your a-a-absolution is not something I seek.
9821 : I have wronged you more than the others. Later, I w-w-withdrew to look at the city with fresh eyes. And I realized...
9822 : ...How terrible the m-m-mistake I made was.
9823 : What has been done cannot be undone...but I am ready to face any p-p-punishment you deem applicable under Adoulinian law, despite my status as a man of the cloth.
9824 : Yes...I must answer to laws of both the church and the state.
9825 : You have a grand b-b-benevolence to forgive Ingrid her wrongdoing...but the entire affair was my idea.
9826 : I am ready.
9827 : The intent behind our actions was immaterial, for the ends would never have justified the means.
9828 : Everyone here understands that and deeply regrets their consent, whether tacit or explicit. That's one of the reasons we're here.
9829 : Arciela, we are terribly sorry. And to you as well, %.
9830 : The other eleven orders have all signed a pact. No longerrr will we engage in faction warfare.
9831 : Well, it'll take a while for that to purrrcolate to the lower ranks, but we'll work at it.
9832 : It's a task for all of us to face.
9833 : Technically I was a proponent of colonization, but you know what? It doesn't matter much to me either way. As long as we all agree on something!
9834 : Look at you, Flaviria! Your flair for diplomacy-womacy makes me a bit ill on the inside.
9835 : Ahaha! How lovely it is to be getting along at last.
9836 : At last? How would you know? You never contributed to these meetings-weetings anyway.
9837 : Don't think for a second-wecond we'll let you off so easy from now on!
9838 : Y-yes ma'am!
9839 : Arciela, we are all prepared to accept the Order of Adoulin's leadership...your leadership.
9840 : United under your banner, under the watch of Ortharsyne...as it was back in the time of the founder king.
9841 : Please, Arciela. Lead us to prosperity.
9842 : ...I understand. Forgiveness takes time.
9843 : No, Hildebert. It's not a question of forgiveness.
9844 : I, too, am filled with regret and shame over the things I've done. To hear you say something like this...
9845 : It comes as a total shock.
9846 : Truth be told, the reason I came here today was to apologize to all of you.
9847 : No apologies are necessary.
9848 : We are the ones who did not stand strong beside you in your time of need.
9849 : No, I can't...can't...
9850 : Hearing you all say this has moved me beyond words.
9851 : Thank you for being here.
9852 : And I'm sorry for having been so brash and rude.
9853 : Arciela...
9854 : Your petition has hit the soft spot of my heart.
9855 : Then the matter is--
9856 : But I cannot accept. The Order of Adoulin has Ygnas...my brother. So it is not my place to lead.
9857 : Forgive me.
9858 : Then perhaps I should abdicate in your favor.
9859 : Huh...?
9860 : How long has it been since you've seen me like this, Arciela?
9861 : Ygnas?
9862 : Everything you've done for this nation, I've watched from afar.
9863 : You isolated yourself from the squabbling of the others and continued down the path you felt was right. A noble path, one worthy of a queen.
9864 : Of that, there can be no debate.
9865 : Ortharsyne is proof of the founder king's will. I shunned it, electing for the path of colonization instead.
9866 : Were it not for you taking it up, it would have sat gathering dust in a never-opened treasury safe.
9867 : Looking upon it now, I believe that the future had been decided at that moment.
9868 : No, Ygnas, you're taking that a bit too far...
9869 : Let's set that aside and return to the request Hildebert made of you.
9870 : I'm the one who pushed him into that decision.
9871 : You?
9872 : No one has thought of the country's greater welfare more than you, not just in words, but in actions.
9873 : No matter how simply you explained your experiences and the world you've seen, none of us here could begin to comprehend your wisdom.
9874 : A new future awaits our city, and you're the only one who can lead us there.
9875 : Should you not listen to Hildebert, then at least listen to me.
9876 : Show us what a bright future looks like.
9877 : Please.
9878 : ...I shall.
9879 : There's much I've left to learn, and I will need help along my way.
9880 : But I know I'm not alone.
9881 : All of you are here, too.
9882 : Adoulin's path is for us to decide!
9883 : I feel this decision deserves a speech with the proper gravitas.
9884 : A speech! Me!?
9885 : This is all so sudden! I need some time to--
9886 : Arciela, everyone wants to hear something that comes right from your heart.
9887 : No one expects something stuffy and formal.
9888 : Tell us your thoughts about where Adoulin's future lies.
9889 : Understood.
9890 : I first set foot in the forest out of a sense of curiosity, and learned much with every step I took.
9891 : But I would have met with nothing but dead ends were it not for the support and cooperation of many.
9892 : We have been driven apart into houses supporting and opposing colonization.
9893 : And civil debate often gave way to flaring tempers.
9894 : But none of that matters now.
9895 : What Adoulin needs more than ever are strong ties between the twelve orders.
9896 : I can't deny that the jungle has suffered more than any.
9897 : My aim is to respect the cyclical nature of the land, live in harmony with the powers guiding it, and lead the forest to the same prosperity we desire to achieve.
9898 : Just as we have our own hopes and fears, so too does the forest--a living, breathing thing as much as any of us. We must respect and revere each other.
9899 : That's how we achieve true progress.
9900 : Please, everyone, hear my plea. I can't do it alone.
9901 : Under the light of this blade and the banner of the founder king...
9902 : I vow that our union will never again be broken.
9903 : I, Arciela V. Adoulin, swear to you all...
9904 : That the dawn of a new Adoulin is at hand!
9905 : (Heh, who'd've imagined things'd fall inta place so quickly?)
9906 : (That princess sure grew up fast.)
9907 : (With this, Adoulin'll know peace at last.)
9908 : (%, our roles in this affair are at an end. Let's sneak outta here.)
9909 : Select a scene. The start. The opportunity. The apology. Ygnas. Arciela's speech. Everyone in a circle.
9910 : A pleasurrre as always, %. You've come at the perfect time.
9911 : Countless others have given you their thanks, and I have yet to do the same.
9912 : You've done me a great service not only by prrrotecting the princess, but more importantly by bringing days of peace to our troubled city. You have my deepest gratitude.
9913 : Well, I'll be! Look who's come to visit the castle!
9914 : Who're you again?
9915 : Sweet mercy, that vile clown erased so much of my memory when he plowed his way into my skull!
9916 : All my embarrassing failures, times of doubt, and everything else that would hamper my self-image...poof!
9917 : So that's why I'm now the perfect model of humility and authority. A figure that all can aspire to be!
9918 : So, %, hopefully one day you can be just as spectacular as I am!
9919 : ...Oops. I, uh...said your name, didn't I?
9920 : Ahaha! You're so fun to joke around with. How could I ever forget the face of the one who rescued me from certain death?
9921 : I've been doing a little pushing and prodding behind the scenes to procure a little something as a token of my gratitude.
9922 : I asked the twelve orders to come up with something, and what do you know--they pulled through!
9923 : Of course, far be it from me to know what would suit you best, so you can pick your favorite!
9924 : Receive which gift? I need some time to think. The %. The %. The %. The %. The %. The %. The %. The %. The %. The %. The %. The %.
9925 : Of course it'd take your pretty head some time to decide. Why, I'd be fretting for half an hour if you asked me to choose between three delectable cakes, and here I provide you with a stunning array of not three, not six, but twelve choices!
9926 : Goodness! If this were a market, all those succulent sweets would be tearing a hole in my bag! But if I could only pick one...well, I'd want to take time to ponder it, too.
9927 : But if you change your mind and decide you want a different one later, I'm sure I could arrange for that to happen...for the small price of 300,000 bayld.
9928 : Hey, I didn't make up the rules!
9929 : The lovely Fremilla is anything but greedy.
9930 : If I were making the decision, you could have all twelve! Alas, I am but a humble servant. Who is not out for personal gain.
9931 : But enough talk about my total political impotence.
9932 : I'll be totally upfront. That bayld I'll charge you? It'd go to repairing that terrible destruction that happened down in Rala Waterways. Surely you remember.
9933 : Of course, it'd be an anonymous donation. None of that Fremilla the Magnanimous or anything. How does The Erratic Maidservant sound?
9934 : Hiya, %! Have you made your decision yet?
9935 : Are you sure that's the one you want?
9936 : You certainly do have a flair for the beautiful!
9937 : Of course, Chez Fremilla has a return policy. If you decide a different trinket would better suit you, I'll exchange it for your current one and a fee of 300,000 bayld.
9938 : Let me throw in a little something extra as thanks for all the good you've done for the Sacred City of Adoulin!
9939 : Best of luck in all your travels!
9940 : See ya later!
9941 : Well met, %. Forrrgive me if I'm butting in, but did you happen to lose %?
9942 : A particularly vigilant citizen returrrned it to the castle, where I decided to hold it for safekeeping. Anything emblazoned with the Order of Adoulin's seal is too important to let out of my sight.
9943 : Please ensurrre that you do not lose it again. I would hate to picture the look on the princess's face were you to do so.
9944 : A particularly vigilant citizen returrrned it to the castle, where I decided to hold it for safekeeping.
9945 : Perhaps you wish to exchange the gift the twelve orrrders gave you for another?
9946 : Though I would love to be of service, Fremilla was insistent that you remit 300,000 bayld. Please come back again once you have procurrred the requisite amount.
9947 : It appears you have procured the requisite amount of bayld. Please select the item you desire.
9948 : The exchange will incur a fee of 300,000 bayld. I am aware the prrrice is steep, but I assure you the cause is good.
9949 : Exchange your gift? (# bayld) Yes. No.
9950 : Understood. I wish you the best of luck in your adventurrres, be they in Adoulin or elsewhere.
9951 : I shall call Fremilla immediately.
9952 : %! You're here to exchange your gift, correct?
9953 : Behind me stands the amazing-wazing residence of the one and only Chero-Machero. I shouldn't need to tell you that he's the minister of commerce, but I like to talk, so I will.
9954 : To be honestaru, he's probably too busy counting his bayldy-wayld to have an audience with you now, but come by the next time you have a business proposition.
9958 : ADSC_TMP#
9959 : tmp#
9969 : There's no way we'll get any further without more data. If only we could find someone willing to...
9970 : You there! Are you familiar with the leafkin?
9971 : They're creatures about as big as coconuts, and they wrap themselves in leaves for clothing. They're so adorable that I just want to give them a big hug!
9972 : They may not be a part of mankind, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them monsters. They aren't aggressive, and they have many fans throughout Adoulin.
9973 : The Scouts' Coalition wants to learn more about their behavioral patterns and life cycles, but we lack any credible information.
9974 : That being the case, we're looking for people willing to assist in our surveys.
9975 : Please, think of the leafkin.
9976 : How about it? Sure. Let's leaf this alone.
9977 : Dang it! Well, you know where to find me if you change your mind.
9978 : Let's get right down to business, then. Step one is to gather information in town.
9979 : I've received reports of leafkin sightings from the Couriers', Pioneers', and Peacekeepers' Coalitions.
9980 : However, we have to verify the authenticity of any information we receive if we don't want to go on a wild-goose chase.
9981 : Should you come across any promising leads, follow up on them by going to the source, and report back to me with your findings.
9982 : I suggest you get started by visiting the other coalitions I've mentioned--Couriers', Pioneers', and Peacekeepers'.
9983 : Can I help you? ...I see. Information on the leafkin-weafkin, is it?
9984 : You know, I saw something resembling a leafkin when I stopped at a frontier station in the Morimar Basaltaru Fields.
9985 : Let me take out my mappy-wap. See if that jogs my memory... ...There we go. Right here, around K-10.
9986 : 'Course, it was nightaru out, so I can't be sure...but I'd lay money that it was one of them creatures you're looking for.
9987 : Forgotaru already? That's OK. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, either. I saw a leafkin-like creature in the Morimar Basalt Fields, somewhere in the K-10 vicinity.
9988 : It was a moonless night, so my eyes could have been playing tricky-wicks on me. Best go see for yourself.
9989 : All you adventarus from the Middle Lands are keeping the coalition busy. I'm earning my paycheck, I tell you.
9990 : We'd better beef up our patrols if we hope to keep everyone safe from the trouble you lotaru are stirring up.
9991 : You're the [man/woman] who's been assisting us with the leafkin investigation? Any news?
9992 : Hmm? A rusty pioneer's pickaxe...?
9993 : You caught it while fishing in the Zoldeff River?
9994 : Now that you mention it, the Pioneers' Coalition has reported large quantities of equipment vanishing.
9995 : The leafkin are behind it, aren't they? What are they playing at, hampering the progress of our efforts?
9996 : I'll inform the Pioneers' Coalition of the situation.
9997 : The leafkin are planting seedlings? Hmm...
9998 : Well, they DO use leaves and fruit as garb. Trying to replenish the forest to fashion more garb, no doubt.
9999 : That would explain why they feel threatened by our activities in Ulbuka.
10000 : You saw a leafkin...take an umbril head-on!? I didn't think they had such gumption in their buds!
10001 : Umbrils are ancient, mysterious creatures that have nested in Ulbuka since time immemorial.
10002 : We know as little about them as we do the leafkin. Perhaps the two are natural enemies?
10003 : This is really something to ponder. We'll make sure to analyze the leafkin in light of what we've learned about the umbrils.
10004 : We might be able to use this as a foothold for further knowledge.
10005 : You've delivered us some valuable information. The coalition cannot offer much in terms of payment, but it is the thought that counts--not the size of the reward.
10006 : Come back if you learn anything more.
10007 : You've come up with far more than we could have expected. This will help our research proceed much more smoothly.
10008 : The more we learn, the more we realize we don't know. Unique creatures, indeed, these leafkin.
10009 : They must have some purpose in life that we cannot yet comprehend...
10010 : ...Pay no attention to my ramblings. A member of the Scouts' Coalition should not speak authoritatively without sufficient proof.
10011 : One day, we'll figure out what makes them tick. I'm sure you'll be interested in our findings as well.
10012 : The leafkin surely are mystifying creatures. I hope you're looking forward to what we find out about them as much as we are.
10013 : The door is firmly shut.
10014 : Hey there, Erisa. Look at the massive haul I brought in today.
10015 : That's so many! You burned down the forest, didn't you?
10016 : Why do you have to put it like that? You know I respect the sanctity of nature.
10017 : Don't be so flippant. You know what will happen if we anger the forest...
10018 : Yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before.
10019 : Until next time!
10020 : <Sigh> Always running off when he hears something he doesn't like.
10021 : Good day. Say, you wouldn't happen to be a pioneer, would you?
10022 : It's quite uncommon for one of your ilk to come this way, seeing as the Order of Renaye is opposed to your work.
10023 : Excepting, of course, that man who was just here.
10024 : I, too, am opposed to all this nonsense, but the seeds he brings back are invaluable for my research into Eastern Ulbuka.
10025 : Thanks to his efforts, I have been able to discover new species of plants that we never before knew existed.
10026 : Some of these have begun to bear fruit, and the Order has high expectations for the bounty they may provide.
10027 : There's just one problem. Just as the fruit begins to sprout, the plants stop growing. Even the % created by the Inventors' Coalition is of no help.
10028 : Just the thought of them withering on the vine terrifies me, but there is so little I can do!
10029 : Of course, if I had %, I might be able to do something about it.
10030 : Kyff once brought me a seed that had % mixed in with it.
10031 : My previous findings indicate that % contain nutrients that accelerate the growth of plants.
10032 : If I can create special fertilizer using them, then I can bring the dying plants back to life in no time at all.
10033 : I realize that it isn't my place to ask, but if you could bring me back %, I would be eternally grateful.
10034 : Kyff mentioned that he first found them on black mandragoras roaming the Yahse Hunting Grounds.
10035 : I understand if you don't want to help a complete stranger, but those root creatures are probably your best bet if you do.
10036 : Of course...it only makes sense that this special fertilizer helps these new plants to bear fruit.
10037 : The black mandragoras located in the Yahse Hunting Grounds can provide the % I need for my fertilizer. At least, that's what Erisa said.
10038 : I can't stress enough how much it would mean to us if you were able to obtain some.
10039 : Oh ho, so you got yourself ahold of %!
10040 : Erisa mentioned something about creating fertilizer from this stuff.
10041 : Where can I find Erisa?
10042 : Kyff? Who's that man with you?
10043 : Well, you see--
10044 : Enough with the formalities. Those plants you've been growing? I need 'em.
10045 : But...why?
10046 : Erisa, please. You have to trust me.
10047 : These plants are dangerous, so Ikhi Askamot has permitted us to take them.
10048 : But...my entire research revolves around studying dangerous plants. Why would these be any different?
10049 : What you really mean is that you aren't satisfied laying waste to the forest. You want to rob the precious life it has given us!
10050 : I have no time for this. Just hand over the plants.
10051 : They're in the back, right?
10052 : Yvermain, hand me the %.
10053 : Huh? Oh, right.
10054 : Graaah, where in the hell could she have put them!? The plants aren't here at all!
10055 : Where'd she take 'em? Out with it, or it'll be your hide on the line!
10056 : Sh-she said she'd take them somewhere more appropriate for fertilizing...
10057 : Where!? Tell me, now!
10058 : Th-the Civic Arboretum in the Rala Waterways...
10059 : You! Don't just stand there! If you're a pioneer like us, then it's your moral duty to help us get those plants back!
10060 : Those cursed things grow from seeds dropped by rafflesia.
10061 : As soon as they start bearing fruit, everyone around the plant will be in danger!
10062 : Listen to me very carefully. The plants you're looking for have bulky leaves with fruit covered in a hard shell. Pluck off those harvest-wrecking monstrosities.
10063 : The two of us'll head to the Peacekeepers' Coalition right away. We've got to warn them before it's too late!
10064 : We'll go to the Civic Arboretum as soon as they're ready. Now hurry!
10065 : Erisa must have gone to the Civic Arboretum to fertilize the plants.
10066 : What did that guy say? Something about bulky leaves and hard shells?
10067 : I've got to stay here and keep an eye on things. Make sure Erisa comes back in one piece!
10068 : Erisa, don't be so down. There's no way you could've known that would happen.
10069 : If only I had done what they'd asked...things would have turned out differently.
10070 : I kept telling myself that I was doing it for scientific purposes, when I was really just being selfish.
10071 : It's only natural to feel attached to something you've worked so hard for.
10072 : You're the person who came to the Waterways earlier, aren't you?
10073 : Kyff said...to give this to me?
10074 : This...this is the first thing I ever grew...
10075 : I remember...back then, even if it was just some common houseplant, I was so happy to see my charge blossom.
10076 : I see. He doesn't want me to give up on my horticulturist pursuits so easily.
10077 : I suppose he's right. If I acquiesce now, everything I have done will be for naught.
10078 : Still, everything I have done has besmirched the name of the Order of Renaye. I should have been more careful.
10079 : But Kyff gave me a new lease on life.
10080 : I've got to keep on going--starting with these seeds right here.
10081 : But he's not the only one I have to thank. You have done me a great service as well.
10082 : This is long overdue, and I apologize for my tardiness.
10083 : I only hope that you will find it an appropriate reward.
10084 : I swear, my eyes are starting to fail me after reading so many reports of pioneers falling victim to...rather unconventional traps set throughout the wilderness.
10085 : By Altana's good graces, I know that nefarious Blackthorn Coven is behind it all, but what could they possibly hope to gain by doing this...?
10086 : Break the silence? What's the Blackthorn Coven? No, it's not my place.
10087 : The Blackthorn Coven is a band of three of the cruelest enchantresses to ever assail Vana'diel.
10088 : They nest deep within the woods, performing strange rituals and subjecting all who dare enter their domain to unspeakable horrors--and such incidents have been on the rise of late.
10089 : We have a pontification of our finest exorcists scouring the land for them, but I would still exercise caution should your travels take you wealdward.
10090 : Excuse me, [good sir/fair lady]!
10091 : I'm terribly sorry to bother you out of the blue like this, but my name is Nashu. I'm also an exorcist...or at least one in training.
10092 : I couldn't help but overhear your conversation regarding the Blackthorn Coven.
10093 : To tell the truth, many veteran exorcists with a storied history of service to Altana think it would be best to leave the Coven to their own devices for the time being.
10094 : The Order of Weatherspoon is staunchly opposed to the colonization of Ulbuka, so they advocate maintaining this coincidental alliance.
10095 : I, however, cannot abide the suffering of my fellow man!
10096 : As an exorcist, it is my duty to bring the heavy hammer of justice down upon these mavens of madness, these harlots of heresy!
10097 : It certainly won't be an easy task. Ensnaring even one adept practitioner of the dark arts would fell a man, but three... To be honest, I don't think I'm skilled enough to capture them myself.
10098 : Therefore, would... Would you be so kind as to lend me a hand in this endeavor?
10099 : Lend a hand? With pleasure. To this twerp? Never.
10100 : I...I know... I shouldn't have even asked. Sorry for so blatantly overstepping my bounds.
10101 : Make sure not to be caught unawares should you venture into the weald. There is no way to tell whether we will have captured the Blackthorn Coven by the time you enter.
10102 : Y-you're that adventurer from before! Over here, over here!
10103 : You wouldn't happen to have changed your mind about....you know...the thing, would you?
10104 : I give you my undying gratitude! Before I get too excited, though, I should probably ask your name.
10105 : %, is it? Well, %, I'm utterly overjoyed to have made your acquaintance!
10106 : Getting down to business... The last confirmed sighting of the Blackthorn Coven I've heard about was in %, around what corresponds to grid J-6 on your map. That seems like as good a place as any to start looking.
10107 : Might you be %?
10108 : Nashu asked me to relay this message to you. It simply states, Meet me at J-6 in %. Whatever could be going through that boy's head?
10109 : He knows full well the Blackthorn Coven has been spotted there numerous times. Should you choose to search him out, may Altana's guiding light envelop you in its protective glow.
10110 : Good tidings to you, %.
10111 : Nashu told me all about your little adventure and how it ended in failure. I cannot say that I am surprised--the Blackthorn Coven wouldn't be the wickedest witches in the west if any wide-eyed novice could capture them.
10112 : I must say, though, the number of pioneers falling victim to traps throughout the jungle has absolutely plummeted.
10113 : Don't get any ideas. Getting involved with those harpies will only result in him--or you--getting hurt.
10114 : %! %! %!
10115 : How serendipitous of me to bump into you.
10116 : I just became privy to some most scandalous gossip. Will you please lend an ear?
10117 : Apparently those mothers of malevolence have entered into negotiations with the only clan more bloodthirsty than they...the Velkk!
10118 : These reptilian degenerates are known to waddle around the crevasses of %, indiscriminately attacking on sight all who infringe upon their territory.
10119 : They relentlessly tear their prey apart with their powerful jaws for the sheer joy of killing, and then leave the remaining shards of bone and strips of flesh to rot upon the ground. Normally, no one would ever encroach upon their settlement.
10120 : What would keep a ruthless band of murderers like the Velkk from trying to slaughter these witches--who are still technically people--with no questions asked?
10121 : Perhaps our failed attempt to capture the sorcerous trio in Yorcia Weald has come back to haunt us. Now that I mull this over, we never did hear what they wanted with % and %...
10122 : Oh, my... Could we have inadvertently aided in the coven's nefarious deeds? If so, we have to find them and stop them before I suffer a theological crisis!
10123 : Help find the coven? Of course, for Altana's sake! Um, Zaffeld told me to stay away. No, go have your theological crisis.
10124 : <Sigh> Of course. It is all my fault. When will I learn to leave the more incriminating details out of my reports?
10125 : Still, I firmly believe that my keen sense of justice will triumph over my bureaucratic shortcomings! In the name of all that is holy, %, I beseech your aid!
10126 : I...I see... My apologies for burdening you with such a request.
10127 : Getting involved with those harpies will only result in him--or you--getting hurt.
10128 : Have you decided to help me dig up what the Blackthorn Coven is planning? I am always in need of someone who has the Goddess's blessing, you know.
10129 : Thank you immensely!
10130 : The triad of terror rendezvoused with the Velkk in quadrant E-7 of %, if recent scouting reports are to be believed.
10131 : Maybe those lazy lizards are still basking in the glow of their successful negotiation. If you could head down there and put your ears to the ground, as it were, hopefully we can learn something of value.
10132 : Just make sure you don't end up six fulms under!
10133 : Nashu asked me to remind you to muster at E-7 of % before he darted off.
10134 : I tried to warn him about the foolishness of his acts, but he simply muttered something about divine retribution. Listen to me--that boy's unstable, and you'll get into nothing but trouble if you keep chasing the Blackthorn Coven.
10135 : What can the coalition do for you today, good [sir/lady]?
10136 : You say that Alianne from the Order of Janniston would like our maester to investigate something for her?
10137 : Is this some kind of joke? If Margret were to take on the work of every last citizen who wanted her aid, why...
10138 : People thirst for knowledge, Wegellion, and as the Scouts' Coalition maester, I feel a responsibility to aid our citizenry whenever I am able.
10139 : But you would have me shut the doors to one in search of answers. What say you about this particular case?
10140 : Esteemed Maester, I only mean to say that we must carefully select our battles.
10141 : Your approach is correct, indeed--but it is not your place to make decisions for me.
10142 : O-of course not, Maester.
10143 : Pray tell, what would you ask of me?
10144 : It's about that young man, then? I suppose I should not be surprised. Truth be told, I have been continuing to investigate his case.
10145 : I do not mind taking on something else related to this incident, but I have one condition.
10146 : I chanced upon a volume of great interest during my research.
10147 : It was old and worn, and the grease of a thousand fingers had smudged some parts so that it was nigh indecipherable.
10148 : However, I have an idea how to restore the work to legibility. All I would need is for you to bring me % and %.
10149 : With the time which I would have devoted to procuring those items, I can focus on finding some clue which might lead you to a cure.
10150 : But, a word of warning, if you will.
10151 : Some things...are better left unknown.
10152 : Maester Margret has pledged her support to your cause.
10153 : Bring us % and % that she might continue her pursuits.
10154 : I see you've fulfilled our maester's request.
10155 : She has found a person of interest in the case we were discussing earlier.
10156 : I see you've returned.
10157 : This Taru friend of ours is Ari-Barali. He is prone to put on airs and deliver flowers to my dear friend Svenja, and hence has some information that may be of use.
10158 : Would you mind sharing what you have learned with my acquaintance?
10159 : O-of course...
10160 : You see, every day I deliver % to Mistress Svenja...and try to suppress my accentaru so that she looks kindly on me.
10161 : O-oh! I let it slip out! Alianne is the one who always greets me, but one time, she was not there.
10162 : And so, I...well...I know I shouldn't have done this, but...
10163 : I went around back and peeked into Svenja's room.
10164 : Mistress Svenja, you cannot possibly mean to administer this medicine!?
10165 : It was derived from the %, which the pioneer brought back from Ulbuka!
10166 : Do you know what this means? If the medicine works, it will provide more fodder for those pro-colonization cronies!
10167 : We have opposed colonization from the very outset, knowing that the best way to protect our fair nation is to remain within these walls.
10168 : And this young man--was he not a pioneer? Was this disease not brought upon him by his own foolhardiness?
10169 : I, too, fear that he fell ill due to something he found in the wilds.
10170 : And worse, forging further ahead might very well lead to other, more vile sicknesses.
10171 : If that is so, Mistress, you of all people must certainly understand what we must do.
10172 : I suppose there is no helping it. Let us refrain from administering the medicine a little while and see how this plays out.
10173 : At first, I wasn't sure what they meant.
10174 : But then I realized that they were choosing not to help save a young man even though the means were right in front of them.
10175 : That one so lovely could say something so malicious...it shook me to my very core.
10176 : It took great courage for you to speak out like this.
10177 : Well, my dear pioneer, you now have something to go on.
10178 : Whether you choose to tell Alianne or not is for you alone to determine.
10179 : It is my job to provide the information, not decide what to do with it.
10180 : But remember this: a story is like a gold coin--there are always two sides.
10181 : Difficult though it is to forget Ari-Barali's sordid tale, I'll make sure word of it never leaves my lips.
10182 : My, my, my. Whatever shall I do with you, %? I hear you've been out trying to save the world from the Blackthorn Coven with Nashu again.
10183 : I swear my jaw will have to fall from its hinges before you listen to me about staying away from those vexing viragoes.
10184 : However, that's all water under Big Bridge now, for any chance you had to go plunging headfirst into thorny thickets will soon be over.
10185 : Since we've ascertained their involvement with the Velkk, Lord Vortimere has ordered some...adept landscapers to do a bit of pruning.
10186 : As I do not believe your pioneer's badge certifies you as a groundskeeper, I suggest you stick to colonization and leave the dirty work to us.
10187 : There you are, oh friend of friends! I was just about to go off and parlay with those enchantresses and thought you might want to come along.
10188 : To be honest, I still cannot fathom why anyone would ever be willing to conspire with heathens as blasphemous as the Velkk. My face turns flush with anger at the mere thought of such an atrocity.
10189 : However, the fact remains that they saved me from certain doom at Dho Gates.
10190 : Could it not be possible that their spinous exteriors are only a facade covering their silky soft hearts? Perhaps all we need to fertilize a congenial relationship with our sylvan sorceresses is to talk with them.
10191 : What do you say, %?
10192 : What do you say? How perspicacious of you. Has your brain turned to mulch!?
10193 : Whew, you cannot imagine how comforting it is to hear that someone of your prowess holds the same sentiments. My confidence has shot through the roof!
10194 : No wonder my superiors have me swabbing chamber pots instead of helping exorcise evil spirits...
10195 : Yet even a tenderfoot like me has something to offer this cloister! One could even say that I, specifically because of my inexperience, bring new blood to the family!
10196 : Therefore, I was thinking of returning to the Blackthorn Coven what they gave us in our prior adventures.
10197 : Of course, as a member loyal to the Order of Weatherspoon, my first thought was to hand it over to my superiors...but such would amount to betrayal of the people who rescued me.
10198 : Instead, I have decided to use this opportunity to meet and show them of the error of their ways. My silver tongue will convince them to consort with the Velkk no more!
10199 : Surely you will join me in my pursuit of justice, %, will you not?
10200 : Will you help? Fine, I'll go. Count me out, scout.
10201 : Oh... I see... Maybe I should stop relying on you so much. I will never learn to stand on my own two feet by constantly grasping at your coattails.
10202 : Now that we've ascertained the Blackthorn Coven's involvement with the Velkk, Lord Vortimere has ordered some...adept landscapers to do a bit of pruning.
10203 : Have you decided to help me meet our arch-nemeses?
10204 : If their past behavior is anything to go by, they will surely be skulking about Yorcia Weald! Let us rendezvous within its thickets at what corresponds to J-6 on your map.
10205 : I could barely make out what Nashu said as he rushed past like a man on a mission, but I did hear something about going to J-6 in Yorcia Weald.
10206 : How many times do I have to tell you that-- ...You know what? If you haven't learned by now, I'm not going to say anything.
10207 : It seems rrridiculous that Robertioux, of all people, could do away with an undead like that.
10208 : Yes, I could hardly believe my ears when I first heard the news. To think it was one of those ancient dullahans decked out in plate armor, too.
10209 : Even mentioning the name of those headless relics makes me think of my history lessons about the Great Expedition. If they have truly reappeared en masse, then who other than us can Adoulin call upon to save it?
10210 : Our days of sitting idly by watching pioneers pilfer all the prrrestige will finally be over.
10211 : Hopefully the age of exorcists has come at last, and hats off to Robertioux if it is so.
10212 : ...<Sigh> Altana damn that stupid Elvaan.
10213 : Jeepers creepers, I didn't know a pioneer was watching me!
10214 : Sorry, I shouldn't be speaking ill of my cohorts while others are within earshot.
10215 : Yes, I work alongside the overnight sensation that is Robertioux.
10216 : His fifteen minutes of fame have to be up soon, though. I mean, how could someone as bumbling and bland as he possibly survive the scrutiny of the public eye?
10217 : And yet, there he is, placed on a pedestal higher than the heavens. I'm envious of his situation, to say the least.
10218 : I know it's the socially acceptable thing to be proud of your colleague's accomplishments, but...but...it's Robertioux.
10219 : If he gets to be called a genius, then I deserve to be called the oracle of the Adoulin islands! Robertioux's neither the hero Adoulin wants, nor the one it needs.
10220 : Come to think of it, for a wimpy birdbrain like him to get any kind of praise, he must've been secretly training from sunset to sunrise.
10221 : If only I could find out what sort of regimen he used, then maybe my day would come as well...
10222 : ...Aha, perfect! I believe the Scouts' Coalition is going to write an article about his exploits.
10223 : Would you mind asking someone there what they were able to dig up on him?
10224 : Mind asking? Not a bit. You're a big girl; do it yourself.
10225 : But if I ask, they'll think me a copycat! I can't have that!
10226 : Pleeease? When have I ever asked you for a favor?
10227 : Thanks so much! By the way, my name's Erfimia. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
10228 : I didn't ask for your name, but if you really want me to know it...thanks again, %.
10229 : Alright, I'll see you when you're done doing my bidding. I've got to start preparing for how to receive all the accolades I'll get after learning Robertioux's secret.
10230 : I heard the Scouts' Coalition is wrrriting a piece on Robertioux.
10231 : That is simply wonderful! I cannot recall the last time that one of us Weatherspoon members was featured in any publication.
10232 : Hmmm? An article on an Elvaan named Robertioux?
10233 : ...Oh yes, that flavor of the month who seems to be on the tip of everyone's tongue recently. Reepi-Molpi, you've a visitor!
10234 : A visitaru? Tell 'em to scram-wam.
10235 : This upstanding [gentleman/gentlewoman] is quite determined to ask you a few things about Robertioux.
10236 : Pffft, I'm the one who'd like to ask-wask a few things.
10237 : That bastid won't give me a second of his time despite the fact that even the Ordah of Weathahspoon--the most uptightaru group of fogies you've evah seen--gave their permission!
10238 : He's got some twisted sense of modesty. Ev'ry time I ask fah a word or two, he always gives the same-wame reply: I am hardly a worthy subject for your prose.
10239 : You'd think he'd know bettah. If he'd just oblige me, I could cast his ordah in a much prettiah lightaru than it is now.
10240 : Eithah way, I've got bupkis-wupkis on him.
10241 : ...Except fah the factaru that he was spotted explorin' Yorcia Weald befoah givin' that undead the ol' one-two.
10242 : Maybe someone somewheahs in the vicinity-winity of Yorcia Weald's frontieah station would know somethin'.
10243 : Gettin' to the weald ain't gonna be a picnic in the pahk, though. Ugh, even the Blackthohn Coven would be easiah to intaruview than Robertioux.
10244 : Stop the press-wesses! What if you went with me? Nary a Naakual could stand in our way.
10245 : 'Sco, 'sco, 'sco!
10246 : Reepi-Molpi? He ventured off towards Yorcia Weald.
10247 : As grizzled an outdoorsman as he sounds, I fear for his safety. Would you mind checking up on him?
10248 : Hear ye, fiends from dimensions unknown! With my arrival, the clouds shall part and Altana's holy light shall bathe thee in Her purifying radiance.
10249 : Returnest from whence thou came, vile demons!
10250 : ...Oh, %! What do you think of my performance?
10251 : What do you think? I was completely captivated! It's a total yawn.
10252 : And who wouldn't be? I pulled that line right from one of the most hallowed novels on exorcism ever to be penned: Ergo Expulsion.
10253 : You have terrible taste, %. How could you yawn at one of the most famous lines in one of the most famous novels on exorcism: Ergo Expulsion?
10254 : I guess you're what Lord Vortimere terms a philistine.
10255 : Back to business, though. What did you learn about Robertioux?
10256 : Does he swallow ten % whole before running a hundred laps upon the surface of Fontis Xanira?
10257 : He...exorcised an Ahriman? In Yorcia Weald? That's rather...ordinary.
10258 : ...Huh. Could it be that perhaps slow and steady wins the race, and solid fundamentals are more helpful than feats of perceived divinity?
10259 : This has given me much to ponder. Thanks for opening my eyes to this perspective, %. In return, you can have this.
10260 : To think I'd been looking at this issue wrong the whole time.
10261 : One doesn't simply improve without grasping the basics. And how could I ever hope to usurp Robertioux's fame if I only copy him!?
10262 : I've gotta do things my own way, at my own pace, and conquer my own inadequacies! In fact, why don't I get started on my own personal training regime right now?
10263 : Returnest from whence thou came, vile demons!
10264 : The streets are abuzz with Robertioux's latest exploits. First an exorcism, then an undead vanquishing...the man's out prrrotecting our fair city while the Pioneers' Coalition lackeys flip through raunchy periodicals on the chamber pot.
10265 : I would dare say that he aims to become a high exorcist himself. Oh, to see the look on Ingrid's face when...
10266 : Oh, %! How long has it been?
10267 : Have you seen the article the Scouts' Coalition penned on Robertioux?
10268 : A glimpse into the work of the famed Robertioux, mere moments before banishing a vile skeleton from the land!
10269 : Even Ingrid herself blushes before his divine prowess!
10270 : To think--me, following in the footsteps of one so grand!
10271 : I vow that one day those reporters will be doodling the name Erfimia in their notebooks.
10272 : What better first step than to venture to the site of his latest banishing? And who better to accompany me than you, %?
10273 : Will you assist Erfimia? Of course. Why me?
10274 : This'll be a day to remember!
10275 : Laymen often throw the word undead around without fully understanding it. The term encompasses the unliving as a whole, but there are many different types. Some are demons, others unholy spirits...yet there are also those who remain tethered to this world owing to some unfulfilled promise or deep-seated regret.
10276 : And if something manifested itself there once, it's highly likely it'll do so again!
10277 : Why, what if the banished fiend were to make a reappearance? Surely you don't expect an inexperienced one such as myself to hold my own!
10278 : And if something manifested itself there once, it's highly likely it'll do so again!
10279 : This article says that Robertioux quelled the abomination in Yorcia Weald, somewhere around J-8.
10280 : Even though Rrrobertioux vanquished the immediate threat, Yorcia Weald is no place to let your guard down. Stay safe.
10281 : Araustoix has assembled a twenty-strong force of exorcists to banish the Blackthorn Coven once and for all. Good riddance, I say.
10282 : Our brothers and sisters advance on the Velkk stronghold even as we speak. Hurry to Marjami Ravine, %, and join the call to arms!
10283 : Your aid would be invaluable in stopping their further incursion against us. We're counting on you!
10284 : Well met, %!
10285 : I must extend my thanks for your valiant service to our order--no, to all of Adoulin.
10286 : I was hoping you would stop by the priory.
10287 : Nashu has been looking for you as well. To tell you the truth, I didn't think that he had it in him.
10288 : There's no denying it--with these events he's grown into a full-fledged exorcist of the Order of Weatherspoon.
10289 : Hah, and look who walks in--
10290 : %! Have you seen Soraa and the others?
10291 : They've disappeared from the hospital without a trace.
10292 : I see... Then I guess I was too late.
10293 : I did find two of these on the desk in their room. Maybe...maybe this was their way of saying goodbye.
10294 : It's a shame. Just when it seemed we could be...friends.
10295 : I think one of these was meant for you. Here.
10296 : From now on, chances are you won't be seeing much of me, either.
10297 : As a proper exorcist, my first year will be spent on pilgrimage across the archipelago's sacred sites, while getting the laws and edicts hammered into my head.
10298 : They say the first year is the hardest. It's a road all exorcists must travel, but I'm still more than a little nervous.
10299 : I owe you one, %.
10300 : You're the only reason I could become a proper exorcist in the first place.
10301 : If it weren't for you, I'd still be on kitchen duty or scrubbing the dormitory floors.
10302 : I figure the only way I can thank you properly is to work my rear off until I can be self-reliant.
10303 : Thanks, %. You've really saved my life, in more ways than one. Until we meet again!
10304 : I remember my first year as an exorcist. Those were dark days... Ugh, no more remembering.
10305 : Hail, %! You've come at just the right time.
10306 : Nashu said that if I ever saw you, I should give you this %. He said he found it somewhere.
10307 : That guy... He snuck out to bring it here right in the middle of his meditation retreat. Breaking retreat is a zero-tolerance offense here at the priory. He's now confined to his quarters for who knows how long.
10308 : I guess he hasn't changed that much after all. Still, I can't help but feel a little sorry for him.
10309 : What? You want to get him out of confinement?
10310 : Well...I don't think it'd be impossible with the right...incentive.
10311 : What do you say? (current bayld: #) How does 10,000 bayld sound? That's too bad.
10312 : Whoa, there! This certainly changes things. With such a generous contribution, I'm sure Nashu will be back in retreat in no time.
10313 : Ah! I almost forgot, here's that % I kept for you. Hang on to it.
10314 : Whoa! With this sum I'm sure...wait, this isn't 10,000. Hah! You almost had me there, %!
10315 : It is indeed. Don't get me wrong though, I'd like to help him out if I could. It's just that these sorts of negotiations can be...expensive, you know.
10316 : Nashu is confined to quarters for sneaking out during meditation with the % he found.
10317 : With a little...incentive, I might be able to get him out of there.
10318 : Did you hear? To think--after all his endless days toiling, Robertioux is finally to be made high exorcist!
10319 : It was only a matter of time with that one. How many years has it been since the last conferment ceremony?
10320 : I only wish my rank afforded me the honor of witnessing it myself.
10321 : Rrrats! Why is it that only the high exorcists are allowed to attend?
10322 : Oh! Are you looking for Erfimia?
10323 : Hehe, it's my job to be currrious. Besides, you're always talking to her out here.
10324 : Lately she's been locking herself up in Celennia Memorial Library. Her nose has always been burrried in some book or other, but lately she's been taking out so many books that the staff has issued a formal complaint!
10325 : I'm a little worrried, actually. If you're headed back down there, would you mind checking in on her?
10326 : Erfimia's been cooped up in Celennia Memorial Library for days. I hope she's still eating.
10327 : A shame to hear that Robertioux turrrned down the title of high exorcist.
10328 : What a waste. I would have accepted in the blink of an eye.
10329 : Have you seen Robertioux, lately?
10330 : Hardly. He seems to have all but disappeared from the public eye. I wonder what could have brought about such a sudden change in demeanor.
10331 : Oh? And who might you be looking forrr?
10332 : Aha... I see now. So you lost the % that Erfimia gave you?
10333 : So that explains why she applied for a new one not long ago.
10334 : You know, outsider, % are given to full exorcists as part of their confirmation. They aren't some common arrrticle you can find anywhere.
10335 : I thought it was strrrange that a girl as diligent as Erfimia would ever lose such a precious item.
10336 : And yet...here you've gone ahead and lost it forrr her, it would seem.
10337 : But...you're in luck! You see, a % just so happens to have turned up in our lost articles office. I told you, I know everrrything!
10338 : Not many exorcists worth their salt would ever lose theirs, so I'd wager that % is yourrrs.
10339 : Normally we would never hand the priory's property off to an outsider, so I reckon Erfimia must have had a verrry good reason in your case.
10340 : I'll tell you what, in exchange for a generrrous donation to the priory, I'll let you keep it.
10341 : Fantastic! Your donation will help us a grrreat deal, I'm sure!
10342 : That would be fantastic! Huh? Uh...you seem to be a little shorrrt on bayld, but...thanks for the thought.
10343 : Really? I'm sure Erfimia would be heartbroken if she ever found out you lost her prrrecious %...
10344 : With the rrright donation I'll make sure that she never finds out...and you get your % back!
10345 : Whew, my mouth's so dry it's turning to sand...
10346 : You know what would really whet the old appetite on a scorcher like this? %!
10347 : From my experience, % taste even better when kindly purchased by a selfless adventurer from the Middle Lands. Yup, compassion is truly the most effective flavoring around.
10348 : Wow, all this talk has made me even thirstier. It's like my whole body's withering from drought.
10349 : There's no way I can discuss all that clandestine information only privileged people get to hear with my throat this dry. % from the caf, however, might make me loosen my lips.
10350 : What? For me? I'm so sorry! I feel like I've coerced you into buying this for me. Feel being the operative word here.
10351 : Alright, you're definitely the [man/woman] I've been searching for! See, I'm a journalist working over in Western Adoulin.
10352 : I'm busy getting the latest scoops from around the city even as we speak.
10353 : Eastern Adoulin's the best place for that, too, since there are so many opulent and influential personages around. All I have to do is lend them an ear and I get all I need to know.
10354 : Although, not being as...financially stable as my interviewees, I'm forced to act like some ne'er-do-well and participate from the fringe. Act being the operative word here.
10355 : Luckily, my constant efforts have been handsomely rewarded with the juiciest tidbit I've plucked in a while.
10356 : It went a little something like this: We want you to collect intelligence pertaining to the formation of contemporary Adoulin. Now, this is a highly classified mission, so we can't have people eavesd--
10357 : <Ahem> You get the idea. Anyway, the reward's an astounding # bayld! This might be the first scoop I've uncovered without having to embellish anything! I'd look like a shame to the profession if I passed on this job. Look like being the operative phrase here.
10358 : Then, at this most important of times, you emerge from the mists of anonymity and appear before me. Is this serendipity? Fate? Nay...
10359 : Necessity!
10360 : The Goddess smiled upon me and sent this % to bear witness to the history we'd forge together!
10361 : To summarize the who, what, where, when, why, and how of it all...
10362 : I invest you with the power to carry out this most meaningful of assignments!
10363 : ...I said that you get to carry out this mission!
10364 : How's that sound? Like the story of a lifetime?
10365 : Well, does it? Of course! Of course not! I dunno... Could you repeat that?
10366 : My journalist's instincts told me this wouldn't go as planned. As planned being the operative phrase here.
10367 : Have you realized the scale of this assignment yet? Have I finally awakened your journalist's instincts?
10368 : Ugh, I knew this wouldn't go as...wait, you'll do it!?
10369 : Okay, then. Time to delegate duties. You'll gather the necessary details and I'll write the story. It'll be a three-legged race to the finish line!
10370 : To review, I need stuff pertaining to the formation of Adoulin as the Sacred City, so...there should be some facts lying in wait around Adoulin.
10371 : Maybe the Yahse Hunting Grounds and Ceizak Battlegrounds hide some important clues, too...? I don't know, I'm just grasping at chocobo feathers here.
10372 : I'll take whatever you find and craft from it the most eye-catching piece this continent has ever read! Eye-catching being the operative word here.
10373 : Now, get cracking! This information isn't going to dig itself up.
10374 : So, what marvels have you brought me?
10375 : Hmmm...
10376 : This might make for a mildly entertaining read, but nothing eye-catching. I'll need some more information.
10377 : With my authorial prowess, we just might be able to make something of these. Let's get started!
10378 : First, what about this %? It looks important, doesn't it?
10379 : Does it look important? Oh, it does. Not particularly.
10380 : Alright then, next up is...
10381 : This thing! I guess it's %. This looks important, too, right?
10382 : Phew, I'm glad that's finished. Now be prepared to have your mind melt in amazement of my summarization skills!
10383 : What a discovery! We've determined that nothing important ever happened in the history of Ulbuka. Case closed.
10384 : What're you thinking!? If that's all we have to report, our client's going to annihilate us in a fit of rage! Annihilate being the operative word here! Let me read through these anyway and you try to pick out what sounds important.
10385 : Two hundred years ago, all activity related to the colonization of the continent was suspended indefinitely. The populace retreated behind Jorius Yett and the city shifted its economic focus to mercantilism.
10386 : Adoulin's glory had completely vanished one hundred years after the suspension of pioneer activity. Coffers now depleted from the continued support of a system that was eventually banned, the city's military might was insufficient to assert influence over even the tiniest of nations.
10387 : Taking these issues to heart, a majority of the Twelve Orders came forth and proposed the abolition of imperial rule. The royal family capitulated to their request and abdicated in favor of a council composed of leaders from the orders.
10388 : It supposedly took much longer than expected to establish safe and reliable trade routes due to the intensity of the currents in Ulbuka's surrounding seas. The owner of this chart was also apparently bound for the Tavnazian Marquisate.
10389 : The mother of Adoulin, Maester Svenja's countenance is without imperfection. Her kind gaze emanates warmth and light that embraces all in loving affection.
10390 : Following the king's abdication, a body politic formed from leaders of the Twelve Orders was established and the Sacred City of Adoulin was born.
10391 : That should do it, I think. How about you? There anything that'll nab us heretofore unfathomable riches? Heretofore unfathomable being the operative phrase here.
10392 : Anything of value? I think so. Not at all.
10393 : Alright, then let me send this off via the Couriers' Coalition. Now all we have to do is find out the identity of our client...
10394 : But who cares who he is, as long as we get paid!
10395 : As for your share of the bayld...take this for now. The rest should come in a day or so.
10396 : Never once in all my years did I bother to investigate the history behind this continent, but it turns out there are actually some events that pique my interest. Some being the operative word here.
10397 : But my pockets are overflowing with bayld! Some seems to fall out with each step I take. This is definitely a problem I could get used to.
10398 : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know you like to think you contributed to the report as well. About that...
10399 : After paying off all the debts I owed around town, I only have so much left. This is all that's physically possible for me to part with. Physically possible being the operative phrase here.
10400 : I'll get you the rest eventually, I swear! You know I'm good for it.
10401 : But my emotions have dried up even faster. I've not a drop of sympathy left to spare for people who don't go by the name Roskin.
10402 : Ack! Um, about your portion of the reward...I kind of lost it in one of the games held by the Mummers' Coalition.
10403 : The reward also turned out to be much smaller than we expected, so...that's how the trail cookie crumbles.
10404 : ...Okay, okay, okay! Why don't I draw on my infinite stores of largesse and give you half the bayld I have on hand out of the kindness of my heart? Largesse being the operative word here.
10405 : My grandfather's grandfather had a pioneering spirit at least the match of any of the pioneering heroes of old. His career, however, was ill-fated...
10406 : You see, all activities related to colonization were banned at the time. His devotion knew no bounds, though, so he went into the jungle all by himself despite his family's pleas to put down the pickaxe.
10407 : If memory serves me, he headed for...the Ceizak Battlegrounds. Sadly, no one ever heard from him again after he left.
10408 : Our family has been opposed to colonization ever since. For me, I just don't want anyone to experience the terrible pain my ancestors did.
10409 : All the young'uns these days are wetting themselves at the mere mention of pioneering... <Sigh> I really must be getting too old.
10410 : You want to know about the formation of Adoulin? Ummm...sorry, but I don't really know anything about it. I bet the Scouts' Coalition would, though.
10411 : Whoa, that's some ancient stuff you're trying to dredge up, there. The various coalitions around here would be much more knowledgeable about that kind of stuff than me.
10412 : If you're looking for information about the old pioneering days, that guy recruiting for the Pioneers' Coalition probably knows a lot more than me...
10413 : The seas have been quite rough as of late. I cannot imagine anyone making their way to the Yahse Hunting Grounds via ship without the help of a map to delineate the currents.
10414 : Of course, our white cap-hardened captain is more knowledgeable about these waters than everyone on the continent. Do not forget to thank him for his lifesaving expertise should you seek passage on his vessel.
10415 : Oh, Maester Svenja, how I yearn to be swept up in your toned-yet-lithe arms and lose myself in your deep, calming gaze...
10416 : Oh, th-the Scouts' Coalition...? S-since we're experts at stealth, we can do wh-whatever we want wh-wherever we want! In dark alleys, in other p-people's homes...bweheheh!
10417 : Oh, pardon me. You're searching for records on Adoulin's founding?
10418 : I believe your best bet would be to flip through some of our historical primers.
10419 : They're all on that shelf over there. You can have one, but we kindly ask you to refrain from taking any more with you.
10420 : All the documents we've compiled in the coalition are for public use. Search 'til your fingers are covered in paper cuts if you want.
10421 : Compendiums relating to Adoulin's myriad historical events line the shelf.
10422 : Daily reports from coalition members are scattered carelessly about, yet are written in a surprisingly refined hand.
10424 : It keeps us dry going from east to west, We know that, among walkways, it's the best, Iiit's Biiig Briiidge!
10425 : Now the times have changed, And so have you. Let's not leave Big Bridge behind. Let's build it anew!
10426 : I've heard all about the gossip. People are saying the curse of the founder king is true and that the colonization effort is doomed!
10427 : Even Ygnas S. Adoulin has disappeared from sight, and he's the one who advocated pioneering in the first place! This does not bode well...
10428 : Eastern Adoulin is chockablock full of arrogant nobles and their inflated senses of self-worth. Be careful when approaching them, for even the most trivial perceived slight will set them off on a tirade belittling your woeful lack of civility.
10429 : They're also the reason the Peacekeepers' Coalition was erected here. They act as if pedigree equals privilege and want someone to protect their historic structures of cultural import from us filthy vermin at all times.
10430 : We, the Peacekeepers' Coalition, are here to serve and protect the citizens of Adoulin! Outsiders like you wouldn't know the first thing about how to keep Adoulin safe from...well...the outside!
10431 : This fine edifice houses what's known as the Peacekeepers' Coalition. I'll let your imagination run wild trying to figure out what our particular group does.
10432 : I know you're from the Middle Lands, but don't go being all buddy-buddy with the Pioneers' Coalition. The tangled webs they weave have ensnared many.
10433 : Welcome to Le Caf des Larmes. I cannot say that I enjoy gazing upon the vellication of your muscleless physique, but as the heir to this fine establishment, I will not refuse you service.
10434 : I cannot say I enjoy the grotesque nature of your deformed countenance, but as the heir to this fine establishment, I will not refuse you service.
10435 : Take a look at all the food we have to offer. It can only be found here in Adoulin!
10436 : Grrr...<stare>... ([He's/She's] not a merrrchant...)
10437 : Hm? You're an adventurer? Then scurry on over to the Pioneers' Coalition before I grab you by the scrrruff and carry you to Western Adoulin myself!
10438 : Oho, a sojourner come to experience the wonders of our fine city, are you? Eastern Adoulin surpasses even your wildest expectations for this mysterious continent, does it not?
10439 : I can say with certainty that our side of the city is vastly more dignified than the plebian slum... That is where the Pioneers' Coalition resides, however, so you'll have to brave the filth if you wish to register for the colonization effort.
10440 : This's Mawgwet's house. She's the maestah of the Scouts' Cowawition.
10441 : It doesn't wook wike she wants you heeah, so go away. Only I can be her appwentice!
10442 : It takes a certain type of genius to sketch a jungle landscape.
10443 : That's why I must focus all my creative energy into a dense ball of concentration. I need my muse to descend from the heavens and set my spirit on fire with a volcanic eruption of inspiration!
10444 : How does a tranquil moment spent amidst the soothing chirps of small birds and the rhythmic crash of waves upon the shoreline sound? This caf can provide you with all that and more, [my good sir/my fair lady].
10445 : Mainland Adoulin not only has sheer cliffs that rise high above the ocean, but the city itself is nestled quietly behind Jorius Yett--that enormous gate to the west.
10446 : This veritable fortress of nature is further protected by Western Adoulin, which--fortunately for us--would take the brunt of any attacks that might actually penetrate the city.
10447 : That means many unique buildings from antiquity have survived to this day. Should you have some spare time, I recommend taking a stroll and getting a good look for yourself.
10448 : Stroll northwards and you shall meet with a wharf that docks ferries bound for the Yahse Hunting Grounds.
10449 : Hahaha, your concern about sea monsters wreaking havoc on Adoulin is certainly a logical one to have. I myself consider the Peacekeepers no more than jesters dressed in steel rather than motley.
10450 : Yet, praise be to Altana, such a dreadful event has yet to occur.
10451 : You're on the hunt for a fleshless sort of prrrey? Well, our ears, eyes, and noses are the best in the reconnaissance business! That's why we're the Scouts' Coalition.
10452 : Hmmm... My sources tell me that the inforrrmation you seek can be obtained at the Pioneers' Coalition in Western Adoulin.
10453 : What's more imporrrtant than gil or bayld? Information! Looking for some facts to sink your teeth into or grab your arrrchnemesis by the throat with? Then step inside the Scouts' Coalition!
10454 : This abode is where Gratzigg, the Peacekeepers' Coalition maester, sleeps his nights away when he's not slaving over his desk.
10455 : Gratzigg thoroughly loathes pioneers with his heart and soul. Rumors have it that he even sprinkles his breakfast with flakes of skin from the remains of pioneers he's cornered in alleyways.
10456 : There's a large system of tunnels under this city called the Rala Waterways.
10457 : Almost everyone who's been down there talks about hearing grotesque howls deep within. Some have even seen monsters, they say. Maybe they slip through secret holes to get around the magic barrier...I don't know.
10458 : I'm Ysadel, a member of the Order of Adoulin. My charge is to provide assistance to pioneers in any way possible.
10459 : My apologies, but I'm afraid I can't help you if you aren't a pioneer. It's some council decision, so it all goes over my head.
10460 : I can, however, point you in the direction of the Pioneers' Coalition. Just cross Big Bridge into Western Adoulin and you can't miss it. They should be able to provide the preliminary aid you require.
10461 : Have you had the chance to venture down into the Rala Waterways?
10462 : One of my acquaintances works in the Civic Arboretum there. Should you ever tire of culling the monstrosities that lurk down there, please say hi for me.
10463 : You're about to board a ferry bound for the Yahse Hunting Grounds. This ain't some noble's backyard, though. Many a good man has died right off the boat there, so make sure you're prepared before you board.
10464 : Set sail for the Yahse Hunting Grounds? Aye aye, Cap'n! Let me test the waters more.
10465 : A wharf be lying beyond here, but the vessel ain't quite ready yet. Amazing what one sea monster can do to a ship that size, I swear. It'll probably be fit to sail once you register with the Pioneers' Coalition, though.
10466 : Prepare yourself, your family, and even your imaginary companions for life in the jungle with our latest wares!
10467 : Get lost, commoner.
10468 : ...Welcome to the Silver Knife.
10469 : Once you prove yourself worthy of privileged treatment, then we will treat you with privilege. Until then, scram.
10470 : ...You may enter.
10471 : Enter the premises? Of course, it's my right. No, it's not worth my attention.
10472 : Leave the premises? Indeed I shall. I still have business here.
10473 : The Celennia Memorial Library contains relics of knowledge from ages past as well as the latest-watest illuminated publications. We can't grantaru access to unproven philistines, however. Sorry.
10474 : The Celennia Memorial Library contains relics of knowledge from ages past as well as the latest-watest illuminated publications. Would you care to enter this vastaru vault of knowledge?
10475 : Enter the library? Yes. No.
10476 : There shall be no stowing away while I'm on watch! Only registered pioneers are allowed aboard this vessel, you imposter!
10477 : The vessel that docks beyond here transports pioneers and laymen alike to their very own island plot containing various amenities.
10478 : What do you want to know about? Nothing. Send me to my Mog Garden! Visiting others' Mog Gardens. Rent-a-Rooms. Mog Gardens. Mog Garden expansion.
10479 : I'm sure you can recall the Rent-a-Room you used back in the Middle Lands.
10480 : The ones here function in the exact same manner as the ones you've already grown to love as your homes-away-from-home.
10481 : In addition to Rent-a-Rooms, we are also working to provide pioneers with Mog Gardens.
10482 : I hate to burst your proverbial bubble, but we have yet to receive permission from the council to open them to the pioneering public.
10483 : Mog Gardens are special areas located on the islands dotting the Adoulin Archipelago which have a variety of facilities suited for all your gathering needs.
10484 : Absolutely no fee is required to take advantage of this service.
10485 : We hope that you utilize your Mog Garden to the fullest.
10486 : Your Mog Garden is now more luxurious than ever, thanks to the edification of the Pioneers' Coalition!
10487 : If your garden's services can expand, they can decrease, right? Not so! You never have to worry about losing what's already part of your Mog Garden, even if the Pioneers' Coalition should fall on hard times!
10488 : You can visit the Mog Gardens of the following party members. Is there anyone's in particular you want to visit?
10489 : Visit whose Mog Garden? No one's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's.
10490 : Okay, then. Right this way, please.
10491 : Sorry, but none of your party members have their Mog Gardens open to anyone at this time.
10492 : You are currently unable to visit that person's Mog Garden.
10493 : Listenlistenlisten! I saw a black beastie hopping from roof to roof!
10494 : I wanna catch it and talk to it! Do you think monsters can talk? What would they say if they could? Do you think they even like Humes?
10495 : You're damn right this estate belongs to an important person! Just look, it's purrrched upon a hill that overlooks Eastern Adoulin!
10496 : This grrrand abode is actually the home of Ikhi Askamot, our minister of education. She's famous not only for her political role, but also because many claim she's the rrreincarnation of legendary geomancer Sih Renaye.
10497 : Most of Adoulin's well-to-do purchase residences on the top of this hill.
10498 : I assume it's so they can actualize the metaphor of looking down on the peasantry, but maybe some just do it for the view. There have to be at least a few magnanimous nobles here...right?
10499 : I saw someone slinking through the alleyways the other night. I could only describe him as a shady gent.
10500 : Odd, I know. When I asked my superior about it, he told me people have spotted a guy fitting that description for years!
10501 : I h-h-hope it's not a ghost! I'm d-d-deathly afraid of ghosts! I can barely take a step without getting Galkabumps anymore.
10502 : This hotel's staff is the absolute paragon of hospitality, I must say. What's more, the architecture and interior design surpass even the most opulent facilities I've previously had the pleasure of visiting.
10503 : The only downside to surrounding oneself in such luxury is that it depletes your life savings. With not a gil to my name, I must prowl the streets like a common beggar in search of suitable employment.
10504 : I tried getting an interview with the former royal family at Castle Adoulin, but they turned me down at the gates! Don't they understand that inquiring minds are desperate to know more about this historical household!?
10505 : Oh well, at least I've been able to snatch up pieces of gossip around town. Maybe I can use that as a pretense to bag myself a rich broad. Heh heh.
10506 : What is it? I haven't the time to dawdle, you know. I'm meeting with some affluent merchants very soon.
10507 : We're going to discuss what needs must be met after the colonization effort has had some time to develop. The faster we read trends, the more money we'll make! Bwahaha!
10508 : All big dreams start as small seeds. Plant some of our seeds and watch your own dreams grow!
10509 : Ugh, did you come here for the express purpose of ruining my vacation!?
10510 : If I'd have known just how loud you pioneers squawked, I'd be at my other house in the Far East instead!
10511 : Welcome to Adoulin, mon [ami/amie]! Have you some business with moi this day?
10512 : I just bumped into this strange fellow a few days ago. He said he came from a place called the Middle Lands.
10513 : Could he possibly be the accomplished technician all the ladies around town are gossiping about? I believe they said his name was...Cid? No, that doesn't sound quite right...
10514 : I made a fortune here in Ulbuka, so I decided to spend a little extra and dine at this restaurant everyone was praising.
10515 : Much to my dismay, the food was atrocious, the atmosphere abysmal, and I could barely understand anything the chef said!
10516 : I'll have to get started on my next venture to rid myself of the bad taste that place left in my mouth.
10517 : Know you the Silver Knife, [Sir/Madame] Pioneer?
10518 : It is a special club which only those born with a silver spoon in their mouths may enter--I don't know why Knife, though. Sadly, even as a member of the Elvaan race, I lack the upbringing to gain access to the wonders within its walls.
10519 : This impressive estataru belongs to Melvien de Malecroix, the minister of finance.
10520 : Despite fierce opposition from many in Adoulin, he convinced the council to move forward with the colonization effort. The only reason-weason you're able to stay here is because of him, so he deserves your utmost respect.
10521 : But now...none of us will ever see him again. The horrors-worrors of the jungle know no bounds!
10522 : I had always longed to become an exorcist at this priory. Ever since I was but a babe suckling on my mother's teat, I knew that this was my calling.
10523 : And I finally realized that dream recently! I have been completely absorbed in my training. No evil spirits will be spraying our citizenry with pea soup, not while I'm around!
10524 : You may have already heard this during your travels, but there was an incident at the Wake of the Lilies over in the Middle Lands not so long ago.
10525 : I can already picture the day evil spirits will descend upon this city en masse and suck the souls from the living, occupying their hollowed bodies and roaming the landscape for fresher flesh! It is for that day and that day alone we train... The power of Altana compels you!
10526 : With the advancement of the colonization effort, people have begun reporting sightings of crrryptic fiends darker than the most ominous shadow and often said to be harrrbingers of disaster.
10527 : These crrreatures, named umbrils, may just be the entities that the exorcists have been trrraining to combat all these years. At least that's what Vortimere tells us.
10528 : This extravagant edifice is one of the many assets held by our current minister of judication, Hildebert.
10529 : However, Hildebert is an assiduous individual whose services are constantly in demand by the general public. As he rarely has the opportunity to return to his abode, he graciously allows Vortimere to occupy it.
10530 : Should you ever need the counsel of either of these esteemed statesmen, this would be the place at which to seek it.
10531 : This is the maintenance-waintenance tunnel into the Rala Waterways. It's coalition policy not to let people wander down there, but we'll make an exception if you're willing to cooperate with us Peacekeepers.
10532 : Descend into the Rala Waterways? Yes. No.
10533 : What'd you say your name was? ...%? Never heard it before. Prrrobably because it's not worth hearing. Can you even name one herrroic feat you've accomplished here?
10534 : Your name's...%? Sounds vaguely familiar, like some nonsense a derrranged beggar would mutter to himself in the alleyways.
10535 : Your name's %, is it? Surrrprisingly enough, I do rrremember hearing it. Too bad I forget why.
10536 : I'll admit that some people in Adoulin might know your name, but don't let that go to your head. You still haven't prrroven yourself one bit in my eyes.
10537 : Your name's making the rrrounds in Adoulin. I hear it on the lips of passersby rrrather often.
10538 : Many Adoulinians marrrvel at what you've done. It won't be long before everyone in town knows your name.
10539 : You've become a household name thrrroughout the sacred city. Everyone's waiting to hear what amazing feats you'll purrrform next!
10540 : You've trrruly grabbed your dreams by the scruff and rrripped them from the paws of mediocrity! Not an hour passes without some [maiden blushing over the mention of your name/man prrrofessing his love for you in the streets].
10541 : Your name belongs in the annals alongside August Adoulin's as an example of a trrrue hero. Don't let anyone tell you differently!
10542 : Oh? Have you come to inquirrre about something?
10543 : What will you ask? What's my reputation like here? What's my coalition rank? Nothing.
10544 : Adoulin's esteemed coalitions have given you the following titles due to your supporrrt for their activities:
10545 : %'s coalition ranks:  Pioneers': [Petitioner/Probationer/Disciple/Contributor/Partner/Advisor/Magnate/Legend]. Peacekeepers': [Petitioner/Probationer/Disciple/Contributor/Partner/Advisor/Magnate/Legend]. Couriers': [Petitioner/Probationer/Disciple/Contributor/Partner/Advisor/Magnate/Legend]. Scouts': [Petitioner/Probationer/Disciple/Contributor/Partner/Advisor/Magnate/Legend]. Inventors': [Petitioner/Probationer/Disciple/Contributor/Partner/Advisor/Magnate/Legend]. Mummers': [Petitioner/Probationer/Disciple/Contributor/Partner/Advisor/Magnate/Legend].
10546 : Should you desire furrrther information, you only need inquire at the Civil Registrar located in the [./Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition.
10547 : I am grrreatly honored to have spoken with a legendary pioneer such as yourself.
10548 : Stop loitering in frrront of Castle Adoulin or I'll gouge your eyes out!
10549 : May I help you? ...You wish for me to announce your prrresence to Ikhi Askamot?
10550 : %!
10551 : Nhili, % is a geomancer, just like me. Please let us see Ikhi Askamot.
10552 : Ah, yes, dearrr Sylvie. I'd love to help, but she is quite busy these days...
10553 : Please! Please! It's a matter of life or death!
10554 : My goodness! Sylvie, daaarling, what are you doing way out here?
10555 : Lhaiso!
10556 : Are those...tears, my pet? Whatever could be wrong?
10557 : Well, this is quite the pickle for you then, no? To think, Hostenn missing, gone without a trace.
10558 : A geomancer going missing can only mean one thing--he has incurred the wrath of nature herself. Tragic.
10559 : Oh dear, I have perhaps been a bit harsh. I meant no ill will, I assure you.
10560 : N-no, it's all right. I'm just pleased that you understand how difficult this is for me.
10561 : I'm here to ask for Ikhi's aid--she's the reincarnation of the primal geomancer, Sih Renaye, right?
10562 : But it must be fate that brought me to you, great Lhaiso. Finally, something's gone right.
10563 : P-please! I want you to help Daddy!
10564 : Why, little Sylvie, of course I understand why you would come to me. Your emotions have truly touched me, however...
10565 : My best disciple, Ikhi, cannot help you. And of course, that means my aid is absolutely out of the question.
10566 : B-but...why?
10567 : The legendary Sih Renaye became one with nature, causing rivers to change their course and trees to sprout tall in mere moments.
10568 : And then, together with her five disciples, she prevailed over the ferocious Velkk.
10569 : Why do you suppose this is? This is simply a personal theory, dear, but I think it is because she was not actually a person.
10570 : Great Lhaiso, why do you deign to share your thoughts with these outsiders?
10571 : And Sylvie, surely your father's companions are out looking for him.
10572 : It's not our place to look for him. He cast his lot with the pioneers, and so it is up to them to find him.
10573 : So Sylvie, dearest, surely you can accept our position.
10574 : I-I can't believe... This is because I'm of Zacariah's blood, isn't it? Fine. I'll go look for him myself!
10575 : Oh, the sweet thing has got it backwards. Our desire to help her is without question--we just don't have the ability to do so.
10576 : You there--yes, you. I can sense that you have a stronger bond with her than I--go in my stead and help save her father.
10577 : Hostenn was last seen in Morimar Basalt Fields, was he not? Then someone at the frontier station there might be able to tell you more.
10578 : Sylvie's quite brrrash to head to Morimar Basalt Fields all by her lonesome. It would be terrible if some ill fate were to befall her, too.
10579 : Lhaiso has ordered you to go find her fatherrr, Hostenn. Her wishes must be respected.
10580 : And if you are a pioneerrr, you must be intimately familiar with the area. The frontier station there can surely update you on the situation.
10581 : Other members of the orderrr have told me that even though the great Lhaiso herself went to help Hostenn, he was unable to be saved.
10582 : Despite being of the Zacariah lineage, he was a geomancer of the highest caliberrr. He shall be missed.
10583 : Ah, %... Ikhi Askamot and Lhaiso Neftereh have been waiting for you.
10584 : I am afrrraid, however, that Lhaiso has taken ill. Please make your visit brrrief.
10585 : Lhaiso, forgive my impudence, but I must be frank.
10586 : You may have fallen ill because the higher power is angered at your assistance of the blood of the betrayer.
10587 : I disagree. The higher power would not castigate her just because we aided another.
10588 : No, what's more likely is that the betrayer's descendant poisoned her.
10589 : And Lhaiso, what do you think?
10590 : I cannot quite put my finger on it...but it probably has to do with our total inability to stop the colonization of Ulbuka.
10591 : Look who it is! One of the pioneers who caused all this trouble to begin with!
10592 : This is why I was completely opposed to sharing the powers of the geomancer with one so intent on pillaging and defiling the land.
10593 : That's enough out of you all. This [man/woman] is a guest of ourrrs.
10594 : Forgive me for not being able to give you a proper greeting, %.
10595 : Lhaiso used the power of the Communion to converse with something greater than us...the higher power...
10596 : I suppose I am so tired because the spell took the wind out of my sails.
10597 : %, I called you to this manse today because I have something to bequeath unto you.
10598 : Is it wise to entrust this one with something so precious?
10599 : Here...for you.
10600 : Many assert that it was a grave mistake for geomancers to have lent their aid to the colonization effort.
10601 : But Ikhi and I were both in accord that this issue of opening up the continent is one that should be resolved with the pioneers, not in spite of them.
10602 : Nature--the higher power--has strrriven for eons to reconcile the irreconcilable within her loving embrace.
10603 : We, too, must follow her example.
10604 : As both a pioneer and a geomancer, you stand at the crossroads of two disparate worlds.
10605 : I hope, my dear, that you will continue to work with us to find an answer.
10606 : The great Lhaiso's condition grows increasingly grrrave by the day. I cannot help but harbor a dark sense of foreboding.
10607 : %...and Sylvie! You come at the purrrfect time. Lhaiso has been asking for you.
10608 : Please, go right in...and when you rrreturn, allow me to inquire as to her physical state.
10609 : For you see, she has shut herself in her room and rrrefuses to allow even her most trusted servants entry.
10610 : %... You in particularrr have piqued her interest. Please, make sure she is well.
10611 : Sylvie... %... Thank you for coming.
10612 : Lhaiso! A-are you all right?
10613 : There is something...I need to share. And I know that the two of you would understand me more easily than anyone else.
10614 : Forgive me for cutting to the quick, but my body is quite frail of late.
10615 : Back in the basalt fields...when I used the primal geomancer's bell...
10616 : I think that when I called out to nature, I awoke the higher power that had been sleeping within Adoulin for eons.
10617 : We have incurred its wrath--by the way we have destroyed nature with every step we make into Ulbuka.
10618 : Just the other night, when I began to ring the fabled bell...
10619 : <Why dost thou think geomancers are aware of the lifestream and able to manipulate the forces of Indi and Geo?>
10620 : <Thou appearest to be of the mind that thy control over the lifestream is due to thy dedication and research.>
10621 : <It is contemptible beyond compare that thou hast forgotten why we bequeathed this power to thee.>
10622 : <Children of Altana, thou seekest naught but destruction. We have always faced thee with fear and trepidation.>
10623 : <Thy kind hath forgotten that thou art but one speck of a greater whole, and thus seek to leave thine indelible mark upon our flesh.>
10624 : <Yet Sih was different. Sih believed that humanity's calling was to respect and understand us, and she felt that thy kind could carry out this most noble of goals.>
10625 : I know, perhaps more than anyone else, that it was our fault that the pioneering initiative was not stopped.
10626 : But please, hear me out--pioneering is a must if Adoulin is to survive!
10627 : As the heir to the primal geomancer Sih Renaye's legacy, I have come to this conclusion even in light of the respect and understanding I have for nature!
10628 : I know that we must press on...if we are to live to see another century.
10629 : <Thou dost speak like he did... Like Zacariah did... Then thou art upholding the oath we made him swear in centuries past. Prove thy dedication...in the land where he resides.>
10630 : That is what the higher power told me...and I am no longer able to ring this most sacred of bells.
10631 : N-no...
10632 : Yet I am not the only one. Ikhi was unable to call forth its power as well. She has gathered the other geomancers of our order in an attempt to perform the Communion...
10633 : But they will surely fail. That is why I called the two of you.
10634 : What the higher power taught to Zacariah...it was how to become one with the lifestream, was it not?
10635 : Then you, Sylvie...as a direct descendant of Zacariah, you may be able to get the higher power to respond to your call.
10636 : And %...as one who walks the path of both pioneer and geomancer, your heartfelt feelings will surely call out to it.
10637 : It should be...something I do together with the other...geomancers...but...
10638 : I just cannot...I am faltering, I...
10639 : Please, take the bell and...go with Sylvie to...to where Zacariah sleeps.
10640 : Lhaiso!
10641 : Lhaiso has fallen into a deep slumberrr. The mages from the Order of Janniston have placed a moratorium on anyone entering or leaving her chamber.
10642 : %, I think you and I know what we have to do.
10643 : It's back to Cirdas Caverns, where Daddy and Zacariah are buried!
10644 : The mages from the Order of Janniston have rrrequested that Lhaiso be left to her slumber.
10645 : This is the first time in ages that such a trrragedy has befallen us. I hope everything will be all right.
10646 : Lhaiso has rrreturned to us!
10647 : Your brrravery has truly touched us all. The entire order owes you a debt of gratitude.
10648 : Always a pleasure doin' business with ya. As fer the brrread, this is about all I can bake at the moment. Take it or leave it, buster.
10649 : Runje Desaali stares intently at you.
10650 : That's a keen body ya got goin' on, [tough guy/bearcat].
10651 : Oh, I don't mean it in a cat scrrratch fever-type of way.
10652 : I just meant that you's got more of an aura 'bout ya than the cugines 'rrround these parts.
10653 : You's frrrom the Middle Lands, ain'tchya?
10654 : You from the Middle Lands? Yep. Nope.
10655 : Huh, whaddya know. Oh well, it ain't my concern.
10656 : What does concern me is yer prrrowess as a pioneer.
10657 : Ah, I almost furrrgot ta introduce m'self. As I always say, It's trust that funds good business. <Wink>
10658 : The name's Runje Desaali, and sellin' goods is my game. I's just a rrrun-of-the-mill merchant from the teensiest of the southern islands.
10659 : In all my years on the lam, I ain't never seen a continent so wild as this one. Mindartia, Quon, Aradjiah...they's so overcrrrowded compared to this place.
10660 : It always pays ta be foist on the scene. Ya get ta make yer own rules, see. That's why I hopped a ship as soon as I heard they were lookin' fer pioneers.
10661 : But I rrreally didn't expect things ta play out the way they did.
10662 : Walkin' about the Corrronal Esplanade, I bumped inta a Taru by the name of Chero-Machero. I swear, his lips flapped faster'n the west wind, but his sense fer dough was spot on.
10663 : After we talked shop fer a while, I found out that he's big cheese in Adoulin...
10664 : There ain't gonna be no better mark than this! I rrreasoned, so I purred my heart out, made him a cat's-paw, and now I's peddlin' under the Oider of Goiney name.
10665 : But don't go blabbin' this all over the strrreet. I'd hafta send ya a message through the mouth, if ya know what I mean.
10666 : Just say I'm runnin' an on-the-level operation thanks to an Adoulinian noble's good grrraces. That oughtta do it.
10667 : Ya keep it at that, and I won't brrrin' in the enforcers.
10668 : But you don't wanna hear the whole History of Runje, do ya? This ain't no shakedown, but if ya got any currrios the locals say have a history behind them, I'm all ears.
10669 : Trade me one, and I'll pay ya trrribute with some fat-cat bayld.
10670 : Now bugger off unless ya got somethin' for me.
10671 : Got some business with me?
10672 : Got business with her? Nope. Buy %. View materials. [(GEO)/(RUN)] Quit collecting. [(GEO)/(RUN)] Resume collecting materials. (GEO) Resume collecting materials. (RUN) Which weapons can I trade? What's with the leafkin? High-purity bayld? I want some %. What does Geosuke recommend? What are special services? I want to check treasures.
10673 : Anytime, [wiseguy/wisegal].
10674 : I's mainly interested in the merchandise prrrovided by the Peacekeepers' Coalition. You know, traditional weaponry or whatever name ya give 'em.
10675 : I ain't above takin' those Records of Eminence rrrewards, either. A.M.A.N. makes some ducky stuff.
10676 : What adventurers from the Middle Lands may see as the dullest of the dull, the cafones here'll cram down their own throats in glee. The grrrass is always greener, see.
10677 : Fer yer fine contributions, I'll make ya an offer ya can't rrrefuse...1/# the price you's bought it fer, but in bayld.
10678 : I'll also take special equipment dropped by the lords of the jungle off yer hands. Those that ya can't offload on those shrills at the auction house.
10679 : I's got me a strrrict no-returns policy, too. Try to take one back and I'll put out a contrrract on ya.
10680 : What's gonna happen to yer prrrecious little weapon after ya part ways with it?
10681 : It'll help me fulfill favors to people who visit me on the day of my daughter's weddin'.
10682 : Copacetic, rrright?
10683 : Have anything to say? Not particularly... Very fine, indeed. Remain silent.
10684 : Why not!? As the don of my own enterprrrise, I's gotta prepare fer the future.
10685 : Naw, I'm just pullin' yer leg. I actually send the valuable ones to my soldiers who distrrribute them to-- Haha, ya almost had me givin' away my trade secret there.
10686 : Exactly! Gotta put family foist.
10687 : Say somethin'! Anythin'! I'm dyin' over here.
10688 : All that aside, I want me some old-time weapons. Rrremember that.
10689 : Oh, this friend of mine? I picked him up on an excurrrsion with a Scouts' Coalition survey crew.
10690 : He was losin' foliage rrright and left when I found him. Someone musta put out a hit on him.
10691 : I've no idea--they's pretty harmless. I only know them from the Mummers' Coalition shield prrrize and rumors, but I'd say they's more mischievous than malicious.
10692 : Don't get me wrong--I'd've let him get pinched except for that his cutesy face might brrrin' in customers. Oooh, I'd give away all my equipment just to pet Runje's little shrub again!
10693 : Those so-called reconnaissance expurrrts didn't even see me sweep this guy up from under they's noses! Maybe I should take up griftin', too!
10694 : Despite my intentions, this bramble's taken a likin' ta yers trrruly.
10695 : And his leafy face is startin' ta grrrow on me, not to mention that since he don't speak right, he's a real stand-up guy.
10696 : Gwrk.
10697 : Did I tell ya he's got a swingin' supernatural power?
10698 : Give him % and he'll crrrank out bushels of special crystallized ergon tinctures.
10699 : I's found a way to take those crystallizations and synthesize 'em into choice rings poifect fer a discernin' fencer like yaself.
10700 : Sadly, one % ain't gonna getchya very far...
10701 : I's been waitin' with bated brrreath fer ya ta ask that question!
10702 : As ya can imagine from the name, it's bayld that's of a higherrr quality than the normal stuff.
10703 : The power layin' low in this stuff is two--no, three times more effective than yer used to. Plus, ya gotta bootleg it into the city, makin' fer a rrrisky and expensive venture.
10704 : <Sniff><sniff> Hm, that's the smell of sawdust fer sure. If ya know the % skill, then I's sure ya seen high-purity bayld in some form before.
10705 : Ya know those tree roots that block yer path in the jungle and are thicker'n the gams on Ingrid, right? Then do ya rrrecall that some sparkly powder flies up when ya break 'em?
10706 : My merrrchant's intuition tells me that's where it comes from.
10707 : And considerin' that pioneers say they's been gettin' the stuff from rrreives, I's inclined to trust that hunch.
10708 : We ain't prrrivy to much, but I do know that research's been pluggin' along nicely of late, and that's how the grit's startin' to get found.
10709 : Getting back on trrrack, % are just the berries now.
10710 : Aaand, as luck would have it...
10711 : I just got some as vigorrrish this mornin'.
10712 : What's more, I's havin' a sale of unprrrecedented proportions on it for all my [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] customers!
10713 : Ya too can have yer very own pinch of it for the low, low prrrice of # bayld.
10714 : Lemme say it again, as it bears rrrepeatin'. Yer timin' couldn't be more impeccable.
10715 : Someone call a back-alley doctor, 'cuz I's bleedin' m'self drrry by givin' them away fer this little.
10716 : What a pathetic joke. We all know ya took the omerta. Don't ya dare ever say somethin' that dumb ta me again, you stupid strunz.
10717 : Were you just making a joke? No, I really want out. Yes, and I'm sorry.
10718 : Damn rrright ya's sorry.
10719 : Be warned. Not only will ya lose all the materials ya gathered, but yer gonna be chased to the ends of Vana'diel. Our family don't...take kindly to trrraitors.
10720 : Truly give up? Yes, I'm not afraid. No! I'm sorry!
10721 : ...Fine.
10722 : Aaand now forrrk over the weapon ya wanna give up on.
10723 : Don't ya worry, I'll take rrreal good care of this beauty.
10724 : Here's yer weapon back--I assume yer gonna need it.
10725 : The sale's still on, but not fer long! Get pinches of 'em fer # bayld apiece before time rrruns out!
10726 : How many do you want? Enter either a number 1 through #, or 0 to cancel. (Bayld: #)
10727 : Purchase # pinches? Yes, take my # bayld! Nope.
10728 : That trrribute's lookin' a bit small, ya [Dumb Dan/Dumb Dora]. Gimme the correct amount before I pop ya one.
10729 : Alrrrighty, # ) to the [jolly gent/lucky lady]!
10730 : Pullin' the ol' bait-and-switch, I see. Let's hope you live to rrregret it.
10731 : Here's a little kickback fer bein' such a big spenderrr.
10732 : Runje provides you with # pinches of high-purity bayld free of charge!
10733 : I's runnin' a special campaign, so they'rrre yours fer only # bayld a piece! So, how many ya want?
10734 : How many would you like? Enter either a number 1 through #, or 0 to cancel. (Bayld: #)
10735 : Purchase # piece[/s]? Yes, take my # bayld! Nope.
10736 : That trrribute's lookin' a bit small, ya [Dumb Dan/Dumb Dora]. Gimme the correct amount before I pop ya one.
10737 : Alrrrighty, # ) to the [jolly gent/lucky lady]!
10738 : Pullin' the ol' bait-and-switch, I see. Let's hope you live to rrregret it.
10739 : Here's a little kickback fer bein' such a big spenderrr.
10740 : Runje provides you with # free of charge!
10741 : Most of 'em were found by Geosuke, but they'rrre all top quality, I assure ya!
10742 : Geosuke's got a bunch of special treasures fer you!
10743 : So, what'll it be? (Bayld: #) Never mind. % (# bayld) %. (# bayld) %.# bayld) %.# bayld) %.# bayld) %.# bayld) %.# bayld) %. (# bayld) Maybe next time.
10744 : %, is it? That'll be # bayld. Are ya sure yer good fer it?
10745 : Purchase the %? Here's my # bayld. Ummm, on second thought...
10746 : %, is it? That'll be # bayld. Are ya sure ya can afforrrd it?
10747 : Purchase the %? Take my # bayld already! I'll pass for now.
10748 : Thanks! Hope ya enjoy yer %!
10749 : Therrre ya go! Hope ya like yer %!
10750 : My little patsy Geosuke here has got some special serrrvices for those who have %.
10751 : Check which? Go back. %. [/] %. [/] %. [/] %. [/]  %. [/] %. [/] %. [/] %. [/] %. [/] %. [/] %. [/] %. [/] Nothing for now.
10752 : I can make that one a little more special fer ya, and it'll look somethin' like this:
10753 : Youse want to improve it? It'll run ya % and # %.
10754 : The state of yer [geomancer/rune fencer] weapon vig is somethin' like this:
10755 : %: [Needed/Acquired].
10756 : %: # of # acquired. (# needed)
10757 : %: All # acquired.
10758 : Why, it's my favorrrite shill! Wait...what's that [wand/sword] yer wavin' about?
10759 : So you say someone just gave ya this thing and said There's some latent potential in there, go!? What a rrracket!
10760 : This's gotta be just a gaff... No, it's the rrreal deal!
10761 : Let me getta look at that piece of worrrk.
10762 : Could use a good brushin' up, but nothin' Geosuke and I can't handle.
10763 : All it needs is ta be [bathed in the powerrrs of nature/taken to special fonts of powerrr].
10764 : And what'll ya need then? Not more'n a special [ergon crystal/runey ring].
10765 : So if you wanna stop bein' a scab 'n make yer [wand/sword] all purrretty, brin' me...
10766 : ...%, %, %...
10767 : ...%...
10768 : ...# %...
10769 : ...and # %.
10770 : Then trrrade 'em to [that jamook Geosuke/me].
10771 : Don' look so banged up. Just get 'em bit by bit and we'll keep 'em locked away safe.
10772 : See, Geosuke, I says ta myself, Runje, everrr see such a piece o' work?...
10773 : Let's count up the vig ya brrrought for your [geomancer/rune fencer] weapon...
10774 : Hmm...# ), right?
10775 : Hand over items for your [geomancer/rune fencer] weapon? Beyond doubt. On second thought, no.
10776 : I'll hafta off ya if ya keep wastin' my time!
10777 : Grrreat!
10778 : I's after rrriches like the next Mithra, but I ain't no booster, see? Here's the extra ya gave me.
10779 : G-Geosuke? What're ya up ta over there?
10780 : Ya dirty rat! I's scared half to death!
10781 : C'mon, show mama what ya got there.
10782 : Wh-whoa! Where'd ya ever learn to make...
10783 : Ahem. No, I's not skeptical. A shark like him sure knows how to fix up some sugar!
10784 : Just dip that ol' wand of yours inta the right ergon locus, and it'll be done faster'n ol' Gratzigg can put the screws on the Mummers' Coalition.
10785 : Now, if we just tinker with this here crystal...
10786 : Poifect.
10787 : Just find a place filled with runic enerrrgies and it'll be done before I can think up my next racket!
10788 : Now, scrrram!
10789 : Geosuke? What're ya holdin' therrre?
10790 : That's...that's %!
10791 : Damn [bastahd/puttanti], ya didn't just up 'n chuck it out, didya?
10792 : Did you drop it? Uh...oopsie. Must be someone else's.
10793 : Then who could've...?
10794 : Ya did!? Yeah, yer a real wiseguy, ain't ya? It's all crrracked 'n chipped!
10795 : <Sigh> I can make it mint-new, but it'll cost ya.
10796 : # gil. Any less 'n I'll get the whole family after ya. Just trade it ta me.
10797 : Good. One less thing on my moind.
10798 : Dun be so careless next time. What kinda joint ya think I'm runnin' here?
10799 : %! How wonderrrful to see you here! The entire order remains in your debt after all you did to help Sylvie and Lhaiso.
10800 : In fact, your coming could not have been at a more forrrtuitous time. I recently stopped by Celennia Memorial Library and chanced upon a volume of much import.
10801 : It references certain forces of darkness that existed ages ago, with rrruins remaining somewhere in the Dho Gates.
10802 : I've neverrr been one to give in to fables that easily, but forces of darkness? It certainly gives one pause.
10803 : Could I perhaps trrrouble you to investigate this matter in my stead?
10804 : Will you assist Nhili? Of course. I've done enough for your order.
10805 : How unfortunate. Purrrhaps I should ask another.
10806 : You have my grrratitude--though exploration is its own reward.
10807 : I would go myself, but...I couldn't possibly tearrr myself away from here to go someplace so scar--far away.
10808 : After all, someone must prrrevent the uncouth from bothering Ikhi or Lhaiso.
10809 : A...handbell?
10810 : I see. But why would this be sitting in the inner rrrecesses of Dho Gates?
10811 : Was it something lost to the ages, or left there deliberrrately? This requires further study in the library.
10812 : You may keep the bell in the meantime. Its unique forrrm and metallic composition are enough for me to go on.
10813 : And I'm not saying that because it looks...crrreepy. Because it doesn't.
10814 : My memory is near flawless, and thus I do not rrrequire it to be on hand.
10815 : I have but one condition--do not sell it to some unsavory peddler or toss it away like last week's leftover brrread.
10816 : And please, be carrreful should you happen upon a Mithra claiming to be from Zhwa. She'd do anything to get her paws on something so valuable.
10817 : ...!
10818 : You there, the [cake-eater/broad]--how's about givin' me a look at the bell you're pawing arrround with.
10819 : Fooowhee, that's some ancient heat yer packing there!
10820 : Y'know who could fix it rrright up for you? Me and Geosuke. Ain't never seen another leafkin who could mewl with the best of 'em!
10821 : But we can get it all dolled up if ya brin' us # %.
10822 : Ask her to fix it up? Sounds like a plan. I've no interest in this arrangement.
10823 : Yer a rrreal pill, ya know that?
10824 : Oh ho, fate's dealt me a cooler this time 'rrround.
10825 : Been quite a while since I've gotten a joib this rrritzy!
10826 : This might be yer only chance, and I promises I'll do it up rrright swell. So what'll it be?
10827 : Have her repair the bell? Yes. Geomancy waits for no one. I'd rather not.
10828 : Brin' mama the ice! You know what you gotta do--go foind me # %.
10829 : Do that, and I'll have this ol' arrrtifact of yers singin' like a canary.
10830 : But if'n ya trrrade them to me instead of Geosuke...then it's right to the moon!
10831 : He might not look th' part, but the guy's as hard-boiled as they come.
10832 : If I says I can get the worrrk done, then I does it!
10833 : But I ain't no fence, see? So don' even think of askin' me how ta use it.
10834 : Ya know who ya gotta ask? The dons over at the Order of Renaye. Ya got a beef with geomancy, ya go to them.
10835 : Why, hello again, %! Rrremember how I was going to research the bell you found? Well, you see...
10836 : Oh my! You cerrrtainly did gussy it up while I was knee-deep in books from the historical archives.
10837 : This crrrest is utterly fascinating. Could it be from the age of...? Ah, but forgive me. You didn't come to hear a treatise on ancient symbols.
10838 : You mentioned you found it buried beneath some rrrubble in Dho Gates, no? Then perhaps it is a relic of a battle in years gone by that happened there many centuries past.
10839 : Of course, no records of such bloodshed exist...so I had to rely on more esoterrric sources. A book of fables, to be precise. But the details seem to fit.
10840 : Do you suppose the spirits of the fallen rrreside within its metallic shell? Ugh...my head is beginning to swim.
10841 : I need to take a brief rrrespite...should you desire to learn more, I wish you Goddess-speed.
10842 : %! Have you found out anything?
10843 : You...what? What!? I-Ikhi! Ikhi!!!
10844 : Is it true...? You went into the deepest recesses and fought against a geomancer?
10845 : An ancient, forgotten geomancerrr...and this %...
10846 : Countless centuries ago, in a time most of us would consider legend, there was one geomancer whose bell resounded throughout the skies, and whose staff was formed from crrrystallized lifestream essence.
10847 : Every geomancer in the order learns this parrrable, but few consider it to be gospel... Yet contained in every grandiose tale lies seeds of truth. I hereby bequeath unto you this wand, that you may continue your studies in the way she did.
10848 : The % you found is no trinket of ages past. It is a sign from the purrrsonage you saw there. She has deemed you worthy of carrying on her legacy.
10849 : ...Mayhaps I misspoke. Though this wand indeed bears vestiges of yore, it also compels you to forge your own path.
10850 : After all, legacies are but pretty words if we do not let them guide us to even greaterrr actions. It is what nature wishes. It is what I wish.
10851 : Can you feel it, %? The higher power, calling to you...
10852 : Madonn'!
10853 : My whiskers're gettin' the heebie-jeebies, which can only mean ya've got ahold of somethin' with trrremendous runic powers!
10854 : Aha, that's it! It's gotta be comin' frrrom that %!
10855 : Time for Geosuke ta go ta woik.
10856 : Hmmm...It's lookin' like we'll need # % ta finish the joib.
10857 : What do you think? Please, work your magic! Get outta here.
10858 : No, you get outta here, poverrrett! We ain't need yer cheapness filthin' up our operation.
10859 : Supoib! I ain't had no gigs like this fer as long as I can rrremember.
10860 : Just lemme get somethin' outta the way foist.
10861 : This might be yer only chance, so keep that in moind. Okay, what'll it be?
10862 : Have her make the weapon? Well, if you say so. On second thought, get outta here.
10863 : Then you'll hafta prrrocure me # %, [wiseguy/wisegal].
10864 : If ya can manage that, we might just be able ta extrrract that runic essence. It'll take all my cunnin', but I'm up ta the task!
10865 : Trrrade me the materials and we can make a marriage between our two parties.
10866 : Now go out there and do this outfit prrroud.
10867 : Holy moly, what a brrrilliant success!
10868 : This might be the foist time in all my nine lives I's ever laid my peepers on a catalyst with such prrristine magic.
10869 : Although... After mullin' it over, I'd say it's closer to rrrunic energy than normal, old magic.
10870 : I can't quite make heads or tails outta this. Ya might hafta ask someone who comprrrehends runes a bit better'n me.
10871 : Ah, 'tis you, my right-hand runeist with steady hands. It seems that with each blow you deal your foes, my expectations of you are blown hither and thither. How you have matured since we last exchanged greetings.
10872 : I am no oracle, but intuition tells me that your visit was catalyzed by a catalyst. More specifically, %, perhaps?
10873 : Forgive me my trespass upon your mind--I simply assumed that you would not mind. But I jest. In truth, I had been informed that two acolytes of the rune were about to awaken in nearly as many awakenings of the sun.
10874 : It seems you have found the solution to how to prevent that runic solution from thoroughly devouring your sanity. That alone is proof enough of your awakening.
10875 : As for the other...
10876 : It proved too challenging for me to refrain from reading his challenge to you.
10877 : Apparently, your duel is to take place in the Watergarden Coliseum. <Sigh> Being reminded of the Rala Waterways always gets my waterworks flowing.
10878 : Before, I would have stood my ground and stood between you two, but I know there is no sense in that now.
10879 : My only advice is this--fly high and strike true with your bladed talons, young runeist.
10880 : I heard you put on an astounding performance at the coliseum, %. Now, have audience with our order's maester, who should handsomely reward you for your handsom--er, masterful display of swordsmanship.
10881 : Youse got %, do ya?
10882 : Hand on a sec, buster. You're the [guy/gal] who had the % from before!
10883 : I's got eyes for clever thinks, y'see?
10884 : That li'l thing ya brought me just now--only Geosuke and his friends can give them out to those they trust.
10885 : It's kinda a badge of pride, see? And because you've got one, I's can offer ya special services.
10886 : I know, I know, you want to know more. So I'll tell ya: I can improve special treasures from each of the Twelve Orders.
10887 : Bet I got yer interest, didn't I?
10888 : And I've also got special deals for [/Hume maes/Hume females/Elvaan males/Elvaan females/Tarutaru males/Tarutaru females/Mithra/Galka] just like you! Only # %!
10889 : Just trade me yer treasure along with # %.
10890 : Let me know if ya wanna see what it's like once I's done with it.
10891 : Or wait...ya don't have any applicable treasures?
10892 : Then I can't do nothin' fer ya.
10893 : If ya had one but lost it, someone at th' castle might be able to help ya!
10894 : Oho! Brought it did ya?
10895 : Geosuke, c'mere and do yer thing!
10896 : My turn now!
10897 : Purrrfect! [A good first try, I's gotta say./Looks like it worked this time!]
10898 : I mean...of course everything went well!
10899 : Ah, and maybe I's forgot. Absolutely no returns or refunds.
10900 : G'job, Geosuke! I figured I could train you good!
10901 : Ah, if it isn't I's favorrrite pioneer!
10902 : Turns out I gots a job fer ya. A bit of a time-sensitive issue frrrom a contact in Eastern Adoulin.
10903 : A jungle crrreepy-crawly appears to have dropped a valuable piece o' equipment of sorts, and they want it.
10904 : I's not too sure o' the details, but it suppos'dly be very popular with some forrreign tradesmen.
10905 : Normally I be keepin' 'em in stock, but turns out my supply all but run drrry.
10906 : 'N that's where youse be comin' in. A battle o' a middleperson, if ya will.
10907 : 'Course, youse already be an experrrt in arms-dealin', no?
10908 : E'ry single one you find counts. Even just one be good enough. I's be payin' a fair price fer em, too.
10909 : Lemme show you the kind o' thing I's be needin'.
10910 : Betcha be interrrested now, hmmm?
10911 : Enough gabbin'. Get goin'!
10912 : Just know that what I's be needin' can't be bought on the auction house.
10913 : How's it goin'? Ya find anythin' off those crrreepy-crawlies?
10914 : 'Member ta keep at it!
10915 : Haha, the look on yer face! Dun worry, I's just be kiddin'. I's rememberrr our deal.
10916 : So dun be gettin' yer panties in a twist.
10917 : Hm? Ya 'spected somethin' else?
10918 : I dun remember that bein' part o' our deal.
10919 : Keep in mind that what I's be needin' ain't be available on yer e'ryday markets.
10920 : Ya wanna make the good cash, ya gotta stick yer neck out. That be the way o' things.
10921 : 'N the more dangerrrous the task, the higher the reward. Fair be fair, after all.
10922 : Remember what keeps me happy also keep Geosuke herrre happy. Got it? I'm sure he be willin' ta sell you his wares for...ya guessed it, a fair price.
10923 : We's all be friends here, no? So let's stay on each otherrr's good side.
10924 : Geosuke now offers an additional selection of items.
10925 : %! You could not have come at a more opporrrtune time!
10926 : Are you perchance a wandering geomancer? You could not have come at a more opporrrtune time!
10927 : What time might that be? Ahh...forrrget I said anything.
10928 : Would you be interested in furrrthering your geomantic training? Or rather, in unleashing your true potential?
10929 : The Order of Renaye houses a varrriety of artifacts within our hold, but chief among them is a line of enigmatic wands that initiates train with to amplify the energies of the lifestream in new ways.
10930 : Would you like to experience this powerrr for yourself?
10931 : Learn more about geomantic mysteries? I'd love to! I'm a bit busy right now...
10932 : A-and after we've come this far together... How unforrrtunate.
10933 : B-but you seemed so reliable... How unforrrtunate.
10934 : %! Have you rrreconsidered my offer? After all, the lifestream waits for no [man/woman]!
10935 : Wonderrrful!
10936 : Wonderrrful!
10937 : Then I bid you wield this wand and execute weapon skills upon your foes. The more the better!
10938 : Report back and trade me the weapon should you learrrn anything new.
10939 : Mayhap my instructions were unclear. You need to actually use weapon skills. Have you been leaving this heirloom to rrrot in your bags?
10940 : Aha! I can feel a faint aura resonating within its slender frrrame.
10941 : Yes...the haft is noticeably tingling. I'd say you'rrre halfway there!
10942 : Amazing! The enerrrgies, once latent, are wholly palpable!
10943 : Purrrform more weapon skills, and I'm sure something amazing will happen!
10944 : A pleasurrre, as always. How fare your adventures with the wand I lent you?
10945 : How are you finding the wand? I've nothing to report. I've lost my %. I'm not interested anymore.
10946 : Y-you what!?
10947 : I lectured you on the import and symbolism of this task, and you went and threw it in the trrrash!? <Sigh>... Let me get you a new one.
10948 : All the work with the old one has gone to waste...so it's back to squarrre one for you!
10949 : N-not interested!? Then all your efforrrts will have been for naught! Are you absolutely sure?
10950 : Really abandon Nhili's task? Yes. I have no time for this. No. I'd like to reconsider.
10951 : Oh, by the lifestream! If a Mithrrra has nine lives, then you just took away three of them!
10952 : O-oh no... I can't stop you, but...I'm rather disappointed.
10953 : Don't worry about rrreturning your %. We've got plenty in stock.
10954 : Let me take a look... Ah, splendid! Your dedication to geomancy is beyond comparrre.
10955 : Yes, this will help me ascend to an even higher...
10956 : Ah! I-Ikhi!?
10957 : Nhili? What's that you have there?
10958 : So you have completed your rrregimen with that %?
10959 : I, uh... Yes!
10960 : That wand enables the wielder to harness powers from ages past.
10961 : The arrrt of geomancy is not one for the impatient. Only those persistent in mastering their craft are capable of understanding the dormant energies within this wand.
10962 : I should not have to explain what this means. Though the wand has serrrved you well, Nhili, you have no need of it anymore.
10963 : An upsurge of energy bursts forth from the %.
10964 : Oh ho! So that's how it is, is it?
10965 : A geomancer's arsenal is not limited to the realm of the magical. I expect this art will serve you well as you strrrive [to bring harmony to nature in Adoulin./to protect Adoulin's natural environment./to do everything possible to save nature.]
10966 : Nhili...please come to my chambers once your watch has finished.
10967 : O-o-of course!
10968 : You have learned Exudation!
10969 : Good Goddess, is that woman over there ever beautiful. Absolutely no denying it.
10970 : You think so too, right?
10971 : Who do you look at? Yocile. Lola.
10972 : Ugh, for the love of all that is holy, no! I obviously meant the young brunette in the apron.
10973 : If only I could derive my sustenance from viewing her exquisite countenance... I'd never leave this spot.
10974 : oskin uses %.
10975 : Oh no, some malicious entity must be sucking the life force from me! I can barely even stand!
10976 : <Sniffle> I fear the only thing that can cure my malady is % specially prepared by Yocile.
10977 : Yes, only her milk's forbidden sweetness can save me from this living nightmare and deliver me to paradise.
10978 : If only a certain traveler from lands afar would find it in [his/her] heart to bring me some... No, I shouldn't indulge in such fantasies. That would never happen.
10979 : Indeed, chivalry is dead. No one would ever be so kind as to bring me % squeezed by Yocile.
10980 : Won't someone take pity on a poor invalid and bring me a bowl of Yocile's homemade ulbuconut milk?
10981 : Might I recommend %? This creamy beverage goes down so smoothly because I awake at the wee hours of each day to pour heaping portions of my love into it.
10982 : Yes, this is it! Mmm, I swear I can taste Yocile's love in this %. That really hits the spot.
10983 : Sorry that I asked you for another favor. To an outsider, it may even seem that I'm using you. To an outsider being the operative phrase here.
10984 : The fact, though, is that we found each other not through coincidence, but kismet.
10985 : I have proof of it, too.
10986 : Ever since I met you, the wheel of fortune has been spinning my way.
10987 : Have anything to say? I'll bite. What happened? Pfft, sure it has. Whatever you say, Roskin.
10988 : Heh heh heh, I knew you'd be interested.
10989 : I understand your incredulity. Just hear me out.
10990 : My journalistic prowess has been recognized...with a job featuring absolutely ludicrous compensation!
10991 : This new assignment deals with the Great Expedition.
10992 : What's even greater is that they'll pay one million bayld for a good article on it!
10993 : I'd challenge you to find a better offer in all of Vana'diel, but I already know what your answer will be.
10994 : Why, Roskin, a better offer just doesn't exist. Exactly!
10995 : And it is precisely this ever-so-important juncture at which we encounter each other.
10996 : Who would dare call that mere happenstance?
10997 : No one, that's who!
10998 : No one, that's who!
10999 : This meeting between our minds has been preordained for eons, with this % as the symbol of how sticky our bond is.
11000 : In other words...
11001 : I have been chosen by the Goddess for my mastery of the quill, and you have been chosen for your investigative talents. Therefore, you'll be doing all the field work.
11002 : You can't argue with fate, right?
11003 : Can you argue with fate? Nope, I'll gather the information. Yes, I can. Do your own legwork.
11004 : I figured as much. Most people aren't willing to accept their appropriate role in life if it doesn't match with their dream. Appropriate being the operative word here.
11005 : Can you still argue with fate, or are you ready to accept your destiny?
11006 : Of course you'd say that. However, just because you don't like your Goddess-given task--
11007 : Wait, what? You'll do it!?
11008 : Then it's settled. You'll dig for gems of information and I'll polish whatever you find with the power of the written word.
11009 : After that, I'll collect the reward and ask Yocile to court me.
11010 : With my newfound wealth, this plan will be completely foolproof! I love it!
11011 : Uuugh, shut up! You're gonna make me vomit with all that saccharine drivel!
11012 : Huh!?
11013 : Wh-wh-what a farce. You're going to research some bygone era to ask a g-g-girl out on a date?
11014 : I couldn't think of anything dumber. Guys from the West are utterly clueless.
11015 : You can't write interesting pieces while distracted by impure carnal thoughts. Everyone knows that!
11016 : Lower your voice! This assignment requires a strict adherence to secre--
11017 : So strict that even people across the Senroh Sea could hear your plans? Everyone in town knows that you're going to research historical events surrounding colonization and then try to c-c-court some hussy!
11018 : You disgust me.
11019 : Uuung... My constitution seems to have taken a drastic turn for the worse.
11020 : I'm not that naive, dimwit.
11021 : I am, however, a member of the Scouts' Coalition. Therefore, why don't I do you the favor of kicking your posterior in a little competition?
11022 : What are you saying?
11023 : I'm saying Why don't we see which one of us can gather the most valuable information first?
11024 : I'm obviously going to win, so you can kiss that obscene c-c-courtship of yours goodbye!
11025 : Then maybe you'll get it through your thick skull that the only "Yo" in your life should be "Yorcia Weald"!
11026 : This certainly doesn't bode well for me. Scouts' Coalition members make a living collecting intelligence. There's no way I can compete with a professional!
11027 : Erg! And now the poison's started to kick in. What atrocious timing.
11028 : I can barely stand, let alone interrogate people in this condition. You'll have to go in my stead, friend among friends.
11029 : Please crush that uncouth scout into figurative dust with your supreme powers of inquiry!
11030 : Now get out there and learn about the Great Expedition...for great justice!
11031 : Quick, there's no time! You have to gather information about what triggered the Great Expedition before that meddling girl does!
11032 : Lately, I feel like someone is constantly undressing me with their eyes while I work. It's so disturbing.
11033 : Where to find the rest...hmmm... My journalist's instinct tells me there's stuff to be had in...
11034 : %...
11035 : ...and maybe somewhere else, but maybe not.
11036 : % and nowhere else.
11037 : Huh? Where is that thing? I know I had it with me a minute ago.
11038 : Hey, that looks like the Scouts' Coalition-issue parchment we used for daily reports.
11039 : Writing on it with a special ink renders the text invisible to those without the proper decoding tools.
11040 : Judging from its consistency, I'd say it's the type our espionage agents stopped using a little while ago.
11041 : How do you decode them?
11042 : Hmmm... I guess if we're not using them anymore, there's no need to keep the process a secret.
11043 : The magic happens in Foret de Hennetiel. Certain poisons in the Zoldeff River will react with the ink, causing it to change color. Downright sorcerous, yeah?
11044 : I've seen Palomel taking some sheets from the stockroom every now and then, but I can't imagine she actually uses them. I know twitherym that're more skilled with ciphers than she is.
11045 : If you wanna see the magic in action, dip that paper somewhere along the Zoldeff River in Foret de Hennetiel.
11046 : You wouldn't happen to be one of those adventurers from abroad, would you?
11047 : You are? Phew, I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that. You see, I've come across a historical heirloom, but I can't hand it over to just anyone.
11048 : This painting was drawn roughly four hundred and eighty years ago by the most famous artist of the time. Now you see why I need to sell it to someone as worldly as you, right?
11049 : While the appraisers estimated its value at over 1,000,000 bayld, I know you'll give it a good home. That's why I'll discount it to a mere # bayld, all for your sake.
11050 : Buy it? (Bayld: #) For only #? Yes! I don't need no artsy-fartsy crap.
11051 : Oh, I'm sorry. I must have mistaken you for someone who isn't a philistine. No skin off my back, I'll just sell it to the next adventurer who comes waltzing by.
11052 : Tsk, tsk, tsk. Normally I tell my clients who aren't financially solvent to beat it, but I'll give you another chance.
11053 : You're in luck, I still haven't sold this most prestigious of artistic works. You want to purchase it for your collection?
11054 : Thanks! I guarantee you won't regret this. <Wink>
11055 : I'm just a lowly antiquary trying to make his way in this cruel world. Pay me no heed.
11056 : Ouah! Vous have an interest in this article? Well, le client is always right, so here you go!
11057 : In return, I simply ask that you tell your friends about my tablissement.
11058 : Wh-what? S-spit it out already! I don't have time to waste making idle chitchat with a rival.
11059 : You quickly flash her your % and %.
11060 : Th-those're... No...that can't be...!
11061 : Fine! I'll admit defeat!
11062 : Now I suppose you'll want to have your way with me, the l-l-lecher that you are.
11063 : Now I suppose you're going to spread insulting rumors about me all over the city, you sh-sh-shameless gossip.
11064 : Then wh-what could you want with me?
11065 : Aha! You're going to have the c-coalition axe me and my family disown me, aren't you!?
11066 : Oh, Mother and Father, why did you ever bring me into this cruel world?
11067 : Wait, that's not it either? Then what exactly do you want with me!?
11068 : ...Oh, yes, the events that gave rise to the Great Expedition.
11069 : Alright, I'll cooperate! Just g-g-gimme that back!
11070 : Palomel angrily swipes the % from your hands.
11071 : Hey, how'd you ever get your h-hands on such an ancient blade?
11072 : You f-found it lying within the floor of Woh Gates? I find that hard to believe.
11073 : Anyway, that d-definitely looks like a sword used in the rebellion around the year 350. Before even the first colonization initiative started in the early 400s, each order made it their top priority to wrest control of the settlement from the others, which obviously led to a v-violent insurgence.
11074 : I hate to admit it, but nice job finding an artifact of this much h-historical importance.
11075 : It looks like you've collected a lot of m-m-materials, but I bet you don't know squat about them. What do you need me to enlighten you on?
11076 : Show her what? Nothing. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
11077 : This looks to be a record concerning the rash of landshivers that assaulted the continent around three hundred years ago. Interesting... That's the same time that colonization was really starting to gain steam.
11078 : You're telling me that a random p-p-peddler claims this to be a four-hundred-eighty-year-old painting? I'm no connoisseur of fine art, but that sounds f-f-fishy to me.
11079 : Try showing it to someone at the Renaye residence. They might know b-b-better than me.
11080 : So it was just a replica after all.
11081 : If that's the case, this fake was probably drawn a year ago to capitalize on the colonization movement. It should only be worth what the materials cost--about 150 bayld.
11082 : Everyone in Adoulin seems to be talking about this walking enigma lately. He's always spotted trying his luck at the Mummers' Coalition's amusements, and his outfit's blacker than a funeral procession.
11083 : D-d-don't show that to a damn soul, you hear me!?
11084 : If you do, I'll cast a pox on you so that your breakfast always tastes like mud. Got it?
11085 : This record describes Sverdhried's trip back to Adoulin from a continent innumerable malms away.
11086 : If I had to guess, that'd put this document somewhere in the first half of the fifth century--right smack-dab in the middle of an early colonization initiative.
11087 : You can have my head on a pike if this isn't from the period when colonization really started to pick up--right before the Great Expedition.
11088 : Why am I so confident? Because everyone in the Scouts' Coalition knows this story. It talks about how a whole forest sprung up during the dead of night. Of course we'd be aware of an event of this magnitude.
11089 : This is a simple clerical entry from the year 607 detailing the export of giant sheep to the Middle Lands. Adoulin's mercantile pedigree may seem obvious to us now, but it looks like it all started thanks to early colonization efforts.
11090 : It's not written here, but apparently descendants of that breed can still be found grazing in the Zulkheim region.
11091 : Ugh, this thing's so c-c-crumpled and dirty it's practically illegible.
11092 : Hmmm... Considering how archaic the diction is, this couldn't be the same declaration Ygnas made. My guess is that it was issued in the first half of the 400s, during an early era of colonization.
11093 : Why, this's information about that underground garden everyone calls the Civic Arboretum. That facility was only erected five years ago, so this doesn't have much to do with the Great Expedition, I'm afraid.
11094 : The % they grow there are pretty d-d-divisive. You either love them or you hate them. I, for one, am part of the latter faction.
11095 : Why're you giving me a dumb old rod?
11096 : If you should give this to anyone, it should be the Inventors' Coalition. They're the only ones who'd be able to fix it.
11097 : That's a sword foot soldiers wielded during the insurrection that occurred around the year 350.
11098 : During the time when colonization was forbidden, each order desperately tried to exert their dominance over the others, resulting in unprecedented bloodshed.
11099 : What? You want me to apprrraise a painting? An odd request, for sure, but I think I'm up to it.
11100 : Nhili Uvolep stares at the painting % with a discerning eye.
11101 : Sorry, but you got the fur pulled over your eyes. It's an incontrrrovertible fake.
11102 : If only it were rrreal, you'd be set for life.
11103 : I knew you'd do me proud, but I never thought you'd amass such a treasure trove of information!
11104 : Let's get down to business uncovering the impetuses for the Great Expedition, then!
11105 : First on the docket is this %. The title has enough gravitas in it to crush Sunrise Beacon, so I bet it's incredibly significant. What do you think?
11106 : This % thingy! It looks important, too, right?
11107 : You feel an ethereal grip upon your throat that prevents you from speaking.
11108 : Sounds like a case of If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything. Okay, out it goes. Next!
11109 : Someone slow the airship to pessimismville! You're either the most negative person I've met in my life or you're trying to pull my leg. Trying being the operative word here.
11110 : Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me again and...well, you're not gonna fool me again! Let's start over from the top...and be serious this time!
11111 : In the year 350, a deep-seated conflict over political control of the archipelago erupted, embroiling each of the Adoulinian orders.
11112 : The founder king's last words to his people began to lose their efficacy circa Crystal Era 400. Though the populace once deathly feared entering the jungle, they then declared that colonization would begin anew.
11113 : The year was Crystal Era 405. After the ban on entering the Ulbukan hinterland was lifted, a certain artist gathered his tools of the trade and marched into the heart of the jungle. Once there, he became enamored with the local flora--one gargantuan tree in particular--and thus painted one of the most vivid and influential scenes in the history of the west.
11114 : After departing on a long and arduous journey across multiple continents and laying eyes upon myriad wonders, Sverdhried finally managed to make landfall in Adoulin sometime during the first half of the fifth century.
11115 : Coinciding with the advancement of the colonization effort and the advent of Crystal Era 550, the earth began to shake mightily at irregular intervals. Fissures gaped wide and whole topographical features were reformed when these manifestations of terric vengeance struck.
11116 : In the year 607, domesticated giant sheep were exported to the Middle Lands in hope of both diversifying its breadbasket and enhancing Adoulin's mercantile prowess.
11117 : Records exist of a baffling incident where not just one tree, but whole swaths of woodlands matured over the course of a single nightfall in the early part of the seventh century. Certain academics hold that the event described within such documents is specious at best, but their sheer volume leads most to believe their veracity.
11118 : 879 is cited as the year in which produce cultivation first began within the Civic Arboretum. Harnessing the power of irrigation, which was made possible thanks to its location in the Rala Waterways, Adoulinian researchers have been able to raise crops that help alleviate the food shortage plaguing this municipality.
11119 : Duplicates of a painting considered almost sacrosanct by the art community infiltrated the market starting in 883. While extremely faithful to the original's depiction of a colossal tree guarding the Ulbukan frontier, the condition of the paints used and the type of brush strokes employed make it easy to discern their lack of authenticity.
11120 : Multiple people have spotted a cryptic male patronizing the Mummers' Coalition throughout the year 884. Who he is and why he spends so much time at a house of amusement remain a mystery, and perhaps will for eternity.
11121 : How's that sound to you?
11122 : I'd go so far as to say that it's the pinnacle of relevancy and eon-defining aural ecstasy. Eon-defining being the operative word here.
11123 : How's it sound to you? Like a faithful rendition of a sonata. Like a discordant cacophony.
11124 : R-really!? I truly thought I had something there. Well, let's go back to the drawing board in a bit.
11125 : I'm glad to hear we're on the same page, hohoho! Let me pass this on to the Couriers' Coalition and we'll be good to go. If only I knew exactly who my employer was, I could send it directly, but...
11126 : Who cares about where I get my money from, as long as it's enough to make Yocile swoon for me!
11127 : Oops, I almost forgot that you played a minor role in making me into the happiest man in the world. Minor being the operative word here. This'll have to suffice for now.
11128 : I'll give you the rest of your share when that ludicrously lucrative reward arrives.
11129 : Once I get my hands on it, Yocile's got no choice but to fall in love with me. Who's the man? I'm the man!
11130 : Oh, fate, thou art a cruel and terrible mistress!
11131 : %, listen to this! There I was, planning out the route I would take my beloved Yocile on--like any chivalrous gent would...
11132 : ...Then I happened upon a true beauty from the Mummers' Coalition.
11133 : When I finally came to, I hadn't a pinch of bayld to my name!
11134 : That's how the trail cookie crumbles, you know. Easy come, easy go and all that. I'll pay you back someday, though, I swear!
11135 : My physical thirst may have been quenched, but my heart's still drier than Flaviria's wit.
11136 : Hey there, %. Boy, are you ever gonna laugh when you hear this.
11137 : So, I was minding my own business in the bushes the other day when I <ha ha> saw Yocile taking a stroll with some guy. They were arm-in-arm, mind you!
11138 : Of course I couldn't just go up and ask her out in that situation, so get this <ha ha>...I let them pass <ha ha> without saying a word... <Sniffle>
11139 : <Sigh> I know you don't care about my plight, so let's talk money.
11140 : You might notice there's less than promised. That's because I went on a little spending spree to cheer myself up.
11141 : It did make me feel a little better, though. You know what? Material possessions be damned! Take all the bayld I have!
11142 : Perhaps it's time I got back on the proverbial chocobo and gave it another go.
11143 : You'll rue the day you ever met me if you tell a single person about you-know-what.
11144 : If it isn't my favorite pioneer, unsurprisingly come to grace me with [his/her] presence! And since you're here, if I may ask...
11145 : You wound me with that dour look! Have you forgotten all we've been through, you and I?
11146 : Of course you haven't! Why else would you appear so fortuitously by my side?
11147 : You know what I'm thinking about. Thinking being the operative word here.
11148 : How do you respond? Aha. Huh? Still thirsty? No clue.
11149 : Yes! That's the [man/woman] I've grown to trust!
11150 : Why, the same as always, my friend! We must investigate vestiges of the past...together!
11151 : Hmph. I was being intentionally vague, so as to let the listener draw [his/her] own conclusions, thinking [he/she] would so dutifully accept my request...
11152 : H-hey! Get those legs of yours back here! I take it all back--just please, hear me out!
11153 : Y-you have already procured...!? Why, I, uh, don't know what to say.
11154 : D-don't worry. I promise not to make you cajole Yocile in my stead this time. This time being the operative phrase here.
11155 : No, I wish you to hear my tale and let the story play out as it will.
11156 : C-could it be that my sixth sense has failed me?
11157 : The project I'm working on is of much import--it concerns the founder king and his generals.
11158 : Think of the ramifications! We could unveil the truth behind Adoulin's most storied myths and legends!
11159 : It certainly sounds like a pretty affair, but with every light comes a shadow. You'd sooner stumble upon an even-tempered Velkk than chance upon tales of indisputable veracity.
11160 : ...Or so one would think. I, however, happen to have come prepared.
11161 : This amazing %, specially made by the Inventors' Coalition, has the ability to view snippets of the past.
11162 : Tell me--doesn't that news set your heart aflutter?
11163 : There's just one itsy-bitsy bump in the road...
11164 : How do you respond? Bump? What kind of bump? Just get to the point.
11165 : This peddler of old curios was raving about the wonders of this odd machine, you see? Who could pass up such a marvel? So I paid the king's ransom he was asking.
11166 : It was only later that I realized--the thing didn't come with any sort of manual!
11167 : Visions of the past are supposed to come floating to your mind like petals on the wind, but no matter how many times I open and close it or flip it on its side, it remains just what it seems--an old wooden box!
11168 : Ugh. Long story short...
11169 : I have no idea how to use it!
11170 : Since I can't make heads or tails of this stupid contraption, I'll let you borrow it. Mayhap you will have that stroke of luck that has thus far eluded me.
11171 : Which brings me to a word of advice: remember that daft young girl from before? The one under the Scouts' Coalition's employ? Perhaps start with her.
11172 : Huh? Why don't I go myself?
11173 : Well, uh...y-you see... I don't think she and I...
11174 : Oh, come now! There's no one more suited to the job than you!
11175 : After all, we've worked together on multiple occasions. Not even the sky can limit you, my friend!
11176 : And look over there--even the Goddess herself is smiling upon you! O, praise be to Altana, may She deliver unto % the secrets of this box!
11177 : See? Altana and I believe in you. Altana being the operative word here.
11178 : Now, be off! I shan't keep you from your calling any longer!
11179 : You find yourself in a terrible pickle.
11180 : The first order of business is to figure out how that % works. I'd start with the odd girl at the Scouts' Coalition.
11181 : Wh-wh-what are you doing here? Haven't you badgered me enough for one lifetime?
11182 : Or do you intend to haunt me even after I cross over!?
11183 : A...wooden box? What do you expect me to do with this?
11184 : Hmm... Most likely %.
11185 : Isn't this one of those devices the Inventors' Coalition came up with? The kind that can recall the past?
11186 : I'll be blunt. I find it disturbing that out of all the people here in Adoulin, you choose to discuss this with me. What exactly are you looking for?
11187 : What topic are you interested in? The life and times of King August. The life and times of Palomel. Last night's dinner.
11188 : D-dinner? You come all the way over here with an expensive instrument to inquire about my gastronomic tendencies!?
11189 : Do you know how many sleepless nights I have spent cringing at events from my youth? Can you even fathom how much people would suffer if mistakes from their childhood were recorded for all eternity!?
11190 : Hmm... The life and times of King August...
11191 : H-huh!?
11192 : K-K-K-K-King August?
11193 : Did those Velkk over in Marjami Ravine give you a few too many whacks on the head!? There's the past and there's ancient history, and I think we both know where that falls on the spectrum!
11194 : We're talking centuries here, not decades!
11195 : W-wait. I may have remembered something.
11196 : I overheard some tosspot talking about peering into the past by projecting her mind into the future; something about refractive energies...
11197 : I can't vouch for this queer Mithra's skills, but she claims to see the future. Although, er, it's only thirty seconds or so.
11198 : What, you think that sounds crazy? You're trying to see the past using only a wooden box, what else did you expect...?
11199 : Assuming my memory hasn't checked out for the week, a young mithra who can see thirty seconds into the future might be able to provide insight into using the %.
11200 : A Mithra with the ability to peer thirty seconds into the future?
11201 : Ah, yes--I think I know a geomancer matching her description.
11202 : Come to think of it, I haven't seen her slinking about town lately. Do you suppose she might be on holiday?
11203 : Huh? You wanna know where to use that %?
11204 : <Sigh> Well, we know a lot about our great king, don't we? So I'd say to try looking in...
11205 : Yup. That should just about do it.
11206 : %. I can't think of anywhere else to look.
11207 : Why're you still bothering me? Get out there and search!
11208 : Sure took your sweet time. Did you get anywhere flipping loose stones?
11209 : Well, get a load of--
11210 : Hehehehehe.
11211 : Ahahahahaha!!!
11212 : Excellent!
11213 : Well, this certainly beats out my admittedly meager expectations.
11214 : Who goes there!?
11215 : Twenty-five years old. Single. A quarrel with his father sent him scurrying to the shadows of Western Adoulin, where he makes a pittance as a two-bit private investigator.
11216 : Struck out with the ladies seven times, of whom two he actually finagled into first dates. Tends to seek women who...
11217 : S-stop your blathering! What do you have against me that you come spouting such filth?
11218 : Ah. Maester Margret. Have you come to hurl insults at me like some cheap wench throwing a patron out of some seedy tavern?
11219 : I'd have expected a more deferential greeting from someone who, I assume, does not wish to become persona non grata at my coalition.
11220 : I'm here not to throw barbs. Quite the opposite. Your current research intrigues me, and I would like to inquire about your methods.
11221 : What're you playing at!?
11222 : You've used this pioneer for your own ends to catch glimpses into the very beginnings of this sacred city.
11223 : But something troubles me...
11224 : You know as well as the rest of us that the Celennia Memorial Library houses every tome, encyclopedia, and treatise ever written on Adoulinian soil.
11225 : A simple kind word to Andreine and you would be swimming in knowledge.
11226 : Despite this, you employ a pioneer to hunt and peck through Adoulin and outlying areas for vestiges of the past.
11227 : The only logical conclusion is that what you seek is not contained within the library's halls. Hence, you sought the help of one who could move freely about Eastern Ulbuka.
11228 : Yet one does not simply stumble upon discoveries concerning events from more than one hundred years prior--especially if such information falls under the purview of the Scouts' Coalition.
11229 : And without any solid leads to go on...well, let's just say your pioneer friend would clearly lose interest.
11230 : So you came up with a brilliant plan.
11231 : If you can't find facts, what harm could there be in making some of your own?
11232 : What're you implying?
11233 : I'll cut to the quick. The seeds of information % found--you sowed them yourself.
11234 : And when they bloomed, you made sure that [he/she] was there to reap the harvest.
11235 : H-h-he was cheating me the whole time!?
11236 : But why go to all the trouble? Because you hoped [he/she] would find something fresh along the way.
11237 : You think yourself clever, don't you?
11238 : But I saw right through you, Roskin. So I chose to...inject myself into your affairs.
11239 : D-did you tamper...
11240 : This % in particular...your craftsmanship was quite impressive. Yet it was also your downfall.
11241 : Anyone could check it out from the library, but you chose to give a fake name when you did so. Did you expect the Scouts' Coalition to be fooled by such blatant fraud?
11242 : Which brings me to another point--I was so inspired by your efforts that I inserted a code into your props.
11243 : Yes, I refer to the % in %'s possession.
11244 : Why don't you try your hand at it?
11245 : Mayhap some hints are in order.
11246 : Organize your findings by year and look for clues: anything which seems out of place.
11247 : After that is done, count the number of people that know the answer, and move each up by one.
11248 : Follow these, and the truth will be made manifest.
11249 : I believe you are already intimately familiar with the answer...though it has changed from what it once was.
11250 : %, however, had no trouble deciphering the true meaning.
11251 : But I digress.
11252 : I deem that the records [he/she] has collected are of considerable historic interest.
11253 : Let me ask--what do you intend to do with this information?
11254 : ... Hahaha!
11255 : You don't realize, do you, Margret? No, it's not that you don't...it's that you can't.
11256 : You've completely forgotten that the two of us were once classmates.
11257 : It never mattered how much I worked or how much I struggled. You always took top honors.
11258 : Do you know what it's like to put forth your mightiest effort and realize that it was all for naught!?
11259 : You were always a step ahead, you damn...!
11260 : You haven't the slightest inkling of what it feels like to lose!!!
11261 : Hmph. And now you want my valuable information? I'll bet you do.
11262 : The hallowed Scouts' Coalition, renowned as the premier source of information...has failed in its mission to piece together relics of the past.
11263 : But not me! I alone have found the truth!
11264 : I could ruin your career with but one visit to the Adoulin Examiner.
11265 : Picture the headline, in bold font splayed across the front page--Scouts' Coalition One-Upped by the Intrepid Roskin!
11266 : You'd be the laughingstock of the twelve orders--no, of all Adoulin!
11267 : And then, after all these years...
11268 : I would be the winner!!!
11269 : <Whirr whirr whirr>... <Click>
11270 : ...And so, I would like to extend an offer to join the Scouts' Coalition.
11271 : Of course, one of your talents would receive proper remuneration. Our terms are generous, and I trust you find this offer tempting...
11272 : Of course! I would be honored to serve under one such as yourself!
11273 : Geez, she sure read you like a book!
11274 : Hmm... Believing the source without confirming its credibility... I'll have to dock you twenty points.
11275 : Y-you are going to hire me, right?
11276 : Ha ha ha! You're giving me second thoughts...
11277 : But be that as it may, your first duty is to recompense % for [his/her] efforts.
11278 : My calling as a custodian of history is now a reality--and I owe it all to your superlative actions. Superlative being the operative word here.
11279 : I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
11280 : Good to see you again, %! I may be a member of the Scouts' Coalition now, yet I am quite certain I will have need of your talents in the future!
11281 : M-Maester Margret....
11282 : Palomel, you've been shaking all day. It bothers you, too, doesn't it?
11283 : It's hard to put into words, but... How can you place your faith and trust in that common gutter trash?
11284 : Ha ha ha! So that's what's been eating at you?
11285 : In the end, what does it matter?
11286 : I-I'm afraid I don't...
11287 : I had assumed you were referring to the records % brought back with [him/her].
11288 : There's more than a passing chance that they aren't facts to be trusted wholesale, but rather extrapolations based on [his/her] assumptions.
11289 : So do I think [he/she] bore witness to history as it happened? No.
11290 : Only one thing should be of interest to us as true purveyors of knowledge.
11291 : Physical evidence that leads us to undeniable conclusions.
11292 : That information goes beyond stories and old wives' tales, and something about it just feels right.
11293 : But even if we wanted to prove or refute it, how could we?
11294 : Still, there's a voice inside telling me that it's...
11295 : Maester...
11296 : Hmph. Listen to me, blabbing on about intuition.
11297 : How unbecoming.
11298 : Margret's code? That's what's been bugging you?
11299 : Oh, for the love of... Let me see if I remember.
11300 : Hmm hmm hmmmmmm... If I recall, you had to organize those strange letters in chronological order.
11301 : That would put the order at... Jt AoWv WhAt JvJo Jt. What does that even mean?
11302 : And, uh, you have to count the number of people that know the answer, and move each up by one once you've solved the first hint.
11303 : What're you looking at me like that for!? It's your riddle, you solve it!
11304 : This thirst...oh, if only there were someone to release me from this parched prison!
11305 : Do my eyes deceive me, or is that %? Thank goodness you have seen fit to come to me this fine day, for I have need of a friendly ear.
11306 : No, no, it's not about Yocile, but rather the Scouts' Coalition. My first task as an official member is to collate the records you found for me into an informative discourse...an article, if you will.
11307 : Maester Margret assured me that my work would be enshrined forever in Celennia Memorial Library.
11308 : That means that these very hands will write the history that our children's children will learn! Absolutely wonderful, no?
11309 : How do you respond? Wow. Yay. Nice.
11310 : But in order to pen an epic that will be talked about for generations, I need a certain volume of special import. Import being the operative word here.
11311 : As such, I have a task for you.
11312 : Make haste for Celennia Memorial Library and procure Heroes and Legends of Adoulin for me.
11313 : This should be a piece of proverbial cake compared to the trials I put before you up until now. Just go there and mention that the one and only Roskin sent you.
11314 : Enjoy!
11315 : This is the specimen I required?
11316 : Oho! A transcribed copy? Libraries certainly are filled with marvels, no? Let me take a quick look...
11317 : It...really is what I asked for!
11318 : I had heard such rumors, of course, but of all the people to get their hands on it! How much bayld did you have to slip Oshasha?
11319 : Let me get a quick peek...
11320 : ... This volume piques my curiosity nearly as much as the records you brought back!
11321 : It will revolutionize the way we view August's initial foray into the hinterlands!
11322 : I might have to stop by the coalition and grab a few more vials of ink!
11323 : Some may view the fervor I have for my work to be off-putting, but hopefully you view it as one of my more endearing qualities.
11324 : Now, to put quill to parchment!
11325 : %! My latest masterpiece is complete!
11326 : I will be scrubbing wax off my desk for days...but that's a small price to pay for academic inspiration.
11327 : In fact, your presence brings a smile to my face. As Margret promised, a copy of my work has been delivered to Celennia Memorial Library.
11328 : I can hear your heart beating from here! Stop by and bear witness to my genius!
11329 : I must admit that I owe you so much. Let me think of a proper way to repay you.
11330 : ...Ah! I know just the thing. A transcription of this fascinating volume I chanced upon the other day.
11331 : And please, permit me to give you a little something special, too.
11332 : I shall repay my monumental debt over time, so be sure to say hello every so often when your travels bring you nearby.
11333 : Don't bother me.
11334 : Hey.
11335 : You're %, yes?
11336 : What is your response? Yes, I am. You've got the wrong [guy/gal].
11337 : I see. Never mind.
11338 : Here. This is for you.
11339 : I know Margret will find the truth.
11340 : I've kept you waiting, haven't I?
11341 : The whole thing has me in a bit of a tizzy, too. Don't you think it's odd?
11342 : Whoops! I've put the cart before the chocobo.
11343 : You've removed Adoulin's most immediate threat, but...
11344 : When his corpse was hauled back from Kamihr Drifts, I felt there was something...amiss.
11345 : Melvien was most certainly dead.
11346 : That's something beyond all doubt.
11347 : But then he returned.
11348 : How can one doubt what they've seen with their own two eyes?
11349 : But we've got a pile of dirt to clean up first before we go digging for the root of that mystery.
11350 : Something...someone...
11351 : ...killed Melvien.
11352 : To hear the other maesters and ministers tell it, he died at the claws of some ferocious beasts, but I know they're mistaken.
11353 : While they averted their eyes, I took the opportunity to examine the corpse.
11354 : What rended his flesh was no monster. The incisions were too precise for that.
11355 : And his body was found hidden away, as if someone didn't want it to be found... No, this was the work of human hands.
11356 : But we lack concrete information, so we'll have to thread the needle to prove my hypothesis.
11357 : But that hasn't stopped me from making my own inroads.
11358 : Persons of interest in this curious affair have clammed up, claiming the incident to have long been settled.
11359 : Normally a carrot and stick approach works to loosen up their tongues, but people have grown wary of the Scouts' Coalition of late.
11360 : So that's where someone a bit more detached from the situation--a pioneer--comes in.
11361 : Yes, %, I'm talking about you. Their guard won't be as high if you're the one asking the questions.
11362 : It goes without saying that the coalition is beyond willing to recompense you for your efforts.
11363 : So, what do you say? Can I enlist your aid?
11364 : Will you assist Margret? I'll do all I can. This is none of my concern.
11365 : You're not under my authority, so I can't force you.
11366 : I'll see what we can turn up in the meantime, but your assistance would be appreciated should you change your mind.
11367 : I'd still like your assistance in discovering the truth behind Melvien's death. Can I count on you?
11368 : Excellent.
11369 : There's one person in particular who's been giving me the runaround.
11370 : Estienneux, former aide to Melvien and acting minister of finance. He's a member of the Order of Woltaris and can often be found near their manse near the Coronal Esplanade.
11371 : ...Ah, I almost forgot to give you something.
11372 : Here.
11373 : It's a portrait of Melvien I drew myself.
11374 : I've no idea whether or not it'll be of any use...
11375 : But who knows? Everyone knows his name, but not everyone would recognize him on the street. Perhaps it'll help jog their memories.
11376 : Next we meet, it'll be on the right side of truth.
11377 : Head to Melvien's estate near the Coronal Esplanade to meet with Estienneux.
11378 : Anything you'd like to do? Ask for Melvien. Ask for Estienneux. Leave.
11379 : I presumed you knew, but...Melvien has passed-wassed on. Oh, to go at such a young age...
11380 : Wait. You are...
11381 : %. Permitaru me to check his schedule.
11382 : He will see you. Let me show you in.
11383 : Ah, it certainly has been many weeks since we last met. Estienneux, aide to the minister of finance, at your service.
11384 : We all have heard how you saved Adoulin from ruin. Though these words doubtless have graced your ears so much they now ring false, thank you.
11385 : Your assistance in procuring the requisite materials for crafting % was invaluable in helping keep our economy afloat.
11386 : Should there be anything you require, you only need name it.
11387 : What do you ask? You're still an aide? Tell me about Melvien when he was alive. Show him the %.
11388 : Ah, I thought you might inquire about that.
11389 : Melvien's most untimely death led to a vacancy in the order, and I have been called upon to act in his stead until such time as a suitable replacement may be found.
11390 : But my position is only for external purposes.
11391 : The monumental volume of work he was able to handle himself is beyond compare, and his duties are now divided amongst several of us.
11392 : I have chosen to retain my old title until such a time that I am able to stand of my own accord.
11393 : Interestingly, Melvien always had a penchant for delving into old tomes of various origins.
11394 : Naturally, he was quite the patron of Celennia Memorial Library.
11395 : I am told it was a fascination for him ever since his childhood, but I never imagined that his thirst for knowledge would...
11396 : Ah--please forgive me. You came for facts, not opinions.
11397 : O-oh my...
11398 : This certainly is a powerful work, but...is that Melvien? ...Huh.
11399 : Ah, yes, I can recognize from the sharpness of the lines that this was drawn by none other than the lady Margret.
11400 : This must be from when Melvien was still a student of letters.
11401 : He quite enjoyed a war game-esque novelty about pioneering developed by none other than the present-day Scouts' Coalition maester.
11402 : He was fascinated by the way it represented historically accurate scenarios, and was said to have spent many hours playing it each night before retiring to his chamber.
11403 : That is how I recognized the work. It bears the same hallmarks as the illustrations that came with the game itself. Stark imagery, to be sure.
11404 : That does jog my memory. It must have been around the same time...
11405 : Melvien accompanied his father, Souffriand, then the minister of finance, on a minor expedition into the Ulbuka hinterlands.
11406 : It was clear that Melvien would one day be at the forefront of the order, and he was to venture out as part of his coming-of-age ritual.
11407 : Yet misfortune befell the two, as Souffriand perished in a survey-related accident.
11408 : Melvien's personality took a one-hundred-eighty-degree turn in the aftermath.
11409 : He had always been so bright and carefree, but with each passing day his previously smiling visage became increasingly marred with depression and doubt.
11410 : Could I honestly say I would have fared better were it I who witnessed the passing of my father firsthand?
11411 : Ah, I remember now...
11412 : The lady who was sworn to protect the two continues to serve the Couriers' Coalition to this very day.
11413 : Perhaps Maester Reginald would be able to answer that which I cannot.
11414 : His manor is located behind the Couriers' Coalition in Western Adoulin.
11415 : You scribble down information regarding %.
11416 : Head to Reginald's manor behind the Couriers' Coalition in Western Adoulin.
11417 : Oooh hooo hooo. Now why would the ley lines lead me here?
11418 : Aaah, yes. This is getting interesting.
11419 : I would be concerned, [son/daughter] of man. Everyone is equal before the door to truth.
11420 : You must twist the knob and see what lies beyond.
11421 : A note appears to have been left here for you.
11422 : Perhaps you should read %.
11423 : Ah, I knew I'd find you here.
11424 : First, though, a word of thanks.
11425 : If I'd truly been suspected of murder, I--
11426 : Well, one mystery has been cleared up, but I still have questions.
11427 : M-Maester Margret!?
11428 : Tell me, Estelle.
11429 : My task for you was to investigate Melvien's past, was it not?
11430 : ...It was. But when I heard that some opponents of colonization were looking to frame you, I...
11431 : Aha. The pieces are coming together.
11432 : But impersonating another--and a maester, at that--is a serious crime under Adoulinian law.
11433 : You understand what that means.
11434 : I do.
11435 : You will be punished once this incident has been cleared up.
11436 : ...Of course.
11437 : Fine. Return to the coalition.
11438 : You were involved in the entire debacle, %. Tell me what transpired.
11439 : Let me take a look.
11440 : This report details what you learned from Estienneux, correct?
11441 : So then the Couriers' Coalition...
11442 : Oho! Maester Reginald?
11443 : Then this was all the work of [Morimar/a man named Morimar].
11444 : This completes that step of the puzzle. We should be able to press on, now.
11445 : What you've discovered might mesh perfectly with my theory. What theory? I'm glad you asked.
11446 : Melvien...was not Hades. Rather, Hades was pretending to be Melvien.
11447 : It was an act of possession, if you will.
11448 : Let's presume for a moment that its consciousness invaded the body of our former minister of finance.
11449 : That would raise the obvious question, no?
11450 : Is such a thing even possible?
11451 : I have been hung up there for the longest time. I am a woman who requires evidence, not conjecture.
11452 : I've run my fingers through every applicable tome and turned up empty at every corner.
11453 : That gleam in your eye--you know something, don't you?
11454 : How do you respond? Explain about monipulator possession. Show your %.
11455 : Possessing a monster...? Becoming a monipulator and battling gladiators?
11456 : You lost me.
11457 : Ah! I think I understand. One can pass their consciousness through such a ring and come to possess another.
11458 : That would be quite the feat...but there is no reason for you to stretch the truth.
11459 : The wonders of the Middle Lands never cease.
11460 : A bolt of lightning. A miraculous recovery. A sudden change in personality.
11461 : Melvien lashing out.
11462 : Fremilla. Possession. Balamor.
11463 : Chero-Machero falling unconscious before our very eyes.
11464 : The soul siphon. A stolen spirit.
11465 : It's all coming together. If we assume that Melvien really did die that day...
11466 : ...Then Hades took that opportunity to breathe new life into him.
11467 : Hm? No, there's something else.
11468 : Let's posit your conclusion is true. For such a thing to be possible, someone must have made it so.
11469 : But...who?
11470 : Check up on Estelle behind the Scouts' Coalition.
11471 : Oh, it's you, %.
11472 : I was expecting Margret to bang the gavel of justice right on my head.
11473 : She asked me to gather 100 %. Her bark remains worse than her bite.
11474 : But when all was said and done...she thanked me.
11475 : You did me proud by doing Melvien justice.
11476 : Truth be told, I was more concerned for Margret than Melvien.
11477 : Your contributions went above and beyond in helping solve this case. Margret gave me a reward for you...and I added a little something on top.
11478 : But in return, I would, uh...like that portrait that Margret drew.
11479 : ...And while I'm at it, do you still have that letter I used to bring you two together?
11480 : We had used it as a cipher of sorts.
11481 : A hidden message appears when you submerge it in a particular type of acid.
11482 : The path from here on is for you to decide.
11483 : Good day, %. I trust Adoulin is treating you well?
11484 : Ah, my [dependable/lovely] assistant! You couldn't have come at a more opportune time.
11485 : We've scoured the annals of history, you and I. The secrets of the founder king that we unearthed have rewritten how the city views his entire life!
11486 : But despite all that...despite all the inroads we've made, there's something that bothers me. <Nudge> You know what I mean.
11487 : What grand mystery remains? Who cares? The workings of the imprint device S. Who exactly made all the requests. Your personality disorder. Palomel's younger days. The royal fiat banning colonization.
11488 : Did those oh-so-many days we spent poring over documents and examining long-lost memories mean nothing to you!? Come on, let's work through this!
11489 : Hmmm... You do raise an interesting point.
11490 : But I'd file that under curiosity, not mystery.
11491 : We can worry about that later. There's something a bit more pressing to focus on first...
11492 : Come, now! This is a time for delving into the truth, not blabbering on about something of minimal import!
11493 : That's exactly the chord I've been looking to strike!
11494 : We cross paths once more at this most important of times. Is this serendipity? Fate? Nay...
11495 : Necessity!
11496 : The Goddess herself has charged us with solving this most cryptic of riddles.
11497 : And the operative word here...
11498 : ...is us. And by us, I mean you.
11499 : ...Right.
11500 : ...Hulking, lumbering you.
11501 : How do you react? Let's barrel in headfirst, then. You got sawdust for brains?
11502 : Ah, but giving up is fully unbecoming of you! The % I know would not be content leaving stones to gather moss!
11503 : Come, %! Altana has charged us with figuring out who's behind the whole shebang!
11504 : And I could think of no one better to be my beast of burden!
11505 : A good sleuth has [his/her] facts in order before sniffing out suspects. While I'm compiling information to go on, you should...
11506 : You should...
11507 : Well, you should get started at the Inventors' Coalition. And bring the % with you.
11508 : If anyone can put that wreck back together, it's them.
11509 : Chop-chop!
11510 : Someone at the Inventors' Coalition could spruce up the % for you. In the meantime, I'll be here following some leads.
11511 : Hmm...I smell a rat.
11512 : Ah, %. Impeccable timing, as I've come to expect.
11513 : I've combed over every last detail, and my gut is clenched tighter than a steel vise.
11514 : You've stumbled onto a veritable treasure trove these past few weeks, all thanks to my stellar guidance. Stellar being the operative word here.
11515 : But perchance all this time we've been made to dance in someone else's hands.
11516 : Think about it. We haven't the faintest who exactly set us on this trail.
11517 : You've crossed the boundaries of time and gleaned information about the founder king's era that no one could ever have hoped to recover.
11518 : And how did you do that? By using that imprint device I got for a pittance from some old peddler.
11519 : A peddler who claimed he procured it from someone in the Scouts' Coalition.
11520 : Not the Inventors' Coalition--the Scouts' Coalition. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
11521 : Who's the suspicious one? Roskin. Margret. Me. Lola.
11522 : To tell the truth, that was my initial thought, but then I realized...
11523 : ...How preposterous the idea was.
11524 : Our first meeting was--dare I say it--serendipity, and it was well after I had received the initial request.
11525 : As if that weren't enough to exonerate you, there's one other thing: you took the trouble of gathering the evidence yourself. Your motives and actions don't mesh with that theory.
11526 : H-huh? Just because she looks wrinkled doesn't mean she's part of the Blackthorn Coven!
11527 : You're saying that geomantic energies may have had something to do with it?
11528 : You say...there're residual memories of those who touched the device on it? So you saw...my consciousness?
11529 : I, uh...um... Wh-what did you see?
11530 : Well that's a couple steps beyond astonishing, to say the least.
11531 : So you saw me yelling at Margret and throwing a huge hissy fit?
11532 : Whaaaaaaaaat!?
11533 : Th-this has to stay strictly between the two of us. Got it?
11534 : How do you respond? Your secret's safe with me. Your secret's safe with the populace.
11535 : Please, %, I'm begging you!
11536 : <Sigh> Goddess be good...
11537 : What Margret doesn't know can't hurt her, right? Know being the operative word here.
11538 : Hmm... Mayhap there is no other answer.
11539 : I've heard everything--including that the two of you were investigating Adoulin's past.
11540 : Yes, I was the one who turned the imprint device over to that poor sod and bid him sell it to you.
11541 : Then the pieces fall into place... But why would you do such a thing?
11542 : You'll have to forgive my deception, but it was necessary as part of an ongoing investigation I was conducting.
11543 : I used your forays into history in an attempt to glean whatever clues I could.
11544 : You see, many moons ago, there was a colleague of mine, several years older but not a touch more intelligent.
11545 : He had been searching for Palomel's parents, and just when he had stumbled upon a lead...he vanished.
11546 : I took charge of the case afterwards, mind you...
11547 : But by then, the trail had run cold. And so here I stand today, empty-handed and without a compass to guide me.
11548 : I was thirteen at the time, and twelve years have passed since then...and don't even think about counting the years to deduce information best left unsaid.
11549 : But Roskin, you and % have discovered a great deal in your little adventures.
11550 : Yet instead of bearing fruit, it's done nothing but wither on the vine.
11551 : I...see.
11552 : ...Hang on. There's something fishy...
11553 : The imprint device only displays images and memories of those who've touched it, right?
11554 : And we know that only four people had access to it--you, me, %, and the peddler.
11555 : But if we assume that %'s story is true, and Palomel appeared in the vision as well...
11556 : Uh-oh!
11557 : Palomel snatches the %!
11558 : What on Vana'diel!?
11559 : Aha. She used one of our coalition's transportation runes...and the latent energies imply that she headed to Yorcia Weald.
11560 : The only question is why...
11561 : I had to go without desserts for two months to get ahold of that device!
11562 : We've gotta get it back!
11563 : %, we've got to head to Yorcia Weald to take back the %!
11564 : Maester Margret mentioned that the runes were attuned to the second frontier bivouac.
11565 : Hahaha... I trashed that stupid thing...
11566 : ...And now I don't know anything. Don't feel or see anything.
11567 : Whose memories are those?
11568 : Give them back!
11569 : Give me back my memories!!!
11570 : I know that dour look on your face. You couldn't get my imprint device back, could you?
11571 : I was afraid of that.
11572 : You've...you've seen something. Share it with me.
11573 : Balamor? Wonder who that guy could be. So what did this Balamor do? What happened to him?
11574 : What do you mean, you can't remember!? Someone replaced that watertight head of yours with a sieve?
11575 : Hmm. Even if you did remember, it wouldn't explain why Palomel ran off with the device in the first place.
11576 : Funny, isn't it? We've glimpsed into the most storied memories of Adoulin's past, and now the thing that concerns me the most is Palomel's.
11577 : But what am I supposed to do? Stroll over there and say, Hey, so about that imprint device...?
11578 : Palomel, calm down!
11579 : But I know--I know I'm forgetting something!
11580 : I've got to remember. I've just got to!
11581 : I grabbed the device in hopes that it would show me something.
11582 : But all I saw was a kaleidoscope of strange butterflies and a man I didn't recognize.
11583 : I know that butterflies mean something, but my knees turned to jelly and I couldn't go any farther.
11584 : I don't understand... I don't understand any of this.
11585 : I-I figured if the device helped us unravel the history of our fair city it would be able to do the same for me.
11586 : But in the end, I learned nothing.
11587 : Every time I reach out for the truth, it pulls further away. Why? Why!?
11588 : I've got nothing. I'm all alone.
11589 : All alone, with no one to take care of me or wipe away my tears when I cry.
11590 : But that's fine. I've always been b-by myself. I don't need anyone.
11591 : Palomel!
11592 : I've always thought of you as my sister. We might not be related by blood, and it's true that you may never find that kind of solace.
11593 : But I need you to listen.
11594 : The Order of Haverton took you in when you wandered into town dazed and confused, and not long after my parents gave birth to me.
11595 : Don't turn your back on all the days we spent together in our youth.
11596 : I still think of you as my sister, and will continue to do so. Always.
11597 : You're not alone. You've got me and the members of the Scouts' Coalition.
11598 : As long as I serve as the coalition's maester, the search for your parents shall never cease.
11599 : You'll remember one day, Palomel. I swear to you.
11600 : <Sniff>
11601 : Until then, everyone at the coalition is your family.
11602 : And we'll never abandon you.
11603 : Th-that's right! Never fear, Palomel, Roskin is here!
11604 : But, uh, don't expect the two of us to get hitched. My heart belongs to a fair maiden known as Yocile, and I could have eyes for no other.
11605 : Roskin...
11606 : Hm?
11607 : Guys like you make me want to vomit!!!
11608 : D-d-does Roskin think I'm some two-bit strumpet who'd throw herself at the feet of a narcissistic cretin like him!?
11609 : S-sorry for my earlier outburst. I should be more thankful.
11610 : I'll be fine--I promise.
11611 : Could it be...could it be that I was too frivolous with Palomel?
11612 : Was he too frivolous? Understatement of the year. She was just overreacting.
11613 : Right. I thought she was too. Still, the way the veins popped out of her forehead makes me wonder if I should apologize...
11614 : R-really? Well...the way the veins popped out of her forehead makes me wonder if I should apologize...
11615 : I'd advise against it. Don't toss oil on a burning fire.
11616 : Margret!?
11617 : My sis...Palomel...was the one who started you on the path of discovery to begin with. Not me.
11618 : And now that the truth's out there--and that we've come to trust each other a bit--I'll make sure that we ask you directly instead of going through hidden channels.
11619 : As such, you deserve proper recompense for all the hard work you've done.
11620 : I have two rewards in thanks. This %, a treasure passed down from the Order of Haverton since time immemorial, and a monetary payment of # bayld. I'll leave it to you to decide who gets which.
11621 : Really? I can decide?
11622 : I was addressing %. After all, isn't [he/she] the most capable assistant you could have asked for?
11623 : Which would you like? The %. The # bayld.
11624 : Then so it shall be. Treat it with care.
11625 : That leaves the bayld for you, Roskin.
11626 : Then so it shall be. Don't spend it all in one place.
11627 : That leaves the % for you, Roskin.
11628 : Your bags are full? No matter. Roskin can have the %.
11629 : That leaves you with the # bayld.
11630 : Hey, my favorite assistant! Remember those gifts that Margret gave us?
11631 : If you change your mind about which you want, just trade me the %.
11632 : If you change your mind about which you want, just trade me %.
11633 : Then I'll be willing to part with the % in exchange for # bayld.
11634 : Then I'll be willing to part with the # bayld.
11635 : It's the least I can do for so faithful an assistant.
11636 : You wanted the %--so here you go!
11637 : You wanted the # bayld--so here you go!
11638 : Wait--I asked for more bayld than this! Come back when you have the appropriate amount.
11639 : Well, well, look what I happened to stumble upon! I wonder who dropped this %?
11640 : Oh, if only I could find the rightful owner, and if only [he/she] would pay me # bayld for its return!
11641 : How do you react? Hand over the # bayld. It's not mine.
11642 : Why, this bayld is for me? Oh, what an unexpected and fortuitous turn of events! Fortuitous being the operative word here.
11643 : Now don't go around losing it again!
11644 : Y-y-you're sure!?
11645 : You hand over # bayld.
11646 : I can't very well give it to you when you've got stuff falling out of your bags already! I'll fork it over once you've made some room.
11647 : Wh-where on Vana'diel did you stumble across that hat?
11648 : What a terrible situation. I'd recognize that brim anywhere--that hat almost certainly belonged to Cedricaste.
11649 : He was a damn fine man, and a mentor to Margret in her younger years.
11650 : How does the saying go? A person like him only appears once a century? The coalition is lucky that we had two--Cedricaste and Margret.
11651 : Margret held him in the highest regard--we all did--and to think he met such an ignoble end in the hinterlands...
11652 : Perhaps you think this morbid, but...would you mind if I had that hat? I promise to treat it with the utmost care.
11653 : As talented as Margret is, she is young of age and should be looking toward the future, not beholden to the past.
11654 : When the time is right, I'll tell her the truth.
11655 : What do you do? Hand over the hat. Keep it for yourself.
11656 : I beg you to reconsider. This article means a lot to the coalition.
11657 : You have my sincerest thanks.
11658 : Cedricaste taught me that although the eyes may be deceived, the mind can always find the truth.
11659 : That's why all forms of information are valuable.
11660 : Margret doesn't need to know of our little arrangement.
11661 : Consider this not as hush money, but as payment for finding an invaluable artifact of the coalition.
11662 : A fine day to you, [sir/madam]. I trust you are here about a particular set of customers' tabs?
11663 : Thank you for your payment. We look forward to serving other members of the Mummers' Coalition.
11664 : Huh? Here to pick up someone's tab? Oh, the Mummers' Coalition. Right.
11665 : Might be a bit late, but it's better than nothing! Just tell those two to keep better tabs on it next time. Bwahaha!
11666 : The battle for peace and love is never ending--and I, Eternal Flame, Attache of Amour, dutifully stand at the front lines!
11667 : I come bearing a gift requested by dearest Fremilla. Could I trouble you to call for her?
11668 : Uh...Attache of Amourrr...?
11669 : Ah yes, the man from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Of course. One moment, please.
11670 : Ah, lovely Fremilla. I have brought it as you requested, together with a huge helping of love.
11671 : Oh, Eternal Flame! There is so much I--no, all of Adoulin--can learn from you!
11672 : Speak not a word more, for the Attache of Love...
11673 : Oh, heavens me! % is here too!
11674 : I think I get it! Eternal Flame, when you mentioned love, you must have meant...
11675 : ...That you have already secured %'s cooperation! My, my, you do think of everything!
11676 : N-no, it's nothing like that. Just we live in dark times without love, m'lady, and...
11677 : Thanks in advance, %!
11678 : How do you respond? Thanks for what? How is Arciela? How are you?
11679 : For what? Why, it's the, uh...what do you call it? Records of Eminence...?
11680 : Objective! That's the word! Our Eternal Flame friend surely filled you in.
11681 : He hasn't?
11682 : Eternal Flame, that's rather derelict of you!
11683 : No, what I was trying to say is... We live in an age where people yearn for peace, so...
11684 : Then it falls to the lovely Fremilla to set the wanderer back on [his/her] proper course.
11685 : You see, it all started when...
11686 : The princess?
11687 : Well, she hasn't been sitting on her keister in the throne room, that's for sure!
11688 : It's all Svenja this, pioneering that...a lesser woman would have doubtless turned to some horrible vice by now!
11689 : But back to the situation at hand. It all started when...
11690 : M-me?
11691 : Let's just say that I've gone through my third pair of shoes this month!
11692 : Of course, if we're talking about footwear, then the princess would do best to hire her own personal cobbler.
11693 : But back to the situation at hand. It all started when...
11694 : Ygnas...
11695 : Have you looked over the budget Chero-Machero proposed for repairing the damage caused in Rala Waterways?
11696 : ...
11697 : ...Ygnas?
11698 : Are you even listening!?
11699 : Our meeting starts any minute now, and you haven't even given it so much as a glance, have you?
11700 : Any minute indeed, Princess. You must get ready.
11701 : O-of course. I'll be along shortly.
11702 : Princess, is everything...
11703 : Every day I'm worried the two of them will break out in a kerfuffle!
11704 : But who can blame Ygnas for being stressed? Grenneth is always going on about how he would sneak out of the castle when he was a child...
11705 : ...So who's to say he isn't doing the same thing now? Who would expect a tottering leafkin to be the city's highest ruler?
11706 : But he has a sworn duty to guide his people! I don't care how much he wants to get a breath of fresh air!
11707 : Doesn't he give two whits about how Arciela is worked up into a tizzy?
11708 : But I know you do, %.
11709 : Eh-hem! And so the lovely Fremilla--always one to bring succor to those she loves--came up with a marvelous plan.
11710 : The first step is to ascertain exactly why he sneaks out.
11711 : That's where Eternal Flame comes in! I had him prepare a special Records of Eminence objective as incentive for someone to help me get to the bottom of this!
11712 : And of course I'm pleased as punch that it was you of all people who answered the call.
11713 : And now that you know what the deal is, chop-chop!
11714 : Stop by again if you learn anything!
11715 : ...B-but what about my love and peace?
11716 : A secrrret path out of the castle?
11717 : If I were a secret path, where would I be located? Probably a dusty alley or underground tunnel.
11718 : B-but a dutiful guard would not rrreveal such things so flippantly!
11719 : Don't worry, %. Cynthia already told me everything.
11720 : The Adoulin family always had a penchant for %, stretching back to August himself.
11721 : Sweet Altana above...
11722 : That wouldn't be odd by itself...but none of the tomatoes even made it to the kitchen!
11723 : I don't care how stressed he is. There's no way Ygnas could have scarfed them all down by himself. So then where...?
11724 : I haven't the foggiest!
11725 : Then we must follow the trail to solve this most perplexing of cases!
11726 : C'mon, %--they couldn't have gone far!
11727 : And by c'mon, I mean go on. I'm far too busy to join you.
11728 : And just like the last time--come back if you hear anything.
11729 : <Mutter> I swear, if I have to buy a fourth pair...
11730 : The mystery of the missing tomatoes? You won't learrrn anything unless you find Ygnas.
11731 : I'd scour every corrrner of this town for clues.
11732 : So, %, what've you learned?
11733 : Tarutaru Sauce Supreme...? What on Vana'diel is that?
11734 : Why, only the hottest comedic duo to hit Adoulin in the last fifty years!
11735 : Hmph! And how do you, of all people, know this?
11736 : I...went to see one of their shows.
11737 : And where did you find time to do that?
11738 : Never mind. I don't want to know. ...And he's performing with them?
11739 : ...I don't think I've been so befuddled in my whole life.
11740 : What could he possibly gain by being a two-bit hack of a performer?
11741 : He wants to spread the word of our good nation's tomatoes.
11742 : And I repeat--how do you, of all people, know this!?
11743 : J-just something I heard...
11744 : What exactly are you doing with that nonexistent free time of yours!?
11745 : %, is this true?
11746 : So let me get this straight. Ygnas has joined a troupe of bumbling wannabes in the hope of boosting sales of the Civic Arboretum's %?
11747 : Well...I suppose he has long been a champion of the arboretum's activities.
11748 : But it just doesn't make sense.
11749 : I should attempt to look on the bright side: at least he's working for the good of the city when he surreptitiously sneaks out in broad daylight.
11750 : Then Fremilla's judging gaze will have to be averted a little while longer.
11751 : %, I'm sure this isn't the last we've heard of this debacle. Your services will be required again sometime soon.
11752 : And Cynthia stands at the ready!
11753 : Uh...you've barely done anything.
11754 : Cynthia? Cynthia! Get back here!
11755 : You're wondering if Ygnas is still sneaking out?
11756 : Fremilla hasn't mentioned anything to me, but rrrest assured that you'll be the first to know.
11757 : Greetings, %. Let me call Frrremilla for you.
11758 : Hidy-ho, %! How can Fremilla be of service?
11759 : Eh-hem. It's happened again, %.
11760 : Huh? I'm talking about the princess, silly! Now hear me out!
11761 : Ygnas...
11762 : Did you check the minutes for the budget meeting on repairing the damage to the Rala Waterways?
11763 : ...!
11764 : Y-Ygnas?
11765 : Huh? F-Fusilton!?
11766 : Ygnas!!!
11767 : P-Princess, please forgive me.
11768 : I should be the one apologizing, Fusilton. It's not you I'm mad at.
11769 : I simply tried a candy that Master Ygnas offered me, and then...
11770 : How dare my brother drag you into this, Fusilton! He's got some nerve!
11771 : I was planning to ask his opinion on something before the meeting, but it's almost ready to start.
11772 : Princess, you must hurry. The meeting is about to begin.
11773 : Of course. I'm on my way.
11774 : Princess?
11775 : So you see, this crafty little ploy of his is how he's sneaking out of the castle!
11776 : Therefore! I must call upon you once again to investigate Lord Ygnas.
11777 : For the princess's sake, I want you to get to the bottom of this!
11778 : Now then, off you go! I'll be eagerly awaiting your report!
11779 : You are looking for Lorrrd Ygnas? That sounds like a job more suited to the Scouts' Coalition.
11780 : Ah, forrrgive me! It is not the place of a mere guard to speak of such things!
11781 : Ah, never have I seen anyone more cute.
11782 : Surely you think so, too?
11783 : Who do you look at? Yocile. Lola. Oston. Jampiaire.
11784 : Wh-what!? Are you crazy!?
11785 : In fact, I'd say she's thrice as nice as yesterday.
11786 : Hm? What's this now?
11787 : (I got it!)
11788 : I thought you might show up, %.
11789 : For some time now, I've been gathering info for the Scouts' Coalition, where I've become quite the superstar, if I do say so myself. Superstar being the operative word here.
11790 : And now, I've been charged with gathering information on a top secret project.
11791 : Have anything to say? Tell me more. Uh-huh. Fascinating.
11792 : Heh heh heh, I knew you'd be interested.
11793 : Say whatever you like, but in the end, you'll be glad I told you. I know you will.
11794 : Now, as I was saying...this is a top secret project.
11795 : Although, after all we've been through, we're as thick as thieves! I think I can share a few details with you!
11796 : Previously, you helped me gather information on the age of pioneers that served as the basis for the Great Expedition.
11797 : Of course, I'm the one who practically handed you the clues and shoved you out the door, but that's neither here nor there.
11798 : So, do you know about the game based on the Great Expedition?
11799 : Its name is...wait for it..."The Great Expedition"! It's a board game thought up by Margret back when she was a student.
11800 : The game was extremely popular among the other students at the time.
11801 : Margret frequently visited the Celennia Memorial Library in order to work on an expansion that closely followed history.
11802 : And so, what do you think happened as a result of that?
11803 : It followed history exactly. Nobody could defeat the threat that faced the forests of Ulbuka.
11804 : Gradually, the game's popularity began to wane, until eventually, people stopped playing it altogether.
11805 : And that's the long and short of it.
11806 : You might think it best to leave the past alone, but now the Scouts' Coalition is digging around for information necessary to develop a new game.
11807 : The theme for the game is living in harmony with the forest!
11808 : I think you can see where this is going... I've been tasked with serving as the head of the team responsible.
11809 : So I've gone from learning about the past to pioneering a greater future!
11810 : I agonized for days and nights until it finally hit me.
11811 : If you want to learn about the forest, then you should ask the forest itself. Brilliant, no?
11812 : So basically, I decided it'd be best to ask the leafkin, since they reside in the forest.
11813 : Of course, I'm going to have to look like a leafkin myself if I'm to have any hopes of talking to them.
11814 : I hear that if you eat %, you will look like a leafkin for a brief period of time. Brief being the operative word here.
11815 : In other words, what I'm trying to say is...
11816 : Go out there and find me some %!
11817 : Once you do, I'll be able to set the course of Adoulin's future!
11818 : More importantly, it'll give me a chance to get close to Yocile! That's just an added bonus, of course...
11819 : Go on now! Our future depends on you!
11820 : Grrr... Get close to Yocile!? W-we'll see about that!
11821 : I need you to bring me %.
11822 : I don't suppose the antiquary has any...
11823 : What's that? You need some %?
11824 : Forgive me, I'm just a poor little antiquary. I do not carry such items.
11825 : Wh-what's that? You want the scoop on leafkin candy?
11826 : Well, there's something called % that can be obtained at a festival in the Middle Lands.
11827 : Did you f-f-find that information useful?
11828 : Recently, I've been feeling someone staring at me from the shadows again. How creepy...
11829 : Ah, [young lady/young man], how's it going?
11830 : Well, good fer you, kid!
11831 : Yer in luck. That % yer lookin' for? It's one of my newest prrroducts!
11832 : Ya see, leafkin are quite popular 'round the bend these days.
11833 : In fact, people have regularly been making offers I can't refuse just to see Geosuke.
11834 : Can't let such an opporrrtunity go to waste, right?
11835 : Well, I should make a killin' at the next Vana'diel's Most Lovable Species contest.
11836 : Ya see, business is all about makin' contacts.
11837 : Speakin' of which, let's get down to brrrass tacks, shall we?
11838 : Hmm... About this % yer lookin' for... They're kinda hard to make in quantity, so the price is...let me see...
11839 : Ah, yes. The current prrrice is...I've got it right here...100,000 bayld! So, whaddya say?
11840 : What will it be? I'll take one. Are you crazy!?
11841 : Thanks for yer business! Please come again!
11842 : Hah hah! You drive a hard barrrgain! Okay, but just this once, ya hear?
11843 : Confound it all!
11844 : A flighty li'l swan came by here and was clearrrly up to somethin', but she said she'd buy 'em all!
11845 : That's too bad... This was a chance fer me to get my new prrroduct out on the market.
11846 : Wait! Yer a pioneer, arrren't ya?
11847 : If so, how 'bout ya bring me %?
11848 : If you do, I'll discount yer % to just 10,000 bayld. Whaddya say?
11849 : What will you do? Leave it to me! Leave it to me! Leave it to me! Leave it to me! Leave it to me! Leave it to me! Leave it to me! Leave it to me! Maybe some other time. Next.
11850 : Yer in luck! I'm runnin' a limited-time offer [/exclusively for Hume males/exclusively for Hume females/exclusively for Elvaan males/exclusively for Elvaan females/exclusively for Tarutaru males/exclusively for Tarutaru females/exclusively for Mithra/exclusively for Galka]! I know I's caught yer eye now!
11851 : Okay, it's a deal. Once ya get the %, brrring it to me.
11852 : There's no need to frrret. Bring the goods, and I won't have to have Geosuke here break yer kneecaps.
11853 : Thanks! Now, let's get this parrrty started!
11854 : Runje Desaali gives the % to Geosuke to drink.
11855 : Alrrright, Geosuke! I's leavin' the rrrest up to you!
11856 : Perrrfect! Absolutely perrrfect!
11857 : See? I told ya! Here's that % you were lookin' fer.
11858 : Hm? What's tha matter? Why do ya have that look on yer face?
11859 : Never mind. Let's see... We agrrreed on 10,000 bayld. So, do we have a deal?
11860 : Well, what will it be? (Bayld: #) Sure, I'll gladly pay # bayld. No thanks.
11861 : Hey, whatcha tryin' to pull herrre!? Yer a bit short, no?
11862 : Sorry, but I can't sell it to ya until ya got the money. Go take a few jobs frrrom the Couriers' Coalition or somethin'.
11863 : Hey, you don't have any space to carry this thing!
11864 : Sorry, but yer gonna need to empty that bag before I can sell this to ya.
11865 : Thanks for yer business! See, I always live up to my prrromises!
11866 : Come back wheneverrr ya need me to sell you some more. Ya can even see Geosuke while you'rrre at it!
11867 : Hey, this ain't no place to just be window-shopping!
11868 : Oh well. Come back wheneverrr ya need me to sell ya one.
11869 : You are now able to purchase % from Runje Desaali.
11870 : Ah, were you able to get some %?
11871 : D-don't think I'll just let you get your way!
11872 : ?? snatches the %!
11873 : Hah! Whaddya have to say now!?
11874 : Palomel!? Wh-why!?
11875 : This is no good. I'll never be able to carry out my charge now. Our once-promising future is in jeopardy!
11876 : Sorry about this, %, but I need you to get me another %.
11877 : You have to move quickly, though. My fated meeting with Yocile awaits!
11878 : This new prrroduct of mine is gonna be a huge hit!
11879 : That's why I need yourrr help, Geosuke! Don't let me down!
11880 : Okay! Let's give this thing a shot!
11881 : Always a pleasure, Master Sangy. I hope to see you again soon.
11882 : <Leafkin> Listen to this! <Leafkin> I think I've got an idea as <Leafkin> to what he's trying to say!
11883 : <Leafkin> I was going to try <Leafkin> and reply, but...
11884 : <Leafkin> I can't speak a word as <Leafkin> long as I'm like this!
11885 : <Leafkin> Huh? How do you know <Leafkin> what I'm saying!?
11886 : Trust me, it isn't hard to understand that simple mind of yours.
11887 : I think a-a-anybody could do it!
11888 : <Leafkin> Hey!
11889 : <Leafkin> Oh, that reminds me! <Leafkin> I'm forgetting something important!
11890 : <Leafkin> I'm on my way! <Leafkin> Wait for me, Miss Yocile!
11891 : Th-that's not gonna happen if I've got anything to say about it!
11892 : <Leafkin> Urgh!
11893 : Hmm... You neglect your work for this? That's minus twenty marks.
11894 : So, about this new game... Who do you think came up with the idea for it?
11895 : That's right. Lord Ygnas.
11896 : That was pretty wise of him to use this game to get the people of the city to live in harmony with the forest.
11897 : Do you recall that I once said that there are no witnesses to history?
11898 : That only physical evidence can serve to prove what happened before?
11899 : What if we applied this logic to the future?
11900 : That which has yet to happen can be either black or white, depending on the information at hand.
11901 : Fascinating, no?
11902 : It's enough to make me wonder if hiring him was a mistake.
11903 : I hope he dies a hundred times over!
11904 : What!? That leafkin was responsible for proposing the new board game!?
11905 : And to think I was trying to ask all those questions... How embarrassing!
11906 : Wh-what!? Lord Ygnas was talking to some young and beautiful waitress!?
11907 : Why would he even bother when Fremilla, one of the greatest beauties in the land, is right here!?
11908 : What's that? You think I should be focusing on the new board game?
11909 : I already know about "The Great Expedition."
11910 : W-wait! You've heard of it, too!?
11911 : It was in the storehouse, but there's a new version now?
11912 : Make up your mind, would you!? Do you know about it or not!?
11913 : <Sigh> How can I put this? It is a game that you play on a board...
11914 : ...and he's been making a similar one based on the theme of living in harmony with the forest...
11915 : ...so that the people in the city playing it can learn about the future of Adoulin?
11916 : That's the line he's spouting?
11917 : Hmm... I suppose a game does make it more approachable, and educational at that.
11918 : Although, I've got this gnawing feeling about that waitress...
11919 : %, it looks like I'm going to need to call upon your services once more!
11920 : Please let me know once you find out what's going on.
11921 : The waitrrress she's talking about must be Yocile.
11922 : I doubt there to be any impropriety between her and Lord Ygnas.
11923 : Ah, but you wouldn't be interested in my musings. Please, forrrget I mentioned anything.
11924 : Hm? You're looking for Master Sangy?
11925 : In that case, you should check with the Mummers' Coalition. I've seen him around there before.
11926 : What!? Master Ygnas was playing a game at the Mummers' Coalition!?
11927 : Now we've got him by the leaf...tail?
11928 : I've heard that the Mummers' Coalition is popular with young men courting their female acquaintances.
11929 : Clearly, he's simply using this game to scout out the location of his next tryst!
11930 : What? You're saying it's to help lift the spirits of the people in the city?
11931 : And as sales rise at the Mummers' Coalition, it will help generate the revenue needed to repair the Rala Waterways?
11932 : In that case, maybe his motives were a bit more pure.
11933 : Which means that it looks like Lady Fremilla's judgment will be staid once more.
11934 : Well, %! I'm sure I'll need to call upon you again sometime. Thanks in advance!
11935 : Crooked Die!
11936 : Cynthia, what is that you're going on about!?
11937 : Hey, Cynthia! Wait up!
11938 : A pleasurrre as always, %. If you're looking for Fremilla, she--
11939 : You won't be so lucky this time! I'll show you what crooked dice can do!
11940 : Ahem. Why, %, you're just the [man/woman] I was looking for. I assume you know what I need.
11941 : Ugh! You're impossible! I'm talking about Princess Arciela, you big oaf!
11942 : Ygnas...
11943 : I had a brief chat with Melvien's successor, who is adamant that we cannot allocate any more funds to the ongoing repairs in Rala Waterways without cutting something elsewhere.
11944 : ...?
11945 : Um, Ygnas? Are you listening?
11946 : Princess, you do realize that that's Geosuke, right?
11947 : Wh-what!?
11948 : Ygnas, why you--!
11949 : ...!
11950 : G-Geosuke, please forgive me. I'm not upset with you, it's just that my brother...
11951 : <Sigh>... How can we secure funds for Rala Waterways without Ygnas's approval?
11952 : P-Princess!!! I thought I saw Ygnas running around here, but...why are there two of them!?
11953 : Maybe I'm just imagining things, given how I've been working myself to the bone these past few weeks.
11954 : Um, Fremilla? One of them is Geosuke.
11955 : Geo-whosywhatsit?
11956 : <Sigh>
11957 : P-Princess?
11958 : Now do you get it? Ygnas flits out of the castle like a bird out of a nest without any care for what happens in his absence!
11959 : So this time, %, I expect results!
11960 : Get out there, track down Ygnas, and report back to me immediately!
11961 : Geosuke? He cerrrtainly is the popular figure in our city.
11962 : But let's leave the juicy gossip for a later date. I've got worrrk to do.
11963 : And so do you--there's a different leafkin you've got to worry about right now: Ygnas.
11964 : Ygnas was playing footsie with Midras in Yorcia Weald!?
11965 : Why on Vana'diel would he go all the way out there?
11966 : Wait--I get it! Last time we caught him playing Boom or Bust, so this time he wanted to go far, far away from the watchful gaze of the lovely Fremilla!
11967 : Oh-ho, but he has underestimated me! My web of informants spreads far and wide!
11968 : He wanted to remove the fetters that shackled Midras's spirits?
11969 : Well, if it helps the tomatoes taste better...
11970 : I guess you're right, Cynthia, and I suppose the pursuit of knowledge is a worthy goal...
11971 : ...but I still think we should keep a watchful eye on him.
11972 : And so, %, you know what you must do!
11973 : Go after the little troublemaker and figure out what his next plan is!
11974 : Lord Ygnas bounded out the frrront gate just a short while ago.
11975 : He's got to be around here somewhere...but where?
11976 : But I dare not concern myself with his affairs. I am but a simple guard.
11977 : Hey there, %! Against all odds, Nashu has graduated from his training and become a full-fledged exorcist!
11978 : It's a good thing too, because I wouldn't want to be in the way if he was turned down.
11979 : %! %! Over here!
11980 : How long has it been? Days? Months? Years? I lost track!
11981 : Really? That long? Well, all that matters to me is that you're healthy and happy.
11982 : Being an exorcist is hard work and...wait, why did I come here again?
11983 : Knowing you, probably to shirk your training.
11984 : Why, not in the slightest! I am scheduled to undergo some practical training before my upcoming pilgrimage!
11985 : At least you have a rational explanation this time. Best of luck.
11986 : And so, %, it's off to Yorcia Weald with me!
11987 : I know that we've got so much to catch up on, but I really must be off!
11988 : But I promise--we'll have a nice, long chat after I become High Exorcist!
11989 : See you around!
11990 : Nashu? He ran off west, in the direction of Yorcia Weald.
11991 : Studying in the order's sacred halls is important, but practical training plays a vital role as well.
11992 : Exorcists must always be looking to improve our skills if we are to keep Adoulin safe from outside threats!
11993 : Huh? I think you're going to have to start again from the beginning.
11994 : You and Ygnas traipsed around in the jungle and vanquished the Velkk king?
11995 : And the exorcists helped, too.
11996 : And the Blackthorn Coven. My, the two of you were quite busy.
11997 : Witches!? You worked with witches!?
11998 : Hang on--Cynthia, why do you know all this?
11999 : Because unlike you, I was paying attention.
12000 : To whom? % never said anything about witches!
12001 : To Ygnas.
12002 : Wait--let me get this straight.
12003 : Am I the only one in the entire castle who hasn't heard this story!?
12004 : I must be going crazy. Voices...I hear voices!
12005 : Don't worry about her. She gets like this sometimes.
12006 : I'll calm her down.
12007 : Have a good rest of your day, %.
12008 : %, may I have a moment of your time?
12009 : Lord Ygnas rrrequested that I give this to you.
12010 : With this insignia, the Order of Gorney will offer you some services not available to the ordinary public.
12011 : Looks a bit like a leafkin, doesn't it?
12012 : Here you go.
12013 : With how Fremilla's been in a tizzy the past few days, I wager it'll be a while before she calls on you again.
12014 : Ahem... I'm sorry for all of the trouble the other day.
12015 : Although, worry not, my friend! As you can see, Fremilla is back to her usual calm, cool, and collected self!
12016 : Now then, I'd like for us to review Ygnas's conduct once again before the wise and honorable Fremilla makes her verdict.
12017 : Let's go over what's transpired so far, shall we?
12018 : Hmm... First of all...
12019 : When Ygnas went to %, who was it he wanted to see?
12020 : Who did he go to see? Vicious Vorahal. Chalvava. Mukki. Sorry, I don't remember.
12021 : I'm disappointed in you, %... I guess I misjudged your abilities.
12022 : Please come back when you have the answers I seek.
12023 : %, I hope you're ready this time. Now, let's go over the details of my investigation once more.
12024 : Okay... Tell me, what was the reason for his visit?
12025 : What was the purpose of his visit? Watch the raptor fights. Construct a secret base. Collect %. Sorry, I don't remember.
12026 : So you're saying he went to watch the raptor fights with [Vorahal/Chalvava/Mukki]...
12027 : Vorahal... Umm, isn't he a raptor?
12028 : Mukki... That's actually a type of vegetable grown by Faomahd.
12029 : Chalvava... She's never been to see the raptor fights.
12030 : H-hey... I know that! Come on now, %. You need to take this more seriously!
12031 : In other words, he went to go construct a secret base with [Vorahal/Chalvava/Mukki]...
12032 : Chalvava... The only thing she makes is--vegetables.
12033 : So, he visited [Vorahal/Chalvava/Mukki] to collect some %.
12034 : Yes, Cynthia said the same thing--lucky guess, I'm sure. He apparently absconded with the % for some reason.
12035 : Although afterwards, they were never delivered to the castle's kitchen like they were supposed to be...
12036 : Then, upon chasing after him...
12037 : There was a comedy show being held in %. What was the name of that comedic duo again?
12038 : What was the name of the comedic duo? Tarutaru Sauce. The Dribbling Dopes. The Mighty Maidens. Sorry, I don't remember.
12039 : I see... And what were the % to be used for again?
12040 : What was their purpose? To be eaten. Props for the show. A gift for the audience. Sorry, I don't remember.
12041 : So, you're telling me he was going to eat them if he got hungry while watching the comedy show by [Tarutaru Sauce/the Dribbling Dopes/the Mighty Maidens]?
12042 : The Dribbling Dopes? They're a couple of dancers...
12043 : The Mighty Maidens? They're that popular girl duo...
12044 : Tarutaru Sauce... One of them's a notoriously big eater, but he didn't eat them...
12045 : You mean they were supposed to be used as props by [Tarutaru Sauce/The Dribbling Dopes/The Mighty Maidens] for their comedy show?
12046 : Tarutaru Sauce... They use a mannequin as a prop, but that's about it...
12047 : So, basically, they were to be given as a present to the fans attending the comedy show by [Tarutaru Sauce/The Dribbling Dopes/The Mighty Maidens].
12048 : In the end, it was all an attempt to increase the popularity of % with the people of Adoulin.
12049 : Now, let's go over the development of the new board game by the Scouts' Coalition. What was the theme of it again?
12050 : What was the theme? The Great Expedition. Living in harmony with the forest. The popularity of the leafkin. Sorry, I don't remember.
12051 : Okay... And what was the purpose of developing the board game?
12052 : Why was the game developed? To better % sales. To educate the townsfolk. To get close to a cafe employee... Sorry, I don't remember.
12053 : So this game based on [the Great Expedition/living in harmony with the forest/leafkin popularity] was made in an attempt to increase the sales of %...
12054 : The Great Expedition? That was the theme of their previous game.
12055 : Leafkin popularity? That was actually a business opportunity dreamed up by Geosuke and some others.
12056 : Living in harmony with the forest has nothing to do with boosting the sales of %.
12057 : So this game based on [The Great Expedition/living in harmony with the forest/leafkin popularity] was simply a ploy to get close to a waitress at the cafe...
12058 : Living in harmony with the forest... I'm not sure what that has to do with getting closer to a waitress.
12059 : So the thinking was that this game based on [The Great Expedition/living in harmony with the forest/leafkin popularity] would help educate the people of Adoulin...
12060 : Apparently, this whole thing came about due to a suggestion he made to the Scouts' Coalition.
12061 : Now, I'd like to talk about the man who was popular with those game fanatics throughout the Mummers' Coalition. What did they call him again?
12062 : What was he referred to as? The man in black. Golden Pioneer. Viridian Aristocrat. Sorry, I don't remember.
12063 : I see... And why was he playing the game again?
12064 : What was his reason for playing the game? To lift the people's spirits. To collect Mummers' Medals. To scout the location of his next date. Sorry, I don't remember.
12065 : You're claiming that he wanted to collect Mummers' Medals in order to be lovingly referred to as [the man in black/the Golden Pioneer/the Viridian Aristocrat] by the game's fans?
12066 : The man in black... That was actually Teodor...
12067 : The Golden Pioneer... I'm pretty sure that was what Levil called himself...
12068 : Collecting Mummers' Medals? That was Levil's reason for playing.
12069 : So he went there so often to scout a location for his next tryst that he became referred to as [the man in black/the Golden Pioneer/the Viridian Aristocrat]?
12070 : Scouting date locations? I don't think that was it...
12071 : So essentially, he tried so hard to cheer up the people that he came to be referred to among them as [the man in black/the Golden Pioneer/the Viridian Aristocrat]?
12072 : It resulted in increased sales at the Mummers' Coalition, which helped generate more revenue for repairing the Rala Waterways.
12073 : Moving along, let's talk about the time Ygnas went searching for somebody at the Inventors' Coalition. Who was he looking for again?
12074 : Who was he looking for? Amchuchu. Midras. Cid. Sorry, I don't remember.
12075 : I see... And why was it he was searching for them again?
12076 : Why was Ygnas searching for them? To remove what shackled their spirits. To learn the recipe for an explosive. To develop a new type of airship. Sorry, I don't remember.
12077 : You're trying to say that he went looking for [Amchuchu/Midras/Cid] to ask for a recipe on how to make explosives?
12078 : Amchuchu was already at the Inventors' Coalition. There was no need to look for her.
12079 : Cid... He was in Bastok, not at the Inventors' Coalition.
12080 : Midras... He's an expert with explosives, but I don't think that was Ygnas's reason.
12081 : Okay, he was looking for [Amchuchu/Midras/Cid] in order to develop a new type of airship...
12082 : Midras... It may be a dream of his to create a new airship, but I don't think that was Ygnas's reason.
12083 : So he was searching for [Amchuchu/Midras/Cid] in order to remove the fetters that shackled their heart...
12084 : And by removing those shackles, he thought it would help further the research into boosting the yield of the vegetable harvest.
12085 : Now then, tell me about the time the newly appointed exorcist Nashu was in trouble at %. What kind of trouble happened to him again?
12086 : What happened to him? Attacked by the Velkk. Attacked by umbrils. Attacked by the Blackthorn Coven. Sorry, I don't remember.
12087 : Yes... Tell me, %, who was it that saved you and Nashu?
12088 : Who saved you from harm? Grennith. Fusilton. Ygnas. Sorry, I don't remember.
12089 : So you worked together with [Grennith/Fusilton/Ygnas] to fend off the attack from the [Velkk/umbrils/Blackthorn Coven].
12090 : Grennith is pretty tough, but I don't think that's the right answer here.
12091 : Fusilton is a weakling. It definitely wasn't him.
12092 : The umbrils? They never attacked Nashu...
12093 : The Blackthorn Coven? They're friends of Nashu's.
12094 : The Velkk king's attempt at revenge ended in failure, and Nashu successfully passed his training exam with flying colors.
12095 : That concludes my investigation. Now it's time for the wise and honorable Fremilla to render her verdict!
12096 : Ygnas's actions are hereby found to be...
12097 : Completely justified!
12098 : Of course, that only goes for his actions covered by the scope of this investigation...
12099 : But this is not what Princess Arciela is expecting to hear! I feel so sorry for her!
12100 : %, don't you think so, too!?
12101 : However, there's no need to worry...
12102 : I had a feeling something like this might happen, so I've already prepared my next move!
12103 : I call it Operation: Give Sweets to Arciela to Make Her Feel Better!
12104 : Alright then, %... I need you to get % for me!
12105 : Alright then, %... I need you to get # % and # ) for me!
12106 : That will be sure to have the princess singing with glee!
12107 : Report back to Ploh Trishbahk when you're finished.
12108 : Okay, thanks again for your help on this!
12109 : You wish to confirm the sweets Fremilla rrrequested for Princess Arciela?
12110 : Hmm... It looks like you need to brrring %...
12111 : Hmm... It looks like you need to brrring # % and # %.
12112 : Once you have what I need, rrreturn here and I will summon Fremilla.
12113 : Ahh, these must be the rrrequested sweets for the princess.
12114 : Now then, please wait herrre a moment while I get Fremilla for you.
12115 : Yes, this will do just nicely...
12116 : I'm certain this will be just the thing to lift Princess Arciela's spirits.
12117 : Although, this whole situation has got me thinking...
12118 : As long as she continues to face the pressure of her official duties, this is only likely to be a temporary fix at best.
12119 : That's why I've been pondering various topics--everything that's happened so far, and what will happen in the future...
12120 : I found through my investigation into Ygnas that there is much about Adoulin I do not know.
12121 : And as long as I remain ignorant about such things, nothing will change. So, what should I do?
12122 : That's when I came up with the answer. In order to bring about positive change, I need to go out and conduct these investigations myself!
12123 : So, without further ado...
12124 : I've received word that Ygnas has been spotted in the %, so Fremilla the Great Detective is going to go check it out!
12125 : Okay, Cynthia! Let's get going!
12126 : Oh! I almost forgot!
12127 : Plohy, please give this to the princess for me! Thanks in advance!
12128 : Huh!?
12129 : [Fremilla/Cynthia] used the %.
12130 : Well, I can't say this is the grrreatest use of her time, but I suppose it is exactly the type of thing she'd do...
12131 : Oh yes, Fremilla said they werrre heading to the %.
12132 : I'm sure they'll be fine, but I rrreally can't help but worry about those two. Hopefully, nothing bad happens to them out there.
12133 : At any rrrate, I'll go and give these sweets you brought to Princess Arciela.
12134 : I deliverrred the sweets to Princess Arciela.
12135 : And it seems that Fremilla is continuing to trrry her hand at playing detective...
12136 : If you wish to know more about these mysterious devices, the Order of Orvail has investigated them quite thoroughly...
12137 : % showed the %.
12138 : Hm? Is this somehow related to the investigation?
12139 : Please forgive me. While I am well-versed in the ways of magic, I am quite clueless in regards to most other things.
12140 : What's that? The device responded to the item you showed me before?
12141 : I see... It seems these devices still possess many functions whose purpose continues to elude us.
12142 : I'm not sure if this is related to Sverdhried's efforts, but I shall report it to the lead investigator just in case.
12143 : Grrreetings, %.
12144 : Hm? You're here to see the princess?
12145 : Funny, that. She and Master Ygnas just returned a few minutes ago.
12146 : If you rrrequire an audience with her, you may proceed.
12147 : Hm? Is that you, %?
12148 : Hehe. You definitely are a strange one, aren't you.
12149 : Whenever I find myself in need of counsel, you appear as if out of nowhere.
12150 : You see, my brother and I just returned from a trip to speak with Sajj'aka.
12151 : The matter I'm seeking counsel on is related to what he told us.
12152 : What do you mean, Your Eminence!?
12153 : There is nothing else for me to sssay beyond that which I have already told you.
12154 : Though I know not the reason, I can no longer sssense the presence of the Ulbukan jungle's guardian.
12155 : Naturally, I am not referring to the Naakuals.
12156 : Traditionally, their role has been to watch the path to the Serpentine Labyrinth. As you know, we have already ssspoken in detail about them.
12157 : No, the entity I can no longer sssense is the one true guardian of the Ulbukan jungle...
12158 : Could you be referring to the prime avatar Siren, the one with command over all of nature?
12159 : You sssurmise correctly, mortal. All signs of Siren's presence from within the Ulbukan jungle have vanished without a trace.
12160 : But, how could such a thing happen?
12161 : Indeed... Even I know not the answer to your question.
12162 : Yet, there is one thing I can sssay with certainty.
12163 : Unless you enlist Siren's assistance, it will be a difficult tasssk to accomplish your goal of living in harmony with the forest.
12164 : Surely you understand that by itssself, humanity's fleeting existence is much too short for such a task.
12165 : If that is true, then what other path can we take...
12166 : Please, you must help us, Your Eminence. Where did Siren go?
12167 : Forgive me. Though I have sssurvived the ravages of time, doing so does not imbue me with the power of omniscience...
12168 : I have thought about speaking with Lhaiso and Ikhi in regards to the matter.
12169 : I figure that as geomancers, perhaps they might know something.
12170 : Although, if I'm not careful about what I say, it'll just lead to much needless worry...
12171 : So, %... Talking with you has made things clear to me.
12172 : Hm?
12173 : You say that Siren disappeared in %?
12174 : And that she did so on her own volition!?
12175 : I see... It seems hard to believe, but I have never known you to lie.
12176 : Please, %...
12177 : Would you mind journeying to % and seeing if anybody there has any information regarding Siren?
12178 : I suppose that's all we can do for the moment.
12179 : Once again, you are my only hope.
12180 : So I hear you'rrre going to %.
12181 : Be careful out there, okay?
12182 : Hm? %? Where's that?
12183 : Welcome back. Lady Arciela is anxiously awaiting your rrreturn.
12184 : It's good to see you've returned safely, %.
12185 : So, how did it go?
12186 : You show Arciela the %.
12187 : You found that in the location where Siren disappeared?
12188 : Hmm... Maybe we should show this bell to Sajj'aka.
12189 : Yes, you may be right, Ygnas.
12190 : Now then, let us return to Sajj'aka!
12191 : %, will you please accompany us?
12192 : Lady Arciela has set out for %.
12193 : I hear you are headed there as well. I wish you a safe and pleasant journey.

12207 : What say you to looking over our selection of Pioneers' Coalition tools?
12208 : Care to purrruse our selection of Pioneers' Coalition equipment?
12209 : Need help making your Mog Garden the greatest around? Then I'm the one to ask!
12210 : I don't know which is more astounding--the superb lessons in gathering techniques we offer to pioneers or the contributions you can make to the colonization movement after you've finished them!
12211 : Want some equipment to help you protect the town like a true Peacekeepers' Coalition member?
12212 : I don't mind parting with some of this Peacekeepers' Coalition equipment as long as it's for a good cause.
12213 : Adornments, accoutermentarus, and appurtenances from the Peacekeepers' Coalition here!
12214 : Be the firrrst to establish your territory by nabbing some Peacekeepers' Coalition-exclusive wares!
12215 : I have been granted permission to issue you a panoply of Couriers' Coalition warp runes.
12216 : I've got some Couriers' Coalition goods here. Take 'em or leave 'em.
12217 : Mind if I enchantaru you with some Couriers' Coalition hocus-wocus?
12218 : Want to hear some special-wecial tidbitarus about where the Couriers' Coalition can deliver to now?
12219 : What would we be if we couldn't prrrovide accurate maps? Dead, that's what!
12220 : Want to use the Scouts' Coalition's marking serrrvice?
12221 : Extra, extra, read all about it! The latest-watest Scouts' Coalition intelligence reports are in!
12222 : Do you wish to know how the ergon locus surveys throughoutaru Eastern Ulbuka are progressing?
12223 : Always be prepared. That's one of the Scouts' Coalition's many mottos, especially when it comes to spoils! I can tell you exactly how sweet victory will taste!
12224 : Care to peek through some of the Celennia Memorial Library's tomes? It always pays to be well-informed.
12225 : Ugtoor of the Inventors' Coalition, at your service. I provide...goods of the guild, so to speak.
12226 : Got bayld? Then I'd be happy to hand over some of the finest Inventors' Coalition creations you'll ever see!
12227 : I am more than willing to supply you with a diverse selection of Inventors' Coalition sundries, but only if you possess an adequate amount of bayld.
12228 : You too can have some of the Inventors' Coalition's highly coveted ergon tinctures in exchange for a tiny pinch of bayld!
12229 : You already know of the ergon loci--locations from which inexplicable powers emanate--don't you?
12230 : While we may have yet to fully understand them, we have succeeded in bottling their essence! As a nod to this elixir's source, we call it ergon tincture.
12231 : Visitaru me any time you'd like to use my arcane glyptic power-wowers to augment your Traditional Armor...if you've got some coalition grease laying around.
12232 : What're arcane glyptics? They closely resemble what you Middle Landers call augments, but there are some slight differences.
12233 : Bayld or obsidian fragments for special arcane glyptics here, plain and simple-wimple. What isn't so simple, though, is that I'm only interestaru'd in weaponry from worlds beyond our own. Also, I'm particular-wicularly fond of ghastly stones.
12234 : Do you wish to have the equipment you wrested from the clutches of the continent's menaces bestowed with certain arcane glyptics? If not, your soul will forever be consumed with regret.
12235 : Take what you want and get out of my face...but not before paying with some obsidian fragments.
12236 : Obsidian fragments are rare things. You can only get them by pioneering.
12237 : Their most obvious use is for redeeming things, but we're trying to research new uses for them. Now hurry up and get your shopping done.
12238 : <Sigh> We've been ordered to accept your old % in exchange for %.
12239 : I have to give you # ) for every # %.
12240 : A very simple process. As I like to say, Wham, bam, and now scram.
12241 : We've also started some nonsense about trading stones for obsidian fragments.
12242 : I would say I'm pleased to tell you the exchange rate for [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/mummers' medals], but I'm really not.
12243 : Obsidian fragment exchange rate: # fragment[/s] for # %. # fragment[/s] for # %. # fragment[/s] for # %.
12244 : Just trade me the stones you want to exchange when you feel like it. Don't expect any niceties from me, though.
12245 : You want to trade in %? Get on with it, then.
12246 : Trade # )? No thanks. Trade for # [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/mummers' medals]. Exchange for # %.
12247 : Proceed with the exchange? Yes, please. I need some time to think.
12248 : You cannot carry any more [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/mummers' medals].
12249 : You receive # obsidian fragments, and now possess a total of # out of a possible #.
12250 : I'm currently obligated to tell you that we are now able to take your old stones used in skirmishes and give you new ones.
12251 : From what I remember, the rate is something like # ) for every # ) and...
12252 : ...# ) for every # %.

12293 : What is it you need to know? Nothing, for I know all. The latest spoils intelligence. What exactly is this service?
12294 : We conduct censuses from time to time on what spoils Adoulin's pioneers have procured from their victories, and then make that information public via lottery.
12295 : Now, when I talk about spoils, I mean strictly ones obtained in battle. Not goods that you can't show off to your loved ones back home.
12296 : I'd also like to clarify that what individuals receive and what gets split amongst party members are all presented in the same report. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it is what it is.

12351 : It appears that you can enter a two-digit combination between # and #.
12352 : If you enjoy tossing dice every so often, this may just be the challenge you have been searching for. Who shall reach 11 with a few flicks of the wrist first--you or me?
12353 : Either you or I may choose to shoot and roll the dice, stay and do nothing, or pick from three tricks up your sleeve.
12354 : The three tricks in your arsenal of deception include Sneak Peek, which allows you to see your opponent's shots, using the old Switcheroo and trading shots with your opponent, or forcing your opponent to reroll a shot of his choice with Crooked Die.
12355 : These three tricks will spin the wheel of fortune in your favor, but it is precisely because of their immense powers that we must limit their use to once per game.
12356 : Make sure you attempt to turn the tables at the right time, or Lady Luck will be the one cleaning house.
12357 : You shot a #, for a total of # on turn number #.
12359 : It is now turn number # for [you/your opponent].
12360 : [You/Your opponent] [shot/stayed].
12361 : What will you do? Shoot. Stay. Use a trick up my sleeve. Fold.
12362 : Which trick will you use? None, I've changed my mind. Sneak Peek. Switcheroo. Crooked Die.
12363 : Look at which shot? ([Sneak Peek/Switcheroo/Reroll]) None, I've changed my mind. Shot one. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot two. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot three. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot four.

[???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot eleven. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6]
12364 : You snuck a peek at one of your opponent's dice! Shot number # was a # for him.
12365 : You used the old switcheroo! Your # has been exchanged with your opponent's #, and your total is now #.
12366 : You forced your opponent to shoot again! His shot for turn number # is now #.
12367 : Choose [your opponent's/your] die and [peek at it/exchange it/make him shoot again].
12368 : Your opponent's total: #[/ (Bust!)] Your total: #[/ (Bust!)] [You win, and thus have the right to gloat all you want until your rematch./Don't go throwing your dice just because you lost, all right?/You are equally matched, and have drawn.]
12369 : Clear your mind and ready your chronological senses, for this amusement pits you against time's dilatory creep. The objective here's to speak to me a certain amount of times at the intervals I tell you.
12370 : Just so you know, I'll only give you the length of time to wait and how far off you were from the specified interval when spoken to. Furthermore, the difference between your guess and the answer is cumulative.
12371 : If you're too slow one round, you can make up time by being a little fast the next.
12372 : Finally, you claim victory by staying within a certain number of seconds by the end of the final round. I hope this cleared things up, and enjoy honing your mastery over Father Time.
12373 : I take it that means you're in the correct state of mind to challenge the forces of time. Let's do this!
12374 : Countdown initiated! Your target time for round number # is # seconds.
12375 : You were off by...# second[/s]. Your target interval for round number # is # second[/s].
12376 : It's judgment time! You were [a total of /a total of /]# second[/s] [early./late./off. In other words, perfectly on-target!] [It seems that the concept of time eludes you./Congratulations, you've temporarily mastered the forces of time!]
12377 : A wet and wild adventure, this. You and I take turns filling a goblet with water until the cup runneth over, with the offending competitor sent to drown in shame.
12378 : The rub is that it looks as if there is more water in the goblet than actually exists. Thus you will need to exercise the entirety of your patience and perspicacity to wrench victory from my clutches.
12379 : As if that were not enough, I have added an extra layer of frustration by granting us competitors certain abilities dubbed afflictions and remedies.
12380 : On the one hand, afflictions allow you to do such things as change the amount of water I see.
12381 : You can also use them to negate the effects of my remedies or limit the amount of water I can pour.
12382 : On the other hand, remedies help increase or decrease either the amount of the water you can pour or the amount of water in the goblet. As a final twist, they can also negate the effects of afflictions.
12383 : Afflictions and remedies cause the tides of competition to surge and swell to an extreme degree, so we restrict their use to once per game. Be prudent with which you use and when.
12384 : What will you do? Pour away! Use an affliction. Use a remedy. Throw in the towel.
12385 : How will you afflict your opponent? I won't, that's how. Increase amount poured. Decrease amount poured. Fabricate water level. Remove a remedy. Restrict to greater pouring options. Restrict to lesser pouring options.
12386 : What remedy will you use? None, that's what! Increase amount poured. Decrease amount poured. Cure an affliction. Increase maximum water level. Decrease maximum water level.
12387 : Pour how much? (Currently # onz[/es].) One onz. Two onzes. Three onzes. Four onzes. Five onzes.
12388 : [You used an affliction on Etienne./You used a remedy on yourself./You cured an affliction.]
12389 : [You/Etienne] poured water into the goblet. There [is/are] currently # onz[/es] of water in it.
12390 : [You/Etienne] poured water into the goblet, causing it to overflow. [You have bested your challenger. Claim what is yours by lapping the tears of defeat from his face and tasting the glorious sorrow contained within./How does complete and utter defeat feel? Will you even be able to sleep once night falls?]
12391 : Should you seek salvation by enhancing your equipment through arcane glyptics, simply bequeath the requisite materials and equipment to me and I shall work my magic.
12392 : No ordinary beings can perform the feats I accomplish even before breakfast, so there will of course be a slight charge for my services...# bayld, to be exact.
12393 : Even pioneers like you seeking refuge in amusements can't escape the time's inevitable ticking. The last time you played this game, you were disqualified for exceeding the time limit.

12411 : %.
12412 : What shall you do? (Bayld: #) Not a thing. Mezzotint equipment. Check materials required. Inquire about arcane glyptics.
12413 : Arcane glyptics are truly astounding engravings--they can be used to enhance a cornucopia of equipment you find during your pioneering journeys! However, they cannot work their magic until the article in question undergoes a priming process called mezzotinting.
12414 : There are three glyptic paths down which you may send your equipment. All of them differ in significant ways and will not fail to treat your beloved accouterments right.
12415 : Moreover, your inanimate comrades in combat can be further enhanced by employing materials such as % during glyptic engraving.
12416 : I must warn you, however, that the process is not instantaneous. We will need to engrave your articles multiple times before any glyptics take effect.
12417 : Think of it like your pioneering activities. Ulbuka cannot be colonized in a day, nor can we improve your equipment in one try if we want to do a satisfactory job. In addition, your equipment may undergo mezzotinting any time you wish to set it down a new path to clearing the continent of danger. Simply ask and you shall receive.
12418 : Lest I forget, I should also mention that a fee of # bayld is required for the first mezzotinting, while # is the price for subsequent ones and enhancement via materials.
12419 : Your % has already been engraved with an arcane glyptic, the benefits of which will be lost upon mezzotinting. Do you still wish to proceed?
12420 : Proceed with mezzotinting? Yes, scrape all the excess benefits away! No, I love my little precious too much!
12421 : Which type of glyptics shall you engrave?
12422 : Which type do you want engraved? None. Arcane Glyptic Type A. Arcane Glyptic Type B. Arcane Glyptic Type C.
12423 : Do you wish to mezzotint your weapon so that it is primed to receive the aforementioned attribute enhancements?

12428 : This % looks as if it can be engraved with a peculiar sort of arcane glyptic. It may behoove you to show this to the person in charge of such procedures.
12429 : Take a gander at what? Nothing. Equipment. Materials.
12430 : Arcane glyptics can only do so much, and it seems your % has reached that limit.
12431 : I do not believe your % has undergone the mezzotinting process as of yet. If that is the case, I am only able to accept that piece of equipment for now, and hereby return the other item to you.

12439 : For a tiny bit of bayld or a smidgen of obsidian fragments, I can transmutaru your equipment or engrave it with arcane glyptic-wyptics.
12440 : What will you do? ([Bayld/Obs. Frag./Mweya Plasm]: #) Nothing. [Proceed with the exchange/Learn about augmentation/Proceed with the exchange/Proceed with the exchange].

12441 : If you ever-wever want to transmute equipment, just trade me the appropriataru piece and nothing more while in possession of %.
12442 : Now, I'm an honestaru businessman. I'll tell you in advance that I require a fee of # bayld for my service.
12443 : Transmutation is a process resembling-wembling the synthesis of high-quality equipment.
12444 : The process is shrouded-wouded in mystery, and we aren't about to give away our secrets. I will, however, impartaru to you that we employ % to work our magic.
12445 : As a note of warning, transmuting equipment rubs out any arcane glyptics you have currentaruly engraved. Sorry, but dem's da breaks.
12446 : The following must be procured to engrave arcane glyptics on %.
12447 : The following must be procured to transmute %.
12448 : %.
12449 : I will need-weed # bayld to transmute this %.
12450 : Begin your journey down the wonderful road of transmutation-wation!
12451 : What shall you do? Check current attributes. Check post-transmutation attributes. Transmute the equipment. Nothing.
12452 : Transmute the piece of equipment? Yes. No.
12453 : End transmutation? Yes. No.
12454 : Just so you know, I don't transmutaru anything for people who aren't in possession of either % or %.
12455 : If you do have one, though, you need only trade-wade me the equipmentaru in question.
12456 : The whole process-wocess is easier than making trail cookies! We take % or % and...
12457 : ...Use our magical inventors' powers to transmute the articles you give us! What, you thoughtaru we'd just give away our closely guarded secret to possible competition?
12458 : Your % now has # reinforcement point[/s].
12459 : I know your type. You're one of those pioneer-wioneers who likes to try [his/her] luck. Well, then, there is no more appropriataru game for you in all of Adoulin than the oft-lauded Box...of...Fortune!
12460 : What makes this game so greataru is that it requires not a lick of skill whatsoever.
12461 : An egalitarian-warian roll of the dice determines which of the # treasure chests you'll open. Depending on the trove inside, you'll get somewhere between a handful and a mountain of mummers' medals.
12462 : The three types of ticketarus to wealth that dwell inside chests are: crystals such as %, spirits like %, and jewels the likes of %.
12463 : Crystals are the condensed-wensed form of # medal[/s], spirits scare # medal[/s] into your clutches, and jewels glintaru with the power of # medal[/s].
12464 : What's more, unboxing a jewel immediataruly puts you on a hot streak more scorching-worching than the fires of Moh Gates.
12465 : Once you're on a hot streak, you have a high chance of revealing more jewels, but all good things must come to an end. Should either a crystal or spirit pop out from a chestaru, your flames get doused.
12466 : Now, you're free to stop playing anytime you wish, but I wouldn't recommend doing it while you're on a hot streak. It would mean snuffing-wuffing out your streak faster than a chapuli's horn can slice through your legs.
12467 : No funny stuff here, just a plain-wain roll of the dice.
12468 : The chest opens to reveal %! You win # mummers' medal[/s]!
12469 : Welcome to the wonderful arena that is Three-Card Circus. I, Olivaine, will be your ringmistress.
12470 : To win this greatest amusement on Vana'diel, you must collect suit and number combinations of the three cards you are dealt. Each card will be imprinted with one of four suits and six numbers.
12471 : It is possible to trade in a maximum of three times, and the amount of cards you draw is equal to the number you discard. Of course, it is acceptable to step down from exchanging should you feel you are walking on a tightrope.
12472 : As for the combinations, each one is worth a different number of points. In the event that all three of your cards display different numbers, only the largest one shall count toward your point total.
12473 : If you possess a pair, you gain a number of points equal to twice the number of your remaining card.
12474 : Furthermore, should you have three of a kind, you will receive fifty points regardless of the cards' number.
12475 : Additionally, having cards of all the same suit gives you points equal to twice the total of the numbers on the cards in your hand.
12476 : Lastly, should the numbers on your cards total eleven, you will receive three times the amount of points.
12477 : [Your/Olivaine's] hand consists of: A [//]#, a [//]#, and a [//]#.
12478 : What will you do? View your hand. Trade in. View discard pile. Listen to an explanation. Stop trading.
12479 : The following cards have been discarded. Go back. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#.
12480 : This card has already been dealt.
12481 : Trade in which one? None. [//]#. ([Hold/Trade]) [//]#. ([Hold/Trade]) [//]#. ([Hold/Trade]) Confirm trade.
12482 : [You have/Olivaine has] chosen not to trade in.
12483 : [You/Olivaine] discard[/s] a [//]# and draw[/s] # card[/s]!
12484 : [You/Olivaine] discard[/s] a [//]# and a [//]#, then draw[/s] # card[/s]!
12485 : [You/Olivaine] discard[/s] a [//]#, a [//]#, and a [//]#, then draw[/s] # card[/s]!
12486 : It is time for us to reveal our hands. <Drum Roll>
12487 : You have # point[/s], while Olivaine has # point[/s]. [You win, making you the leading act!/Olivaine has thoroughly tamed you with her victory./It's a tie! Time to jump through another ring of fire.]
12488 : I'm also now offering obsidian fragmentarus for another type of stone with a weird name.
12489 : There's a veritable cornucopia-wopia of arcane glyptics I can engrave upon your %, but their effects tend to differ depending on the materials used.
12490 : Got # obsidian fragment[/s] on your hands? Then I can engrave your % with some astounding arcane glyptic-wyptics!
12491 : Ah, but certain pieces of equipmentaru will require a little more tender loving care...along with # obsidian fragment[/s] to compensate.
12492 : Have you ever feltaru that those special stones from skirmishes you've been lugging around in your bags have been cramping your style? Well, you're in luck! I've started-warted a storage service to meet the needs of the times.
12493 : So you want me to hold some % for you? Let me have a look... This makes for a total of # I have stored for you.
12494 : Unfortunataruly, my boxes are already crammed full, and I can't store any more % for you.
12495 : I'll happily store skirmish stones for you. Just trade-wade them to me one type at a time.
12496 : I'm able to save up the following material-werials.
12497 : You've currently entrustarued me with the following items.
12498 : Have which item returned? None of the above. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Previous page. Next page.
12499 : My records indicataru that I'm holding # of that type for you. How many would you like?
12500 : #? I'll get them for you right away.
12501 : Not interested-winterested? Never fear, I'll still be here should you require me to return them.
12502 : Don't try to pull a fastaru one on me! I'm not holding that many % for you! Only #!
12503 : With the way your bags are bulging-wulging, there's no way you could fit anything else in there! Come back once you've made some room.
12504 : Up for bashing some skulls? Well, you're in luck, because I can engrave your % with bonuses to strength, dexterity, accuracy, and critical hit damage.
12505 : Fists of Fury not quite furious enough? Then take a look at what bonuses I can engrave on your %: strength, dexterity, Counter, and Subtle Blow.
12506 : Topping up your comrades more your style? Then you'll probably want your % engraved with bonuses to magic accuracy, healing magic skill, enhancing magic skill, and Cure potency.
12507 : If you're into blasting your enemies with magic, then you'll probably want me to engrave your % with enhancements to Magic Attack Bonus, Fast Cast, elemental magic skill, and dark magic skill.
12508 : The discerning red mage will surely prefer their % engraved with bonuses to magic accuracy, enfeebling magic skill, enhancing magic skill, and enhancing magic duration.
12509 : The more unscrupulous gil-nabbers will appreciate % engraved with dexterity, agility, Dual Wield, and critical hit damage.
12510 : If your calling is to protect your allies, you'll want your % engraved with bonuses to dexterity, vitality, enmity, and Phalanx.
12511 : The darkest among the dark will certainly desire % engraved with bonuses to attack, dark magic skill, weapon skill damage, and Drain and Aspir potency.
12512 : Help your favorite companion become better than ever before with % engraved with enhancements to strength, dexterity, accuracy, pet damage resistance, and pet accuracy.
12513 : Be safer than ever when supporting your allies with % engraved with HP, magic accuracy, decreased enmity, and decreased damage taken.

12517 : Leap to even greater heights when your % is engraved with enhancements to strength, weapon skill damage, wyvern damage resistance, and wyvern breath potency.
12518 : Need a stronger avatar? Then you'll surely appreciate % engraved with bonuses to summoning magic skill and Blood Pact damage, decreased Blood Pact recast time II, and increased avatar enmity.

12526 : How many would you like?
12527 : How many? (# [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/Mummers' medals]) Exchange. (# [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/Mummers' medals] needed) Let me think some more.
12528 : Excuse me, but I do not believe you have %, do you?
12529 : Oh, that's too bad, because we would love for you to help us with the colonization effort. If you are willing, then by all means, speak with Brenton so he can outfit you with one.
12530 : My name is  and it is my duty to make sure all pioneers are properly prepared to face the many terrifying dangers that wait in the wilds. May I inquire as to your needs?
12531 : What do you need? Would you cast Ionis on me? Can you tell me Ionis's effects? What exactly is Ionis? Absolutely nothing.
12532 : It pains me to report that I cannot cast Ionis upon you because none of the coalitions are advanced enough to impart any powers upon it.
12533 : In order to bestow Ionis upon you, I will need to exact a fee of # bayld.
12534 : You know what they say--all things have their price. What say you?
12535 : Truly have Ionis cast? (Bayld: #) Cast away! Not so fast.
12536 : Thank you for your #-bayld donation to the city. And now, let us proceed with the casting!
12537 : Um...how embarrassing... How should I say this...? You do not seem to possess ample bayld.
12538 : To each [his/her] own, I suppose. Is there anything else you require?
12539 : The power Ionis bestows fluctuates depending on how advanced each coalition is.
12540 : Select a coalition. None. Pioneers'. Peacekeepers'. Couriers'. Scouts'. Inventors'. Mummers'.
12541 : Here is how the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition contributes to Ionis.
12542 : Whoops, it seems they do not add any additional effects.
12543 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Attack Enhancement/Minor Magic Attack Bonus/Minor Gathering Fatigue Reduction/Minor Gathering Efficacy Enhancement/Moderate Attack Enhancement/Moderate Magic Attack Bonus/Moderate Gathering Fatigue Reduction/Moderate Gathering Efficacy Enhancement] will be bestowed upon you.
12544 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Defense Enhancement/Minor Magic Defense Bonus/Minor HP and MP Recovery Enhancement/Minor Enhancement to Max HP and MP/Moderate Defense Enhancement/Moderate Magic Defense Bonus/Moderate HP and MP Recovery Enhancement/Moderate Enhancement to Max HP and MP] will be bestowed upon you.
12545 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Accuracy and Magic Accuracy Enhancement/Minor Evasion and Magic Evasion Enhancement/Minor Critical Hit Rate Increase/Minor Haste Effect/Moderate Accuracy and Magic Accuracy Enhancement/Moderate Evasion and Magic Evasion Enhancement/Moderate Critical Hit Rate Increase/Moderate Haste Effect] will be bestowed upon you.
12546 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Save TP Effect/Minor Conserve MP Effect/Minor Fast Cast Effect/Minor Resistance Increase to All Status Ailments/Moderate Save TP Effect/Moderate Conserve MP Effect/Moderate Fast Cast Effect/Moderate Resistance Increase to All Status Ailments] will be bestowed upon you.
12547 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Crystal Obtainment Rate Increase/Minor Material Loss Rate Reduction/Minor Synthesis Skill Gain Rate Increase/Minor Synthesis Success Rate Increase/Moderate Crystal Obtainment Rate Increase/Moderate Material Loss Rate Reduction/Moderate Synthesis Skill Gain Rate Increase/Moderate Synthesis Success Rate Increase] will be bestowed upon you.
12548 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Combat Skill Gain Rate Increase/Minor Magic Skill Gain Rate Increase/Minor Experience Point Bonus/Minor Reward Obtainment Rate Increase/Moderate Combat Skill Gain Rate Increase/Moderate Magic Skill Gain Rate Increase/Moderate Experience Point Bonus/Moderate Reward Obtainment Rate Increase] will be bestowed upon you.
12549 : What a tricky question. Well...it is a thaumaturgical aura that grants multitudes of benefits to pioneers.
12550 : What is truly interesting is that this aura draws its powers from the various coalitions. The larger they grow, the more powerful the benefits each one will provide.
12551 : The more pioneering feats you perform, the more the coalitions develop, and the more beneficial Ionis becomes. Think of it as a virtuous cycle!
12552 : You have been imbued with the power of Ionis!
12553 : Hello there, adventurer. My name is Octavien and I hail from the Order of Orvail.
12554 : So, my adventuring friend, how long did it take for you to reach Adoulin?
12555 : Heh heh heh, I assure you my powers of perspicacity are not the same as omniscience. 'Tis but a trifle to tell outsiders from those of Adoulinian stock. One's gait, [his/her] posture...or even the powers that lay dormant within [him/her] provide ample evidence as to [his/her] identity.
12556 : Perhaps I am right about something else as well. Do you happen to know of runes--magical emblems that have been passed down for generations?
12557 : Know you of runes? Of course. Sadly, I do not.
12558 : Aha, I knew it! What an enlightened individual I've come across. Still, possessing a mere passing knowledge of runes is insufficient to fully comprehend the mysteries contained within. Let me provide you with a more thorough explanation.
12559 : Runes have existed since the age of the gods and are considered sacred, or so certain legends portend.
12560 : Still more legends assert that the symbols first emerged from the north, on the continent of Rhazowa.
12561 : However, all accounts seem to agree that each letter in this mystical array harbors powers of thaumaturgic significance. Moreover, this special magic can only be released by a few talented individuals.
12562 : Those able to unlock the true nature of these uncharacteristically powerful characters are dubbed rune fencers.
12563 : Now as to why I asked my prior question and possibly bored you with a story as old as time immemorial:
12564 : I have reason to believe you are one of the chosen, one of those who can unlock the true potential of these runes. Call it runesmith's intuition.
12565 : That should be sufficient background information. After all, my true purpose isn't to flaunt my vast intellect, but to awaken the latent rune powers of the chosen, per the order of the Order of Orvail.
12566 : But I digress. Should you truly wish to walk the path of the rune fencer, I would be more than happy to guide you.
12567 : The road is long, strenuous, and--above all else--steep. Many runesmith cragsmen have lost their foothold during their climb only to plummet to the darkest depths of concession, their days spent shrouded in shame.
12568 : Proclivities and propensities, aversions and antitheses...these are the cards you are constantly dealt to deal with your opposition!
12569 : Yet the first step starts with runic theory, then a hop to sparring, skipping to field practice, and finally a jump to applying your years of experience. The regimen is so harsh that many students often step down in dismay after the first few years.
12570 : What do you think? The...first few years...? Slay me now.
12571 : Maybe I should be more forthright in my explanation. That's the straight and narrow way of learning the craft. There is a shortcut now, its only shortcomings being the risks that accompany it.
12572 : Certain practitioners have, in these recent years, begun engraving runes into their flesh.
12573 : Those who favor this route are often routed in battle...be they not accompanied by an absorbent mind, quick reflexes, and an adaptive body.
12574 : Should you fail to keep those traits carved upon your soul, you shall forever lose the ability to manipulate runes...
12575 : Knowing this, do you still wish to proceed and inscribe symbols upon your skin that could very well spell your own death?
12576 : Inscribe the runes? Yes, I'm ready. No, my life is too precious!
12577 : I suppose my intuition was wrong after all. Very well...but do not hesitate to return should you have a change of heart.
12578 : So, you return. Have you decided to tiptoe along the path of runic arts and to always be prepared for a perilous fall from grace?
12579 : Tiptoe the path of runic enlightenment? Yes, and may I never stray! Nope, I'm not that committed.
12580 : You think I would tear up as if you were tearing my heart in twain? No, I think not. Be on your way.
12581 : Straight and true flies the arrow of righteousness, and so--in a similar fashion--has your answer hit its mark.
12582 : Your first step on the way to runic enlightenment will take you into the heart of darkness...for you must procure an atrament strong enough to overcome your body's resistance to runic material.
12583 : You are charged with collecting the proper ingredient to create this ink. Keep in mind that I send you upon this task not because of my revulsion toward menial labor, but so that you may familiarize yourself with what will become your new essence.
12584 : You should be able to find % along the coast of the Yahse Hunting Grounds, at K-7.
12585 : The trail there will be long and hard; a fitting tribute to the path that lies before you.
12586 : I wish you all the best, my friend.
12587 : I can tell by the smile you're wearing that your travels did not overly wear you down. Wait but a moment and you shall have your atrament.
12588 : Now to mix the % you brought with a runic stone ground into a fine powder... Double, double, runes and rubble, Magic burn and matter bubble!
12589 : And so the preparations are complete. That incantation may have looked simple to the untrained eye, but that is only because I've distilled the process down to its very essence.
12590 : How is your constitution? While inscribing runes may not leave scars, some report that the emotional stress of the event is quite overpowering...
12591 : Not to mention the physical pain.
12592 : Well, shall we begin?
12593 : Begin the inscription? P-please be gentle! I...still harbor doubts.
12594 : That's wholly understandable, considering what's at stake. Come back once you've calmed your nerves.
12595 : Feeling a bit more brave? Let me impress upon you that the stress of inscription is only a temporary inconvenience.
12596 : The time is upon us! Now grit your teeth and prepare to feel feelings you've never felt before!
12597 : You still remain conscious, I see.
12598 : Exquisite, but that was only the end of the beginning! Now 'tis time to deploy your runes that will inscribe the heavens!
12599 : Attempt to inscribe the heavens? (#/100) Use Rune Enchantment...? ...I've had enough.
12600 : Throwing up your hands and throwing in the towel, are you? But this is only attempt number #. The only thing that awaits you should you concede now is shame. Shame that will forever haunt you and your whole family.
12601 : Shame your family and give up? Yes. No, I will persist!
12602 : ...Mayhap 'tis for the best. Let us just assume you had taken ill and we shall never speak of this again.
12603 : I am nothing if not forgiving, though. I shall give you a chance to redeem yourself whenever you see fit--if you can fit it into your busy schedule, that is.
12604 : I sense an ominous force interfering with your progress... Could it be the [/warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner/blue mage/corsair/puppetmaster/dancer/scholar/geomancer/rune fencer] within you!?
12605 : Your #th attempt and we're still no closer than before? Perhaps 'tis I who needs to train more, so I don't accidentally give the talentless dreams they can never accomplish.
12606 : I was under the impression that you were an adventurer renowned throughout the Middle Lands. Apparently that appellation amounts to little more than kindling for the fires of one's boasting.
12607 : ...My condolences, [sir/madame].
12608 : Why don't you quit while you still have your health? Many people would commit atrocities for a body as hale and hearty as yours.
12609 : Let me say this one thing: you may think you're special, but you're just as special as everyone else...that is to say, not at all.
12610 : I lost hope for you long ago, but this is already your #th time. Any further attempts would be a waste of time for us both.
12611 : Zzz...
12612 : I've had enough of your incompetence! Let me spell this out loud and clear: y-o-u c-a-n-n-o-t u-s-e r-u-n-e-s!
12613 : I might as well stick around to see if you can make it an even #.
12614 : Y-your #st try!?
12615 : Preposterous! I know my intuition has been finely honed over years of careful practice, but never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be so precise!
12616 : It looks as if my eyes know a potential rune fencer when they see one. What an accomplishment, to complete this most arduous of tasks on attempt number #!
12617 : Success on only attempt number #...? I knew you had it in you! Great job.
12618 : It took you exactly # tries to exact your victory. Well done...but I must admit you could also have done much better.
12619 : It took you all the way to attempt number #? My spleen must be producing a surplus of its humor, for I can sadly muster nothing but a melancholy response to your performance.
12620 : I cannot say much of your talents yet, but your unrelenting nature rivals that of even the hardest diamonds. It takes a special type of [man/woman] to make it all the way to attempt number #.
12621 : Congratulations on finally becoming a rune fencer. You refused to think of yourself as refuse and have come out better for it. I look forward to the day when your true talents shine forth.
12622 : I apologize if my words left you stressed instead of soothed.
12623 : I contend that my intentions were truly altruistic.
12624 : By the by, let me congratulate you once more. I may have been the fertilizer to your flower, but you would never have been able to blossom without your own ability.
12625 : I assume the world looks slightly different to you now, seeing it through the eyes of a rune fencer.
12626 : What's that? How long until the runes' effects wear off?
12627 : You need not worry about that, for it was simply a fallacy I perpetuated.
12628 : I wanted to see if you had the fire in your belly to brave the searing pain of inscription and your defeats in heated combat that are sure to come eventually.
12629 : Furthermore, even someone as loquacious as me doesn't have time to spend on every adventurer just looking to impress [his/her] comrades.
12630 : At any rate, allow me to reiterate: your runic powers will not dissipate under any circumstances.
12631 : However, that does not mean you shouldn't practice what you've learned. While yet unrefined, your power will prove quite useful in your quest to cultivate the wilds of Ulbuka.
12632 : 'Tis said that Sverdhried, the father of runic inscription, created manifold techniques that were all based off his experiences in battle. I look forward to seeing how closely you replicate his success.
12633 : On that note, I believe the time has come to present you with this.
12634 : 'Tis %, a practice blade used by every rune fencer in the world. Just remember that while the sword may choose the rune fencer, 'tis the rune fencer who swings the sword, and not the other way around.
12635 : Enjoy what is to come, [good sir/fair lady], and may you be even stronger the next time we meet.
12636 : Rune game settings. Leave it to yourself. Succeed. Fail.
12637 : Who're you? I don't know you! I can't entrust this harrowing mission of unfathomable secrecy to one whose name means less than sputum to me. Begone!
12638 : ...I've heard much of your exploits. You may just be competent enough to handle this.
12639 : Let's keep this brief. I don't want anyone getting suspicious. I'm from the Armathrwn Society, and I've been dispatched to conduct analyses for Jeuno.
12640 : Our subjects? The Naakuals.
12641 : Ugh, how can you not know of them!? And I wanted to keep this brief...
12642 : The Naakuals are the fiercest monstrosities to ever prowl Eastern Ulbuka.
12643 : While our organization lends aid to Adoulin as pioneers, our true purpose is to study these beasts. The problem is that we can't field enough men to do so.
12644 : We've been able to pinpoint their lairs, but we have no intelligence on their behavior when provoked.
12645 : With your help, though, we hope to remedy that.
12646 : Let me get this out of the way now. You'll get no reward whatsoever.
12647 : ...At least from us.
12648 : We're concerned with information, not riches. You can have whatever trinkets they're hoarding.
12649 : They're some of the most powerful beasts that we know of, so they probably have something that'll catch your eye.
12650 : The Naakuals aren't some common breed of animal to be found in every home on the continent. Their dwellings are nigh impossible to find by normal means.
12651 : I don't have time to go into the details, but we've created devices that skirt the issue and track them down for you.
12652 : Once you cross into their territory, though, the devices cease to function.
12653 : Yes, those're all we've got! They're also your only option for finding the Naakuals. These things don't come cheap, either, so start reaching into your pockets.
12654 : Gil is useless for obtaining the necessary materials around here, so I'll be needing payment in bayld.
12655 : So, what's it going to be?
12656 : What will it be? Count me in! Gimme all needed items I don't have! Gimme a device! Tell me more about the devices. I need to hear that again. Count me out for now.
12657 : Then tell no one of what transpired here. Now, away with you!
12658 : The society appreciates your help. Here, take this % with you.
12659 : It will act as our surrogate and record the information pertinent to our studies. I'll personally kill you if you lose it.
12660 : I shouldn't talk this much. Someone might see us. ...Don't ever make me do this again.
12661 : Which one do you need?
12662 : Which one do you need? %. (# bayld) %. (# bayld) %. (# bayld) %. (# bayld) %. (# bayld) %. (# bayld) None.
12663 : %? Show me # bayld and we can talk.
12664 : Give him the bayld? Might as well. No.
12665 : You're missing a total of # item[/s], which cost[s/] a grand sum of # bayld.
12666 : Proceed? (# bayld) Yes. No.
12667 : This should be everything. Go forth and fight for the good of the city!
12668 : Quit fooling around! This isn't a game, you hear!? Time is of the essence, so give me the right amount of bayld.
12669 : Take it and be on your way. You never met with me, remember.
12670 : Take them and be on your way. You never met with me, remember.
12671 : Make it quick...and act like we're talking about the weather or something. Now, which do you need to know about?
12672 : About which do you need to know? %. %. %. %. %. %. None.
12673 : The % leads you to the lair of [Colkhab, the Matriarch Naakual/Tchakka, the Riptide Naakual/Achuka, the Firebrand Naakual/Yumcax, the Ligneous Naakual/Hurkan, the Booming Naakual/Kumhau, the Flashfrost Naakual], in [Ceizak Battlegrounds/Foret de Hennetiel/Morimar Basalt Fields/Yorcia Weald/Marjami Ravine/Kamihr Drifts].
12674 : You may only have audience with this testy queen once you pass through a grove with thorns so sharp that they've claimed many an unguarded limb.
12675 : Cover yourself in this net for protection. You'll never be able to withstand the bushes that guard the entrance otherwise.
12676 : The lair of this aquatic lancer lies on the far bank of the Zoldeff River. You'll need to be sufficiently skilled at piloting watercraft in order to reach it.
12677 : This %, which uses the same technology as airships, will take you where you need to go. Sadly, the forces emitted by Naakuals' lairs will destroy it once you get too close.
12678 : That shouldn't matter, though. You won't have any more use for it once you get there anyway.
12679 : The lair of this magma-belching behemoth is closed off by scorching hot boulders.
12680 : Equip this armor with heat-resistant properties and you should last long enough to at least be stomped to a paste.
12681 : The Debuggery Fame ON! Fame OFF! It's my first time. My sophomore attempt. Accepted that quest! The Event Begins.
12682 : You'll never have a chance to lay eyes on this airborne arbor unless you're able to part the throng of overgrown trees that stifles your path.
12683 : They do little to inspire fear in those who approach them, but not a single surveyor I've talked to who left without carrying a special growth retardant has come back as sane as he left. Honestly, I wouldn't either after seeing three trees rise up for every one I chopped down.
12684 : The effects of the formula may be strong, but it won't leave a lasting impact on the surrounding environs. The actual tree you douse with it, though? You won't even be able to use it for kindling.
12685 : This avian monstrosity's den isn't too hard to discern, what with all the vines digging into the sheer cliff that leads up to it.
12686 : A [lad/lass] as smart as you probably knows this already, but you'll need to learn how to scale these vines and render the saber-like thorns that protrude from them harmless.
12687 : Regrettably, the thorns aren't the biggest of your worries. Hurkan's called the Booming Naakual for a reason, and even the vines that guard his roost ring with the terrible sound of thunder and shock those foolish enough to touch them without a dampening agent.
12688 : I should caution you that while this mixture does away with electrical charges exceptionally fast, it only lasts about as long as it will take for you to climb the vines. I also can't recommend using it in quick succession.
12689 : This ice beast's stomping grounds shouldn't be hard to discern, for they're marked by a conglomeration of snow that stretches high enough to bury the valley in which it resides.
12690 : Climbing this palisade of precipitation is one thing, but the land's topography also creates some harrowingly strong winds that've left countless frozen corpses scattered in pieces across its ridges.
12691 : If you want to even get near the foot of it, you'll need this mountaineering set. It should keep you insulated against the harsh, biting winds and arctic temperatures as well as tethered to the ground.
12692 : Each individual piece of clothing in the set is woven with rare and experimental fibers that increases the production of body heat, then retain it to an astounding degree. We say it's experimental, though, because the effect only lasts long enough to get you over the hump and into the lion's den.
12693 : I ain't never seen no whippersnapper with your face in these parts. Say...mightn't ya've come across any simulacrum segments while ya were out thwick-thwackin' through Eastern Ulbuka?
12694 : What you say, [sonny/missy]? You ain't know what simulacrum segments are!?
12695 : Well, they's three of a kind. You've got your heads, your torsos, and your legs. Puttin' 'em t'gether's the 'ard part, though. Most young'uns say they ain't got no time to learn 'ow.
12696 : Me, though? I've got all the time in the world. In fact, my middle name be Time. Wait, but what was my last name...?
12697 : Anyway, I makes my livin' off tinkerin' with simulacra. I'd be 'appy to build one for ya if you're willin' to slip me somethin' in return and listen to how I dun fished up a doozy of a craklaw once!
12698 : Ya ain't gotta doubt me none with them eyes of yours, little [lad/lass]. I know these're your prop'ty. I ain't gon' steal 'em.
12699 : If ya 'appen upon some simulacrum segments in the wilds of Eastern Ulbuka, couldja make an ol' man with nothin' better to do 'appy and gimme some to tinker with?
12700 : Hey, I remember you! You're...Smeirdlin, right? What's on the docket today?
12701 : Well, well, well, well, well, well, well! Lookit what we've got 'ere... A natural collector, you.
12702 : Iff'n you'll be needin' that slapped t'gether or whatnot, just slip it into these shaky hands o' mine.
12703 : Why, color me cockeyed! You've got some obsidian fragments on ya. Iff'n you ain't be needin' them none, 'ow 'bout floatin' some my way...purty please?
12704 : My, oh my, oh my! Them obsidian fragments be twinklin' and gleamin' like spit-shined shoes. I think I sees my reflection in 'em!
12705 : Sorry, I'm easily distracted these days. Where was I? Oh, yeah, did I ever tell ya how much I love buildin' simulacra?
12706 : ...I did? Hm...well, I also like collectin' 'em.
12707 : Iff'n you'd have a heart bigger than the Celennia Memorial Library and give me one, I'd dun make it worth your while, that's fo' sho'.
12708 : Ya can 'ave some segments from my super-secret collection, so humor an ol' man and gimme, gimme, gimme!
12709 : What will you do? Leave. Check your simulacrum. Dismantle a simulacrum. Check your eudaemon. Dismantle a eudaemon. Trade for segments from his collection.
12710 : Ya want me to have a look-see at those [simulacrum/eudaemon] pieces o' yours? Great! But which ones?
12711 : Check which [simulacrum/eudaemon]'s segments? None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12712 : What's that, [sonny/missy]? %? Lessee...
12713 : %!
12714 : Did I 'ear ya say dismantle? I guess I cain't say They don't make 'em like they used to, because no one makes 'em anymore! Anyway, that's what these segments are for.
12715 : Dismantle which [simulacrum/eudaemon]? None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12716 : Dismantle %? You heard me. Whoops! No, thanks.
12717 : I'm willin' to do this for ya an' all, but what's the point iff'n I cain't give 'em back? You got stuff practic'ly cascadin' out your satchel!
12718 : Do dum diddly dak. Now that I've dismantled your simulacrum, 'ow many pieces d'ya get back?
12719 : You brought some obsidian fragments for me!? Ya shouldn't have...but I'm so glad ya did! Take anythin' ya want. Anythin' at all!
12720 : Select a segment. (# fragment[/s]) No, thanks. %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) Previous page. Next page.
12721 : What a beaut, this %. You'll give 'er a good 'ome, won't ya?
12722 : Give % a good home? With pleasure. I'd rather not.
12723 : Just because I ain't got all my marbles don't mean ya can try to stiff me on obsidian fragments! Lucky fer you I'll forget in a few minutes...
12724 : Sorrah, no super secret treasures from my collection if ya cain't even find the time to empty your pack.
12725 : Whoa, whoa, whoa! I 'ppreciate the gusto, but my mind just ain't the most agile. I need the three diff'rent pieces all at the same time...or four dependin' on the type. Didn't my wife tell ya that?
12726 : Looks like ya caught a bit o' my senility, [sonny/missy]. I think you've already got a [simulacrum/eudaemon] for this location.
12727 : There ain't no need for more'n one. I speak from experience, 'ere. Let's just pretend this ne'er 'appened.
12728 : This head, that torso, these legs... I think I'm gonna need # gil for this job.
12729 : Have him assemble %? Yes. No.
12730 : Hold your chocobos, young'un! You cain't rush genius!
12731 : Twist 'ere, prod there... Get in there, dammit... Get the holy hell in there! Grrr...
12732 : Whew, feast your peepers on this humdinger! Ain't never seen somethin' so seamless, 'ave ya? And it's all yours, bairn.
12733 : If your mem'ry's a bit fuzzy on what to do with these simulacra, go chat up my ol' lady for a bit. I wouldn't wanna spoil the surprise none.
12734 : Ya dun found some proverbial diamonds in the rough, didja?
12735 : Lemme take a gander at 'em. Hmmm... By golly, they should be fittin' tighter'n my ol' lady's britches after a Darksday brunch.
12736 : But 'ow'n I go 'bout it be a differnt beast alt'gether. I guess I's just gots ta wing it.
12737 : If ya be wantin' me to work my magic, I'll needs me the visage, torso, legs, and...
12738 : ...And whatever that newfangled thingamabob segment be all at once. Ya 'ear me? All four at the same time, [sonny/missy].
12739 : I know I fancy myself a tinkerer, but I ain't no miracle worker! Ya just cain't assemble nothin' with this 'ere 'ead.
12740 : Ya've heard the whole shebang from Granny o'er there, yeah?
12741 : 'Course, I cain't remember gobsmack 'bout no demon.
12742 : Th'only thang I done can do is r'member a gapin' hole in my mem'ry.
12743 : Weren't so much that I couldn't set foot in skirmishes no more...
12744 : More that I ferget what 'twas like ta live.
12745 : Yer sayin' that our unborn daughter was tak'n from us and that she's alive in a skirmish?
12746 : I cain't even 'magine what that mus' be like for her...
12747 : What good could these old bones be to one as spry as yourself?
12748 : A simulacrum...yes, you could say I've heard tales of such objects. This sap over here is a fan of collecting such dangerous articles.
12749 : They may not look special, but I swear by all the gray hairs on this head that they contain latent hermetical energies.
12750 : Yes...and harnessing such energies grants the bearer the ability to manipulate time and space itself.
12751 : Would you think me mad if I told you that they were keys to another dimension?
12752 : Do you believe her story? Anything is possible. She's clearly off her rocker.
12753 : It is good to see that not all youth have abandoned the realm of possibility.
12754 : I suppose I cannot fault you for doubting, as my word is the only proof I offer.
12755 : It is as I said before--the power is real. Find an augural conveyor, hold up the simulacrum, and watch the magic begin.
12756 : What magic? Tohoho, far be it from me to spoil the fun!
12757 : You remind me so much of my [grandson/granddaughter]. [He/She] must be around your age, and always asking questions instead of going to find the answer for [himself/herself]. But I say that there's no better teacher than experience.
12758 : But heavens, have I finally reached the age when I've started to lecture youngsters? Let's nip that one in the bud.
12759 : As I was saying, the simulacra provide a gateway to places known as skirmishes. Skirmishes look, smell, and sound exactly like Vana'diel.
12760 : Don't give me that look. How am I supposed to know why such a world exists? I'm just an old woman, not some learned sage! What I can tell you is that the simulacra are the key to entering a skirmish.
12761 : When he and I were younger, we used to visit there the way those kids used to play hide-and-seek in the Rala Waterways.
12762 : We had all manner of interesting experiences there--but I'm sure that's a story you've no interest in hearing.
12763 : Maybe I'm repeating myself--age'll do that to you--but if you want to enter a skirmish, you must first find a lek of black butterflies.
12764 : Of course, young one, this was all a long time ago. I don't even know if skirmishes continue to exist, or what form they may take today. All I ask is that you make careful preparations if you decide to visit such a dangerous area.
12765 : Of course, I wouldn't fault you if you wanted to use the simulacrum as simply a lovely conversation piece to adorn your hearth.
12766 : But that look in your eyes--I can tell that you won't be satisfied until you try it out for yourself.
12767 : Gwehehe, these rickety bones felt the same when they were young.
12768 : If you ever want to know more about skirmishes, you know where to find me.
12769 : Hmm? In need of some of granny's musings?
12770 : Have any questions? None in particular. Tell me about skirmishes. Tell me how to access a skirmish. Tell me about the simulacra. Tell me about mysterious eddies. Tell me about skirmish prerequisites. Tell me about skirmish battles. Next page.
12771 : I wish I could tell you why skirmishes exist, or how long they've been there, but even the wisdom of an old woman has its limits. What I do know, though, is that physically speaking they're indistinguishable from our world.
12772 : Augural conveyors serve as gateways to where skirmishes take place. Find one, and you'll find your way there.
12773 : To make your way in, you'll need to hold up a simulacrum to the conveyor.
12774 : Did I remember to mention that each entrance requires a different simulacrum? No?... <Sigh> They say you're only as old as you feel, but right now I feel like ancient ruins.
12775 : I don't know if there is some strange benefactor who controls the skirmishes, but the fact that % magically appears in your bag when you teleport there makes me think so. Using this object will enable you to return to our world. It's all very mysterious.
12776 : That way, even if you're in over your head, you can still find your way out. Just don't go losing it, okay?
12777 : Let me see if I can recall all the details... Yes, that's right. Here's what I can remember--but don't blame me if things have changed in the meantime!
12778 : One was located in Rala Waterways, in a small cubbyhole to the west.
12779 : Another was deep within the northernmost regions of Cirdas Caverns.
12780 : Oh, yes, that old man of mine just loves his simulacra... Chiseling out their faces, collecting fresh herbs to grind into paint, and... Wait, what were we talking about?
12781 : Oh, right, skirmishes. Sorry about that. For skirmishes, the simulacra are divided up into three sections. The way you combine the segments determines what happens in the particular skirmish that you enter.
12782 : These three parts--the visage, the torso, the legs--each play a role in influencing the skirmish.
12783 : Of course, I don't remember which part does what. Sometimes I'm lucky I remember to put on my blouse rightside-in each morning.
12784 : I don't want to say the possibilities are limitless...but there certainly are a lot of them, tohoho!
12785 : If you do decide to go and discover anything interesting along the way, be sure to share your findings with gramps over there. He lives for this sort of thing.
12786 : Swirling pools of power known as Noetic Ascensions dot the landscape of a skirmish.
12787 : The number of eddies seems to vary with...the combination of simulacrum segments? ...Prevailing weather patterns? ...Chocobo mating rituals?
12788 : Bah! I can never keep all this nonsense straight.
12789 : Dear me, I've really started losing it. What I can say for certain, though, is that you should take the time to harvest the eddies. They will help you somehow, I'm sure of it!
12790 : Once you have # segment[/s] of a [simulacrum/eudaemon], trade them together to Oston, who will create a completed [simulacrum/eudaemon] for you in return.
12791 : To access a skirmish, the party leader must be in possession of a [simulacrum/eudaemon] and find an augural conveyor.
12792 : Talking to the augural conveyor will transport all party members to this alternate realm of wonder.
12793 : Back in the day, we'd try to push it to the limits and once got as many as # people in a party! On the other hand, we were never able to go with fewer than #.
12794 : Only those of level 95 or higher are granted access to [alluvion /]skirmishes.
12795 : You may only spend a total of between # and # minute[/s] (Earth time) in [a skirmish/an alluvion skirmish] before being removed from the area. The amount of time changes depending on which combination of segments you have assembled.
12796 : After the time has passed, you will be transported back to Vana'diel proper. A bit draconian, perhaps, but each simulacrum only holds so much power.
12797 : If # minute[/s] (Earth time) pass[es/] without any of your companions residing inside the [alluvion /]skirmish, the realm will dematerialize.
12798 : If you wish to return to this world before the battle is done, you may use % to leave. All other party members will remain inside.
12799 : However, you may not reenter [a skirmish/an alluvion skirmish] once you have left.
12800 : If you manage to complete the objectives you will inevitably receive once inside, you will receive %.
12801 : Using this % will obliterate all remaining foes and conjure a treasure coffer. As yet another testament to the realm's strange nature, each participant will find their own rewards upon opening the coffer.
12802 : In addition, the amount of time remaining before you are teleported away will be reset to # minute[/s].
12803 : Make sure to claim your spoils before time expires.
12804 : Might I add that fulfilling one condition will activate a second for you to attempt?
12805 : Completing this secondary objective will increase the rewards that you receive. Keep this in mind as you continue.
12806 : Ohoho, my dear, have you gotten hold of one of the skirmishes' most precious items?
12807 : You know what I mean--%.
12808 : I went on skirmishes so much when I was a bit more spry and these legs didn't turn to jelly just from climbing staircases, but never once did I get my hands on such a treasure. As for you, though...
12809 : Hmm...with that terrible travesty you call armor, even entering a skirmish must be a Starlight Celebration miracle.
12810 : But what a twinkle I see in your eyes! Yes, you remind me of my younger days.
12811 : You thirst for adventure in faraway worlds.
12812 : I've stored the trinkets I've found over the years, hoping one day they would be put to good use--and maybe their time has come. Of course, [sonny/dearie], all things have their price.
12813 : And don't think I'll let you steal all my hard-won trophies just because you have something shiny. You'll have to work for it, just as I did!
12814 : You might look tough, but I'd bet every wrinkle on my body that there's even more fight inside of you. Come to think of it, that's a bet I wouldn't mind losing, tohoho!
12815 : Anyway! To acquire them, you'll need to try your luck in some skirmishes.
12816 : Once you've got some, come back here and see me. I'll let you pick out something from my ancient collection.
12817 : You need some guidance? Let Granny Lola help shine some of that old-time wisdom on you.
12818 : What would you like information on? Nothing in particular. Skirmishes in general. Skirmish entrances. Simulacra. Noetic ascensions. %. I want to exchange %. I want my % returned. %. I want to exchange %. I want my % returned. Conditions for participating. Skirmish battles. Next page.
12819 : The wings, is it? Yes, quite mysterious items, indeed.
12820 : Let me share with you some insight: though one man's time on Vana'diel is limited, his curiosity stretches for eons.
12821 : Even I once thought that chasing something so boundless was a fool's errand...but I was wrong.
12822 : In my younger days, I chased after dreams like my crazy husband chased after women, yet I never stopped to think about why. Why I chased dreams, that is. I know why that letch chased women.
12823 : The devil is in the details, they say, but I disagree. Don't worry about the little things--just enjoy the time you're given.
12824 : Goodness, have I gone on about nothing in particular again? I really must stop doing that. What now? Beats me.
12825 : What I do know is that everything skirmish creates has to do with those odd flitty thingamajigs.
12826 : The answers you seek must lie within the skirmishes. Other than that, words fail me.
12827 : Looking to get [some of my armor/a bit of what I've got on me], hmm? Take a look at what I've got to offer.
12828 : Which item? (Total: #) None of these. %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) Previous page. Next page.
12829 : This %? You're absolutely sure?
12830 : Proceed with the exchange? (Wings: #.) Yes. No.
12831 : And I thought I was bad at arithmetic something fierce! You can't even remember how much stuff costs long enough to pay, can you? You'll need to get more % before I can give that to you!
12832 : Is that % I see? Here, let Granny keep ahold of any you got.
12833 : I'm holding a total of # % for you. Just speak up when you want to exchange them for some of my [armor/stuff].
12834 : Toho, you want your % back? And Granny was keeping them nice and safe for you, too...
12835 : I'm holding a total of #. Just how many do I need to part with?
12836 : #? Understood, young cub. There you go.
12837 : I mightn't got a head for numbers, but returning zero means I keep all of them for you. Let me know if you change your mind.
12838 : I'm only holding # for you, but you want more? I may be old, but not that old!
12839 : I'm already holding such a huge number that I can't possibly keep any more! Granny isn't your personal pack mule!
12840 : Your bags are full, [sonny/lassie]. You'll need to make some room first.
12841 : There's yet another deep within Yorcia Weald. Beware the dense jungles if you decide to make the trek.
12842 : Tohoho, my young friend. You've already gotten ahold of %!
12843 : It brings me back to a time when my bosoms were a bit perkier and I, too, ventured across the land with a spring in my step...
12844 : With those taut calves of yours, you must surely be an adventurer just as capable as I used to be.
12845 : It makes me think back on old times with my compatriots. We were so young then...
12846 : With my geomancy and the old geezer's runes, not even the slimiest umbril stood in our way!
12847 : But skirmishes...those were entirely different challenges indeed.
12848 : Yet my trusty luopan and that fatty's enchanted wards won the day, boy howdy!
12849 : We darted past traps, cleaved dread foes in two, and proceeded ever further into the otherworldly realm.
12850 : Say...if you happen to try your hand at more skirmishes, would you bring an old woman some %?
12851 : I would tell you that respecting your elders' wishes would be reward enough, but, if you're anything like I used to be, I know you'll be wanting more.
12852 : Allow me to sweeten the pot--in exchange for those mementos, I will happily part with a little something I used on my own jaunts into the ether.
12853 : Tohoho, I promise that they've been stored properly, so you won't have to worry that pretty little head of yours about fifty years of sweat and mildew!
12854 : Tohoho, you wish to know why Granny is interested in such trinkets?
12855 : This'll be a bit rambly, but let me tell you a story. A story of love and betrayal. A story of victory and defeat. A story...of Lola.
12856 : I have been through many skirmishes--some vexing, but all of them brutal. The foes were always numerous, and we were under assault from all sides.
12857 : My legs began to buckle, and I feared I'd never again taste the sweet, succulent apples grown in the Civic Arboretum.
12858 : When claws were about to rend me limb from limb, I flinched, twisting to the side--and my bag full of % absorbed what would surely have been the killing blow.
12859 : I swear upon all that is holy that my heart stopped for a good ten seconds. My comrades let out a cry of joy when they saw I was unscathed.
12860 : But Gramps--he was not so lucky. A fierce slash cut right above his kneecap, and he still bears that scar to this day--all because he didn't have %.
12861 : I felt so bad for him. Venturing into further skirmishes with such a grievous wound was out of the question, but I never wanted to leave his side--so I married the old coot.
12862 : And on the night of our honeymoon, we... Well, let's just say Granny used to be quite limber.
12863 : Toho, I told you the story would be a doozy!
12864 : Maybe now you see why I want some of those things. They are wonderful memories of the best years of my life.
12865 : Now you understand why I am willing to part with my trinkets for what, at the surface, are worthless pieces of junk.
12866 : If I recall, there's yet another in Ra'Kaznar, in a room near the upper level entrance.
12867 : Exchange for which? (Total: #). On second thought, nothing. Key items. Items.
12868 : Exchange for which? (Total: #) I've changed my mind. % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). % (# needed). Previous page. Next page.
12869 : %, [sonny/lassie]? Good choice.
12870 : As a special bonus, I'll trade you % for a total of # wings, and % for a total of # wings.
12871 : Young'un, where'd you get your hands on that?
12872 : It's another one of those segments, isn't it?
12873 : A bit different from the normal simulacra, to be sure...but I feel the same faint energies.
12874 : I'm sure old gramps over there'd love to have a look at it.
12875 : You know him--he can create something outta nothing!
12876 : See? I'm not any old weathered crone, despite the way you rolled your eyes at me earlier.
12877 : I'd like to call them a new kind of simulacrum, but isn't that name a bit tiresome?
12878 : I've got to come up with something better... Why don't we call it a eudaemon?
12879 : And the skirmishes they're attuned to need a moniker that'll just knock your socks off! Let's see...
12880 : ...
12881 : Hmm? You think I would go and pass out like that, right here at this table? Granny may be past her prime, but she's not one to nod off in the middle of a conversation!
12882 : Hmm... Hmmmmmm...
12883 : I've got it! We'll call them alluvion skirmishes!
12884 : Tohoho, My brain can keep up where my body can't, that's for sure!
12885 : And since you've got one of those eudaemons, I've got a special task for you.
12886 : You might find a pernicious fiend on the other side of those living cairns.
12887 : If you see him, ask him what the future holds.
12888 : My own future may be a bit shorter than I'd care to admit, yet I can't help but be a bit curious.
12889 : So you learned...nothing.
12890 : But you did manage to meet him, and it makes me wonder...
12891 : Just what lies beyond? I've searched for dozens of years, and these wrinkly old fingers have never grasped the answer.
12892 : How can granny help you today? I require nothing. Tell me about alluvion skirmishes. Tell me how to join alluvion skirmishes. Tell me about eudaemon. Tell me about alluvion prerequisites. Tell me about alluvion battles. Previous page.
12893 : Well, these old bones're pretty sure they're similar to ordinary skirmishes, but I've never set foot inside the alluvion ones.
12894 : And if they're truly like cousins, then you'd need to find an augural conveyor to get in. Simple, right?
12895 : Don't expect to just touch those butterflies and be magically whisked away. You'll need a eudaemon to enter.
12896 : Remember how you needed parts corresponding to a particular area for an ordinary skirmish? Well, call it an old woman's intuition, but I'll bet eudaemons are similar.
12897 : Maybe you're still sprightly and full of life, but don't expect to waltz into a skirmish without the right eudaemon!
12898 : Tohoho, and I'll bet you'll still find one of those % in your back pocket upon entering.
12899 : Just throw 'em up in the air when you get lost, and poof! Back to the real world you go.
12900 : Not too bad, right? Boy howdy, I've still got it!
12901 : The entrances? Hmm... If an alluvion skirmish is still a skirmish, then I bet the entrances are in the same places.
12902 : One's located down in Rala Waterways, in a small room on the western side.
12903 : Another's in the deepest, northernmost recesses of Cirdas Caverns.
12904 : You know, people call me a windbag who's always flapping her gums, but I gotta say--the fact that there are more than just three parts to these new eudaemons leaves me speechless...almost.
12905 : My spine positively tingles at the energies contained in those contraptions.
12906 : You know granny is a geomancer, but did you know she also used to be a renowned fortune teller?
12907 : The two together mean that no one in all Vana'diel's better at reading ley lines and sensing the flow of magic!
12908 : But dear me, I'm babbling again. Suffice to say, the ephemeral powers tell me that alluvion skirmishes are always changing and shifting, never the same place twice.
12909 : Couldn't tell you exactly how, though, never having been there myself. Just don't run off and get yourself trapped.
12910 : We've been through a lot together, so I drafted a little book to help you with skirmishes if you ever need a refresher. Maybe you're not as forgetful as me, but it sure couldn't hurt!
12911 : One of your pioneer friends blabbed to me about finding an entrance deep within the jungles of Yorcia Weald.
12912 : If Granny's joints didn't ache so much, she would join you there herself.
12913 : There's this pretty young thing out in Yorcia Weald...Lorissa...
12914 : Your future.
12915 : Yes...
12916 : You remember when I spun that tale about Gramps's mishap that left him crippled? There's a bit more to it.
12917 : Skirmishes aren't all roses and butterflies--though there are a lot of butterflies, hoo boy. And when one of those winged buggers blinked into existence, so too did a fiend. He was staring into the depths of Gramps's soul.
12918 : I darn near had to rub my eyes because it looked like he was smiling--laughing!--at us.
12919 : Your friend there is about to kick the bucket, don't you think?
12920 : I left my pocketwatch back in the green room, but I'm sure he's only got a few ticks left.
12921 : Humanity can be so...squishy. One little flick and you go splat.
12922 : But you've made it past the prologue and got all the way here. Impressive.
12923 : You know what? I like you. Bwehehe!
12924 : And because I like you, I'll offer you a deal.
12925 : Your future in exchange for your lives.
12926 : Now you see, Granny's never had a head for riddles.
12927 : But she did see Oston suffering, and so she decided that she would save him, no matter the cost.
12928 : His chuckle turned into a howl, echoing off the walls and shattering the light.
12929 : And then there wasn't one butterfly but dozens...hundreds...their wings flapping feverishly as they surrounded us in murky gloom.
12930 : When I came to, we were flat on our backs in Rala Waterways.
12931 : I hobbled over to Oston, hoisted him onto my back, and lumbered all the way to the Order of Janniston.
12932 : Took a couple weeks, but eventually the old coot returned to health.
12933 : And the future that brute talked of? It was none other than our daughter.
12934 : We'd never seen her and had no real parental bond, but sometimes you can just tell, hmm?
12935 : Hopefully she turned out well...
12936 : My legs don't work like they used to, so there's no way I could go see her myself.
12937 : But tell her that her parents are here...waiting...
12938 : Ah yes, who can forget the smell of Eastern Ulbuka. Fetid jungles, noxious rrrivers, and sulfurous magma. It's enough to bring a tear to the eye.
12939 : But you know what gets me even more excited? Tiny caves filled with trrreasure dotting the landscape!
12940 : Gee, you know what would be positively wonderrrful? If some strong pioneer were to go down there and beat up the monsters guarding it! You wouldn't happen to know any, would you?
12941 : Oh, what's this now? You're a pioneerrr? I had expected someone with a bit more...panache. Still, while you're here, mind smashing some skulls?
12942 : But wait--those arrrms of yours are like twigs! <Sigh> Waiting for the right [man/woman] to come around is such a pain...
12943 : Why, yes, a specimen such as yourself will do purrrfectly! Caught like a mouse, you are!
12944 : Just let me work a little hocus-pocus and...there! Now you're ready to go delving for trrreasure! Right? I'm not going to let you turn back!
12945 : Ready for some spelunking? My gear's as good as on! Caves, eew...
12946 : Wh-what? This is trrreasure we're talking about here! Riches abound! Woo the [woman/man] of your dreams...or the [man/woman] of your dreams, if you're into that! Not that I care about you people either way.
12947 : Wow, you might be dependable after all! There's no need to ink our deal on parchment--I've already collected a hair sample in case I need to curse you for betraying me. Here's how it works: I discover the probable location of a treasure, and you go out and find it for me. Wrap your pea brain around that one.
12948 : You must be brrrimming with questions. I suppose even the simplest of explanations would confound you, but...bah. Just ask away.
12949 : What will you ask of her? Explain the whole shebang. Yantric planchette defusion. Receive rewards. Nothing at this time.
12950 : The whole shebang? <Sigh> I've had to explain this so many times, I had all the answers engrrraved on pieces of leather!
12951 : The following topics are inscribed on the vellum.
12952 : Learn about which topic? Treasures. Fractures. Obscured domains. Mweya plasm. Yantric planchettes. Yggrete. Yggrete shards. Yggzi beads. Not interested at the moment.
12953 : Let me get a look at your...what? You don't have a yantric planchette!? Well, then, get crrracking! Find me some yggrete before I kick your butt back to Jeuno!
12954 : You've got a yantrrric planchette, but...what's this? It has no yggzi beads? Bah, I didn't think someone could be this useless until I met you.
12955 : Let's prrroceed!
12956 : Examine which item? %. %. %. %. %. %. Never mind.
12957 : %. That'll do, adventurerrr. That'll do.
12958 : And what shall we do with this, hmm?
12959 : What now? Check the %. Remove yggzi beads. Do nothing.
12960 : Let me get a good look.  Why, this is just a normal %! No yggzi beads, nothing!
12961 : I've got a cat's eye for this sort of thing. Just let me...
12962 : %.
12963 : Yup, that's it. # of 'em, too!
12964 : Stand back beforrre you get hurt, young cub, and let  work her magic!
12965 : Remove which? %. %. %. %. %. None.
12966 : Sure you want to rrremove that %? If you back out after I do it...things are going to end badly.
12967 : Are you sure? Positive. Wait, I need time to think...
12968 : Hmph. I'll forrrgive you for wasting my time--just this once.
12969 : Hah! Easy as pie.
12970 : removed the %.
12971 : Need to make any other adjustments?
12972 : There's nothing for me to tinkerrr with here.
12973 : Oh? Looks like your sack is full. Come back once you've emptied it out.[ As much as I'd like to do it for you, I shouldn't touch something so purrrsonal without permission./]
12974 : Of courrrse, what good is an adventurer without [his/her] spoils? Too bad for you, sweet cheeks, that you might not be interested in what I'm looking for.
12975 : You might think me a bit rrrough around the edges, but I assure you that I am an academic of the highest caliber. I would claw someone's eyes out to get ahold of what's beyond those veils!
12976 : ...But monsters aren't my forrrte. Here's the deal. You go bash their faces in and bring me back what they're guarding. Anything the monsters have in their possession is yours. I couldn't care less.
12977 : And if you find anything out of the orrrdinary, you'd better bring it to me or I'll hunt you down. Yes, find a total of # of what I need and I'll throw in something else to sweeten the pot.
12978 : Have you got lint in your earrrs? A fracture is a fracture! You know, a mystical underground cave. They've got to have them back where you come from--or are you really that oblivious? As to the details...well, these are untamed wilds, after all. Expect the unexpected.
12979 : That's why I'm licking my lips at the thought of finding arrrcane knowledge! Yes, think of the pow... <Cough, cough> What I mean to say is...
12980 : Even finding these fractures is a burrrden. You catch a glimpse of rocky entrance, only to see it fade into mist. Yes, the treasures are always a paw ahead. Never more, never less.
12981 : To be frrrank with you, I don't understand much about this whole ordeal. What I do know is that you need a yantric planchette to even have a prayer of finding the real entrance.
12982 : These yantric planchettes don't make themselves, my pet. They're crrrafted from only the finest yggrete--and no one can fashion them but me.
12983 : You see where I'm going with this, or do I have to carrrve it into your flesh? First the stone. Then the planchette. Then the fracture. Then the treasure. Is that comprehensible enough?
12984 : Yes...do this and all the plunderrr will be ripe for the plucking. Hunting fish in a barrel...unless the creatures lurking below get to you first.
12985 : Mweya plasm is a substance of grrreat power found coating the scales and flesh of fiends beyond the veils.
12986 : Its white sheen and otherworldly luster...hmm... <Cough> Hmph! Either way I have no use for it. Strange as the untamed wilds, it's well sought after by the Inventors' Coalition.
12987 : I'm usually not one to be concerned about the prrractical implications of such things, but think of the possibilities! I said think, damn you! <Sigh> I'm sure those inventors back in Western Adoulin will trade you trinkets for even just a drop of the stuff.
12988 : I'm more than just sharp claws and a prrretty face--I'm also the only one who can make yantric planchettes! That's why I'm here!
12989 : You're completely useless unless you trade me yggrrrete so I can make one.
12990 : Why? <Scowl> Because you can't find the extra-dimensional entrrrances and step inside without one!
12991 : <Sigh>
12992 : Stop looking at me like that. No, I don't know why it worrrks that way, okay? That's why I've got to study these things!
12993 : Oh, and another thing, tenderpaws--once you've used a yantric planchette, it crrrumbles into dust and becomes completely useless.
12994 : Of course, it goes without saying that the yggrete becomes totally useless, too. And before you ask--no, I won't give a damn if you come back to me crrrying and bawling. I'll just laugh in your face.
12995 : Yggrete are petrified pieces of wood from a tree said to contain mystical powerrrs. But they're hard as rock--just like your head, evidently--so you can think of them as stones.
12996 : They come in many colors depending on the latent energies within. It's those enerrrgies I need to make a yantric planchette.
12997 : The color of the yggrete deterrrmines what entrance it leads to. See how nice I am, spending all my time to supply you with this imporrrtant information?
12998 : Why are they called yggrete? Really? <Sigh> There's no helping some people. Suffice to say, it's one of nature's grrreatest mysteries.
12999 : So if you come across any yggrete, just trrrade them to me so I can make you a yantric planchette. With that, you can go bash some brains in to help me find what I need! I trust you can do that much.
13000 : So, you want to know what yggrete shards are? Someone really needs to slap some sense into you--might as well be me. They're...sharrrds of yggrete.
13001 : I shouldn't fault you too much, though, because they aren't used in the same way. No, these are used to call monsterrrs to you.
13002 : They can also be condensed into mweya plasm...if you desirrre.
13003 : Use them once and they become inert and sterrrile, just like...never mind. Don't be an idiot by using them when you don't mean to.
13004 : Yggzi beads are another forrrm of yggrete. You know, magic and all.
13005 : By infusing a yantric planchette with these mystic beads, you can prevent certain monsters from approaching you--now, if only they could stop idiots from apprrroaching me.
13006 : Each yantric planchette can be infused with up to three yggzi beads. Might as well try them for yourself, no?
13007 : Having all this talent is tough enough--I don't need to be doing other people's dirrrty work, too.
13008 : They can also be turned into mweya plasm just like yggrete shards. A plebeian like you doesn't need any of that, though.
13009 : So you brrrought me %? And I was about to pounce on you for wasting my time. Let me get a good look...
13010 : Perfect! Easy as unrrraveling a ball of yarn.
13011 : Here you go--your very own %. Purrrfect for finding those [fractures/obscured domains].
13012 : You've already got %? So you were wasting my time! Get out of my sight, and be thankful I'm rrreturning this stone to you at all!
13013 : What's this now? You want me to attach your:
13014 : - %
13015 : ...right? Let me just scratch a couple etchings in here and...
13016 : Grrraaaaaah!
13017 : I was grrracious enough to attach the following to your %:
13018 : -%
13019 : That should be it for now.
13020 : What? Do I have some catnip on my face?
13021 : Anyway, herrre you go.
13022 : Maybe I shouldn't get so frrrustrated at you for this, but I can't put multiple stones of the same type onto one yantric planchette. The energies would cancel each other out.
13023 : Have you got brrricks for brains? Only a total of # bead[/s] can be placed in a yantric planchette!
13024 : You can't be serious... %? H-how could a nitwit such as you possibly have...?
13025 : I must say that you've surrrpassed my expectations. A nicer person might congrrratulate you.
13026 : You're worthy of the moniker adventurerrr...or was it pioneer now?
13027 : If you're feeling lucky, you can try your hand at one of the other fractures. If you did it once, then you might even be able to do it again...against all my expectations.
13028 : (Yes, yes...with such command of the aetherrr, [he/she]...)
13029 : H-huh? Those fractures must be wreaking havoc on your ears. I didn't say a damned thing, and I'll rrrake your face if you say otherwise!
13030 : Look who came crrrawling back in fail... What!? %!? You did it again!?
13031 : How could you possibly have accomplished such a feat, what with those chicken bones you call legs?
13032 : And if that weren't eye-popping enough, those inventorrr folk came barreling over here talking about new items they've discovered in exchange for mweya plasm. Like I care about such things!
13033 : You must be drrripping with the stuff by now, so pay them a visit before they come back to assault my ears with their meaningless drivel.
13034 : You've come this far--fancy yourself up to the challenge of explorrring the third cave for me, or are you going to Moblin your way out of it?
13035 : Enough pawing around! Get off your haunches and... Huh? You actually got %!? Unbelievable!
13036 : I chalked the first two times up to serendipity, but to have done it again... Yes, my rrresearch will advance by leaps and bounds!
13037 : At first I thought you were so wet behind the earrrs that I could water my plants with your face, but this is something else. You've somehow managed to acquire all three treasures!
13038 : I suppose I owe you something--a leftoverrr from my machinations. I have no need of it.
13039 : Did I say machinations? No, I don't believe I did, and I'll rrrake your face if you say otherwise!
13040 : Let's just reach in the bag and see what it is...
13041 : Yes, isn't this just amazing?
13042 : You've prrroven far more useful than I imagined. If you bring me # more treasures I'm sure I can find something else to give you. Just be quicker on the uptake next time!
13043 : Menace Hunt debug menu. Leave menu. Change progress.
13044 : Change progress? Return to start. Prerequisites not met. Prerequisites met. Never been to fractures. Been to fractures. Cleared fracture one. Cleared fracture two. Cleared fracture three.
13045 : Progress set to [Prerequisites not met./Prerequisites met./Never been to fractures./Been to fracture./Cleared fracture one./Cleared fracture two./Cleared fracture three.]
13046 : S-suffering succotash! That's %, isn't it!? I can hardly believe you had it in you to rrrout that fiend.
13047 : Huh!? As if I'd ever watch you flounder your way through a battle. I'll tear out your thrrroat if you suggest anything like that again! I only figured because your % looked really powerful.
13048 : A commendable job--for the rrrunt of the litter. Don't forget the other fractures out there, either.
13049 : What a rrresplendent %... I could stare at it for hours on end.
13050 : The longer you look, the more it mesmerrrizes you, doesn't it? I can almost feel its power coming out, grabbing me by the scrrruff, and carrying me to a happier place.
13051 : Enough with my fantasies, go stalk some prrrey for your third treasure!
13052 : <Purrr><purrr> Yes, %... Another stunning example of the beauty that lies within these frrractures. Who would've thunk you'd get this far?
13053 : What? Of course I'm being condescending. I like my purrrsonal interactions like my fish--ice cold.
13054 : Still, I'll give crrredit where credit's due...to me for choosing you.
13055 : But I jest...or do I? Now that you've amassed all three known treasures, I've an announcement. To reward you for your valiant endeavors, I'd like to offer you a rrrandom trinket from some extras I found in a ditch!
13056 : Hm? No, no, no, I said so extraordinary they'll help in a pinch! Yes, that's it. Yeesh, I didn't know you were such a negative Nylene.
13057 : Oh, if you've still got some sprrring in your step, why not try exploring all the different veiled territories and collecting the riches within?
13058 : If you're able to lick them all good, then I might just give you a prrresent...if I feel like it.
13059 : Well, well, well, what purrrfect timing for an adventurer--uh, pioneer maybe--to show up!
13060 : We've just rrrecently discovered some new excavation sites! What're we calling them? Why, the hyper-intuitive obscured domains, of course!
13061 : Sounds like a rrrousing good time, doesn't it? I knew you'd agree! Time to go pawing around for yggrete, then. Bye bye!
13062 : Receive which rewards? None. Celadon, zaffre, and alizarin-related ones. Russet, phlox, and aster-related ones. Ones for conquering # fractures.
13063 : What are obscured domains? How stupid do you have to be? They're arrreas that are obscured.
13064 : They were crrreat--er, they exist adjacent to Marjami Ravine, Yorcia Weald, and Kamihr Drifts.
13065 : Past their veils, groves upon groves of trees and shrubs and what have you grrrow there, so it's easy to get lost like a rat in a maze.
13066 : Huh? M-me? No, I've never been to one! I'm only...rrrepeating what I heard. Right.
13067 : As for the entrrrances, though, they're the same as the ones you use for fractures. Surprise!
13068 : I think they're called mirages or vellum or something. I let my subordinates deal with the mundane particulars.
13069 : A Tarutaru named Chalvava in the Civic Arboretum asked you to deliver this % to the castle?
13070 : Sorry, but I'm still reluctant to let you in just because you know the name of the vegetable vendor we contracted...
13071 : What's this I hear about Chalvava?
13072 : Why, hello there, %.
13073 : First, I'd like to apologize for not saying goodbye before leaving the coliseum. I...got lost in thought.
13074 : Wait, those are...Adoulinian tomatoes!
13075 : So...Chalvava did remember our promise...
13076 : I'm so happy... You came all the way here just to bring these to us? Well then, would you mind carrying them to the kitchen for me?
13077 : Princess, if I may...
13078 : You have nothing to worry about. % is one of the most trustworthy people I know.
13079 : It seems we're destined to meet in the most unconventional of circumstances...
13080 : H-how's my brother feeling? He...well, he's not in danger of dying.
13081 : You want to see him? I don't know...
13082 : He's not really in any condition to hold an audience with anyone.
13083 : I really appreciate the tomatoes, though. They sure do look delic--
13084 : That...that's not really why you're here? Then what are you here for?
13085 : You hand Arciela the %.
13086 : What!? They said they're going to remove my brother from his seat for all eternity!?
13087 : That... No, they wouldn't... They couldn't...
13088 : Did you hear that? I thought I heard a scream.
13089 : Who are these...
13090 : They appeared as if from the shadows, my lady!
13091 : Tsk. And here I thought no one in Vana'diel could disenchant our stealth incantations...
13092 : No matter, though. Now that we've made it this far...
13093 : You're not going to lay a finger on my brother!
13094 : Heh... He doesn't even raise his voice in protest, let alone try to flee.
13095 : It doesn't look as if a mere night's rest will cure what he has. Isn't that right, Princess?
13096 : I...um...
13097 : Our work here is done.
13098 : After them!
13099 : You retrieve a verdant clump of moss-covered dirt from the floor.
13100 : This moss...I've only ever seen it grow in cool, sunless places. Could one of the assassins have tracked it in with them?
13101 : If that's the case, then their bodies and what gets stuck to their shoes don't actually vanish. We just can't see them.
13102 : That means that they probably came from somewhere that never gets touched by either heat or light.
13103 : But where could that be...?
13104 : Add your two gil? Mention what transpired in the waterways.
13105 : You never cease to amaze me, %. Is there anything I want to know that you don't already?
13106 : Wait, there's no time for idle banter! We should hurry if we want to catch them.
13107 : What? No one's there anymore? Even so, we don't have any other leads...
13108 : Let's go there anyway and see if we can find some other clues.
13109 : Where from? The beginning. Inside the castle. The standoff.
13110 : The chancellor is so stricken with illness that he can't rise from his bed!
13111 : If he can't even attend assembly meetings, how is he supposed to lead the colonization movement?
13112 : Would you care to expound upon these rumors, Arciela?
13113 : If your brother has truly taken ill, let me have a look at him. I shall do everything in my power to see that he recovers.
13114 : Mistress Svenja...
13115 : This validates my argument all the more. We cannot have an invalid running our nation. Even when he made his presence felt daily, the nation was practically in shambles!
13116 : I call for his immediate abdication. Let Arciela assume his position and we can all--
13117 : Just a goddessdamn minutaru! Why raise Arciela to Ygnas's position!?
13118 : Because it seems like the most glaringly obvious course of action.
13119 : This is a governmentaru by the people, for the people! We didn't create this alliance so some living skeleton-weleton could bully us into doing what he wants!
13120 : Besides, the chancellor-wancellor will be better in no time. Right?
13121 : !?
13122 : What in the wind-whipped woodlands was that eerie-weerie sound!?
13123 : Don't try to tell me none of you heard it, either. Master merchantaru Chero-Machero can hear a single grain of bayld drop from yalms away.
13124 : No... Now he can't even speak...?
13125 : <Gulp>
13126 : A mannequin-wannequin!?
13127 : Or is it a...leafkin? No, a doll...?
13128 : Y-Ygnas...?
13129 : ...!?
13130 : You're not telling us that this verdantaru mass of twigs is...
13131 : Grand Chancellor Ygnas!? But...he resembles a leafkin in every possible way.
13132 : It's the curse!
13133 : It's retribution for failing to heed the words of the founder king!
13134 : What a ghastly fate!
13135 : Ygnas...
13136 : Wh...when did this all start?
13137 : Right after he began recruiting adventurers from the Middle Lands.
13138 : He began complaining of constant fatigue, and would sleep practically the whole day away.
13139 : I was still able to exchange words with him the last time we met, however... I had no idea that...
13140 : To think the curse actually exists...
13141 : Its existence is much more plausible than many are likely to think.
13142 : There is an account of a haunting that dates back to the Great Expedition, a time when the founder king's influence had just begun to wane.
13143 : The ruler at the time claimed that the founder king's ghost appeared in his bedchamber, warning that any attempt to enter the forest would bring with it grave consequences.
13144 : Soon after that ominous apparition's visit, myriad disasters erupted throughout the capital.
13145 : The coincidence was too horrifying to ignore. The people immediately called a halt to colonization, erected a new tomb for the first king beneath the city, and held a prolonged vigil to appease him.
13146 : As a result, the ghost stopped appearing and the disasters abated. Some will likely claim that this is nothing but an old wives' tale, but I assure you it is not. This story can be corroborated by any number of scholarly chronicles.
13147 : If it is indeed a curse, then perhaps we can lift it like any other?
13148 : Has anyone tried casting Cursna upon him?
13149 : Cast Cursna? I'll give it the old adventurer's try. Psh, it's bound to fail.
13150 : % casts Cursna.
13151 : It has absolutely no effect on Ygnas!
13152 : If no one else has, please allow me to try.
13153 : Svenja casts Cursna.
13154 : Unbelievable... This has got to be the single strongest curse I have ever encountered.
13155 : I knew we should never have set foot in the hinterland!
13156 : To neglect the founder king's wisdom is to seal our own doom!
13157 : We have disfigured the forest. It is only natural that it seeks rrrevenge.
13158 : Are you saying that it's empirically impossible for us to coexist with the jungle?
13159 : That the only thing we can do is mutilate each other beyond recognition?
13160 : Your % begins to glow a light green.
13161 : (Can you hear me, %?)
13162 : A ghostly echo reverberates inside your head.
13163 : (My name is Ygnas S. Adoulin.)
13164 : (I am brother to Arciela, who stands next to you.)
13165 : %...?
13166 : (There is no time for beating around the bush--so to speak--so let me say this right now.)
13167 : (%...)
13168 : (Do not, under any circumstances, cease colonization.)
13169 : What's going on, %?
13170 : What? A strange voice? No, I don't hear anything like that at all...
13171 : (Furthermore, much more important issues lie before us than the lifting of this curse.)
13172 : The voice is Ygnas's!?
13173 : ......
13174 : You remember what Rosulatia told us, don't you?
13175 : Do you? Yes. No.
13176 : What were they? Aaask...the king... Aaask...the queen...
13177 : Yes, that's it! You didn't have to add the funny accent, though.
13178 : She said, Ask the king, so...
13179 : What if the king she was referring to isn't their ruler...
13180 : But my brother, who's been transformed into a leafkin?
13181 : Arciela...I am completely lost. What in the heavens have you been talking about?
13182 : % says [he/she] can communicate with Ygnas.
13183 : So, %, what's my brother saying?
13184 : (Trouble yourself not with breaking the curse.)
13185 : (Instead, adventurer, listen to what I have learned...as long as you can hear me.)
13186 : (I have transmogrified into a piece of Yggdrasil, the World Tree.)
13187 : (%, Yggdrasil's powers are dwindling even as we speak...)
13188 : (A disturbance has appeared in the heart of Ulbuka. Darkness gushes forth as if from some forbidden spring.)
13189 : (It is that very darkness which drains Yggdrasil's strength...)
13190 : (And you will be the one to stop the cause of it, %.)
13191 : (If you do not, and this harrowing force chokes Yggdrasil with its crepuscular grip...)
13192 : (All life in Ulbuka will cease to exist as we know it. Of this I am certain.)
13193 : %, your face... It's so pale.
13194 : What did my brother tell you!?
13195 : %! Speak to me, %!
13196 : You truly believe I will fall for this ruse? That seed will allow us to communicate with Ygnas as much as holding a tea party for the Blackthorn Coven will assuage their undying rancor.
13197 : It is only natural that some of us will harbor doubts about what [he/she] says. The only way to prove [him/her] right or wrong is to test it for ourselves.
13198 : %, was it? Do you mind if we borrow that mystic plant of yours for a bit?
13199 : We've been tricked! You can't hear Ygnas's voice at all!
13200 : I do find it odd that none of us were able to hear him.
13201 : However, I also do not see any reason for [him/her] to lie to us.
13202 : Since when did a pioneer need a reas--
13203 : %, let me try.
13204 : Arciela...
13205 : ...I can hear something.
13206 : It's...definitely the voice of my brother.
13207 : How hilar...I mean intriguing.
13208 : Yes... I see. ...But why, brother?
13209 : Arciela, what's your tinder-legged brother-wother saying?
13210 : The same thing as he told %. Trouble yourself not with breaking the curse.
13211 : Hmmm.
13212 : Why is it only these two can communicate with him?
13213 : How utterly in-in-incomprehensible. This administration can't f-f-function properly...without a leader.
13214 : I agree wholeheartedly with you, Vortimere.
13215 : We must p-p-prioritize...removing the chancellor's curse. That is what's best...for the nation.
13216 : But...my brother explicitly told us not to!
13217 : L-l-listen, Arciela. You and that pioneer are the only two who...claim they can hear him.
13218 : We can't overlook the possibility that...you two might be c-c-conspiring together.
13219 : That's preposterous!
13220 : I realize that it's unlikely...and maybe I should have ch-ch-chosen my words more carefully.
13221 : However, I assume that most everyone here...c-c-concurs with me. Returning Ygnas to his original f-f-form is...our first concern.
13222 : I'm sure even you agree...to some extent.
13223 : I find it d-d-difficult to believe that...you take issue with...him being human. You don't wish for him to stay a...pile of twigs for the rest of his l-l-life, do you?
13224 : Well, no. But...
13225 : That is all I need to hear. I know exactly the person...to s-s-solve this problem. All we need to do...is summon her b-b-back from her expedition.
13226 : Expedition? Ahhh, the mercil... I really should do something about that loose tongue of mine. At any rate, this should prove to be an interesting turn of events.
13227 : This meeting is adjourned. Let us...convene again in a f-f-few days' time.
13228 : I take it you are yearning to fly like a proverbial bird, to swoop through the alleyways of Adoulin screeching about your strength and speed?
13229 : Hmmm... If my memory serves me, I believe there is a wizened wise man in Jeuno who is well-versed in the ululations steel can conjure.
13230 : Perhaps it would behoove you to hoof it on over to the Duchy and pay a visit to him?
13231 : Your reputation precedes you. I can tell simply from the aura that swirls violently around your frame that you have achieved quite the degree of success as a rune fencer. It is only a matter of time before Maat takes notice of your finely refined skills.
13232 : You need only take one step into the city to have me sense the immense aura you exude, pioneer. Should you remain diligent and devoted, you will surely be able to succeed in succeeding the Order of Orvail as an acclaimed rune fencer...once you pass the examination.
13233 : Interesting, indeed. My eye proves as accurate as a panopt's once again.
13234 : Let me apologize for wasting your time with my esoteric ramblings.
13235 : I was simply lost in reverie about the first time I bore witness to your talents.
13236 : I assume you remember that fateful day as if it had transpired but moments ago. The experience of you engraving a rune upon your flesh after try number # certainly lingers unspoiled in my mind.
13237 : Never has one so naturally suited to the runic arts appeared before me. You are perhaps the very incarnation of runic energies...or the second coming of Sverdhried himself.
13238 : I sensed an uncanny reserve of untapped power bubbling over when I first set eyes upon you, and now I believe you could very well surpass the majority of Orvail's fencers in affinity for the arts.
13239 : When faced with adversity, you heeded my call across a ravine of despair, drew upon your inner runic powers, and faltered not. It is little wonder that you have come so far in such a brief period.
13240 : That which does not kill you can only make you stronger. The inner battle you fought served to strengthen your resolve, and though it may have been late in the season, your runic skills have blossomed no less vividly than even mine.
13241 : Ah, yes. It takes mountains of perseverance to join the century club, since those who do often lack even the smallest iota of talent. I still believed in you, however, and am now rewarded with your presence before me today.
13242 : But enough with the social graces and circumlocutions. Allow me to point you in the direction of this conversation's point.
13243 : Are you ready to throw caution to the wind, unshackle yourself from the fetters of mediocrity, and soar to higher heights as a rune fencer?
13244 : Soar higher? As high as the sun! I'll keep my feet on the ground. What...? How?
13245 : The Order of Orvail institutes a test of seasoned rune fencers' skills that has remained essentially unchanged for generation upon generation.
13246 : Passing it is commonly seen as a rite of passage to becoming fully fledged in the runic arts.
13247 : So, I shall ask again. What say you to taking the next step and ascending a step closer to the summit of rune fencerdom?
13248 : Many in my situation would throw their hands up in disappointment at your unwillingness to take flight. I, however, have confidence you will change your mind one day. Until then, dear %.
13249 : Is now the time when you will step up to the challenge, spread your wings, and take flight?
13250 : That is exactly the answer I wanted to hear. It evinces your dauntless nature--a natural trait in rune fencers. Even had you answered in the negative previously, the filth of indecision is washed clean with the three simple letters Y-E-S.
13251 : Ahem. As a symbol of your lofty intent to undertake the Trial of Reason, let us engrave another rune upon your skin!
13252 : Now that your soul burns with passion and your flesh burns with the insignia placed upon it, pass through the gates of % and run the gauntlet of your greatest weaknesses.
13253 : Your adversary will be one of the order's finest. Trade blows with them and see if you can blow past them to the next echelon of proficiency in the runic arts.
13254 : It will be your knowledge of proclivities and propensities, aversions and antitheses that shall ensure your victory. Use it wisely.
13255 : I repeat: it would be...unbecoming of a rune fencer if you were to forget the lessons you have learned up until now.
13256 : You went down in defeat, I see... None the matter, as long as you turn this stumbling block into a stepping stone.
13257 : As much as I would like to imbue the challenger's rune upon you again, I currently lack the resources to create another.
13258 : Doing so requires a special medium, which will take some time to procure.
13259 : If you simply cannot wait a moment longer, however, you can always expedite the process by providing either # gil, # bayld, or # %.
13260 : What will you provide? # gil. (# on hand) # bayld. (# on hand) # %. Nothing. I'll wait.
13261 : Truly donate # gil? Yes. No.
13262 : Truly donate # bayld? Yes. No.
13263 : Well, patience is a virtue, they say. If you have no need to hurry, come by in a few days' time and you may very well find my preparations to be finished.
13264 : A bold decision, indeed. For # ), I shall be able to engrave another rune upon you.
13265 : Thank you for your generous donation of # %. Is currency not a wonderful invention? An abstract yet concrete metaphor for an exchange of services.
13266 : Thank you for your kind donation. With this, I shall be able to defer the costs of the engraving ritual.
13267 : True rune fencers are honest and adhere to a code of chivalry, but you...you disappoint me, trying to extract services from someone without conferring the appropriate funds in return.
13268 : And so you have returned, no doubt from adventures extraordinary. Taking into account that my preparations are complete, I deduce that your friendly gesture may have an ulterior motive...
13269 : Wish you to prove your worth against that maiden once more?
13270 : Oh, my. Could it be that you wish to clash swords with Miss Braga once more?
13271 : Clash swords once more? Yes. No.
13272 : My sincerest apologies, %.
13273 : Then let us begin the engraving ceremony once more.
13274 : The ink is embedded and your will steeled. Now all that is left is to tread into the Coliseum so that you may walk over the back of your opponent.
13275 : My face lit up with a joy that rivals Altana's maternal glow when news of your victory first alighted upon my ears, %! Congratulations.
13276 : It sounded like a simply thrilling bout!
13277 : I must remind you, however, that the end of your battle with Braga marks only the beginning of your journey with this newfound puissance.
13278 : Cast your diligence as a rune fencer into the fray, and I suspect you will be busy for quite some time.
13279 : Furthermore, keep in mind that you have earned the favor of Sverdhried's progeny and been deemed worthy of climbing higher upon the craggy precipice towards runic mastery.
13280 : Turn not your back upon the opportunities you have been given, lest the tables turn and you find yourself forsaken and wandering aimlessly.
13281 : Respect the runes, though, and you shall never walk alone.
13282 : Utterly astonishing... I am positively atingle with excitement at % for having etched the % upon [himself/herself].
13283 : Still, that battle... History is bound to repeat itself...or should I say re-dye itself a different shade?
13284 : Oh ho, you were here all along. How are your runes doing? Are they singing the songs you thought they would, or spelling the writing on the wall?
13285 : Ah, your arrival is indeed opportune. There is a certain problem which has consumed so much of my time, it has practically given me a bout of consumption.
13286 : Our order wishes to forge a blade of legendary status to display at the upcoming celebration of Orvail's grandeur. It must be strong enough to forge dynasties and durable enough to outlast them. Nothing less will bring honor to our glorious rune-bound brotherhood.
13287 : To my most earnest regret, however, my hands are most full with new recruits. Loath am I to neglect our order's future for the sake of its present. Therefore, would you be so kind as to assist in crafting this symbol of Orvail's mastery over the runes?
13288 : Help craft the blade? Yes, I'd love to! No, this is beneath me.
13289 : It saddens me to hear those words from someone so accomplished as you, %. I cannot enforce my will upon you, however. Pay me a visit should your stance on the matter shift.
13290 : Has the tide of cooperation risen high with prospect and brought you to the shores of our cause, or does it still recede into the depths of yonder endeavors?
13291 : Your aid is much appreciated. Firstly, we need to employ the steady and sturdy hand of a veteran blacksmith. One whose spirit burns as fierce as the flames of his forge.
13292 : I will let him know of your visit at some point. Now, excuse me while I attend to refining the skills of those with rawer talents than yours.
13293 : I require that you seek out an accomplished smith who can fold steel with as little effort as an innkeep folds fresh linens.
13294 : I see... Our order is a tall one, indeed. Taller at least than the blacksmith with whom you negotiated.
13295 : Still, to refuse one who is engraved with the %... What a character, that Yestin-Ovestin.
13296 : Ah, but what of Jerra?
13297 : That Tarutaru's temper may glow hotter than the swords he tempers, but his disciple, Jerra, is much more receptive to...well, anyone and everything.
13298 : You should be able to unearth her in the Civic Arboretum inside the %. Simply sniff for a Mithra drenched in the scent of tomatoes.
13299 : Though his disposition is often said to be suspect, none can doubt Yestin-Ovestin's skill with the hammer and anvil. That blade should be as sharp as my wit in no time at all.
13300 : Oh, how I have eagerly awaited your arrival, %. I received this most momentous of swords but not a moment ago.
13301 : Speaking of which, 'tis high time I tore down the fence of secrecy surrounding rune fencer blades.
13302 : Sverdhried, the grandfather of the runic arts, was gracious enough to grace Adoulinian smiths with the method by which he fashioned his personal sword.
13303 : Not simply the blade itself, mind you, but instructions on how to create it. Know you not what this implies?
13304 : The runes we employ are inscribed both upon and within ourselves. Such is why they resonate with our very emotions and cogitations.
13305 : The same can be said of a runeist's relationship with his blade. The deeper the emotional bond between the two, the faster his runes will adjust to the sword's presence and the stronger they will resonate with each other.
13306 : You have wandered far and wide to obtain everything necessary to create this metallic magnum opus, and even forged your own friendship with a forge stoker.
13307 : Your experiences, the passion of its creator, and the emotional ties between you were all molded into the resilient and acuate shape you see before you.
13308 : Therefore, while this was crafted for the sake of Orvail and rune fencers everywhere, there is no one more fitting in Vana'diel to wield this blade than you, %.
13309 : And the name of your new companion--the symbol of all you have sacrificed for this order--is...the %.
13310 : Take command of this shining example of defensive excellence and offensive might. The sky is truly the limit once you master the intricacies of this blade.
13311 : Whatever will I do for the ceremony? No need to brood upon such banalities, [son/daughter] of the runeist flock.
13312 : I entreated my personal smith to fashion one for me while you were engrossed in your duties.
13313 : Your destination as a fencer was predestined long before you trod upon this continent. Focus on reaching it, and let me handle the particulars.
13314 : %! A rival of yours has arrived saying he desires to combat you.
13315 : Ohohoho, did my jape give you a start? The true reason I am happy to see you is that rumors abound regarding some cryptic apparatuses scattered throughout the Middle Lands that harbor runic powers.
13316 : I remain highly skeptical of these tales, but they do pique my interest as a rune fencer.
13317 : Therefore, I would greatly appreciate your cooperation in investigating these contrivances. What say you, [good sir/fair lady]?
13318 : What say you? Middle Lands, ho! You can survey me walking away. Cryptic apparatuses?
13319 : A response more frigid than a Gelus rune, but not entirely unwarranted. I shall wait for your heart to warm to my request rather than fanning the fire with a witty retort.
13320 : There is scarcely a thing known about them, which stands to reason if they are cryptic, but I shall divulge what I can.
13321 : They are said to be hidden within the walls of certain caverns and structures in the Middle Lands.
13322 : These devices remain shrouded in mysteries thicker than the veil of any bereaved widow. Surveying them may separate you from your loved ones eternally, but rest assured that your death would be for the good of the runic arts.
13323 : So, will you cave in and survey caverns, ruins, and other structures all over the Middle Lands in search of those cryptic contraptions?
13324 : How I have waited upon bended knee for those words.
13325 : The winds of adventure shall carry you across the Sarutabaruta steppes to the Federation of Windurst. Once there, pay a visit to Ohruru.
13326 : Her idiosyncratic speech patterns belie the fact that her knowledge is as vast as the skies and her intellect as bright as the sun on a sweltering summer day. Though she may seem a tad peculiar, she is more than worthy of your trust.
13327 : Show that woman of letters this letter and you will be on your way to inscribing your own tales.
13328 : I just received a correspondence from Ohruru debriefing me on your investigation. Congratulations!
13329 : As thanks for your generosity and high-mindedness in undertaking this mission for us, I have commissioned Yestin-Ovestin to craft some high-class armor for you!
13330 : I specifically told him to forge something that would draw out the powers of any runes you had inscribed upon yourself, so its efficacy is assured.
13331 : I believe he is almost finished hammering out the particulars. Perhaps you should call upon him as soon as you have the time.
13332 : ...Oh? What is this I spy? A rune stone?
13333 : What!? Sverdhried's voice can be heard from within those cryptic contraptions?
13334 : ...Interesting, indeed. This undoubtedly warrants further investigation.
13335 : On behalf of the Order of Orvail, I request permission for us to conduct our own surveys. Do you assent?
13336 : What an intriguing specimen you have there. It differs slightly from the rune stones I possess.
13337 : It contains nonsensical vocal transcriptions, you say?
13338 : ...Hmmm, it seems we of Orvail need to be more vocal about this matter. Allow me to take any you have in the name of research.
13339 : Now that you have imparted # stone[/s] to us, we must now part ways.
13340 : ...But not before I reward you.
13341 : By Altana almighty! So that is the form that rune stones take when forged into equipment!
13342 : Would you be willing to part with it to further the cause of rune fencers everywhere?
13343 : Part with the equipment? Yes. No.
13344 : My apologies, %. I was unaware that you simply wanted to flaunt in front of another rune fencer.
13345 : Thank you! <Sniff> I hope my tears of gratitude have an outlet to the Senroh Sea lest they cause a flood. Oh, and do not hesitate to provide more equipment if you have any.
13346 : The next time you get your hands on some, please hand them over to me!
13347 : That % looks positively splendid on you, %. May it serve you well in battle.
13348 : Your path has been long and hard, just as I warned you so long ago that it would be. Yet, look how far you have come in spite of it all.
13349 : Now that you have soared to the heights I predicted you would, it is time for you to embark on your final test.
13350 : ...Or it would be if there was not a certain setback set before us.
13351 : We have not held the ultimate trial for rune fencers ever since that fateful accident two years ago.
13352 : As you can imagine, I have a favor to ask of you regarding this.
13353 : I am fully aware of my impertinence, but this requires skill that only someone of your caliber and experience possesses.
13354 : Would you please get to the bottom of why the trial went bottom-up?
13355 : Take on the task? It would be my pleasure. No, do your own work.
13356 : Your reply is a caustic verbal venom I completely expected, yet I have no retort for it. I cannot argue with infallible logic, so will instead fall back on apology. Please forgive my brashness.
13357 : At the risk of seeming incompetent, I ask you to kindly reconsider your decision on looking into the final trial.
13358 : Thank you ever so much. I hope that, one of these days, I can salvage what little remains of your shipwrecked image of me.
13359 : Before you begin your fact-finding mission, however, I must impart upon you this object of apodictic import.
13360 : It is %, a picturesque device that can both record pictures on and project them from rune stones.
13361 : This is the same type of contraption a researcher from the Inventors' Coalition used to record the events of that trial two years prior.
13362 : By all accounts, it was still accounted for somewhere in the Inventors' Coalition. I need you to review their footage and judge whether or not the current trial is appropriate for rune fencers to undertake.
13363 : Speak to Gaddiux, who has been instructed to divulge all the necessary information.
13364 : Simply inquire about %. He will understand what you mean.
13365 : Oh, %. Have the winds of understanding blown you here with a gust of new information?
13366 : I see... It certainly looks as if the visual record contained in that rock has rocked your image of the trial.
13367 : Would you mind apprising me of your discovery?
13368 : What did you discover? Someone went missing. There's a monster in %.
13369 : It is as you say. A researcher did indeed go missing after the incident.
13370 : Her name was Mikolulu...and she was accompanying her younger brother on the ultimate trial.
13371 : The only clues to her whereabouts we could obtain were the severed tip of her broadsword and patches of chainmail.
13372 : I fear that she... <Gulp> Even now, those words are too painful to speak aloud.
13373 : Not even the most clandestine of facts escapes you.
13374 : Though I have never forayed into %, I could never forget about the abomination that fouls the waters there.
13375 : Many of the surveyors who ventured into the Ulbukan jungle were devoured by it. The beast gained such an abhorrent reputation that soon it became known as Insidio.
13376 : The city assembled a band of its finest warriors to dispatch Insidio, and they returned seemingly victorious. However, it quickly returned as if nothing had ever transpired. Perhaps it only left to spawn or somesuch and our extermination plan never truly succeeded at all.
13377 : It is not a far-fetched assumption to make, considering the cunning Insidio displays in battle. Its most fearsome trick is to turn opponents' allies into enemies by manipulating their minds.
13378 : While I would rather avoid entangling you in this affair, my hands are tied at the moment and I am left with no other recourse.
13379 : Would you please make for % and rid it of Insidio? Do this for the good of the city, for the colonization initiative...
13380 : And for me. I have lost scores of friends and fellow countrymen to that fish's lure and wish to see someone finally reel in that atrocity once and for all.
13381 : Oh...oh my! That is...%, is it not!?
13382 : The finite nature of our language definitely does not allow me to adequately express the extent of my gratitude, but I hope the following will suffice.
13383 : On behalf of Insidio's victims and all those who have suffered in its wake, thank you.
13384 : You have proved a tremendous help in regards to the ultimate trial as well.
13385 : Is there anything you would like to say about it?
13386 : What about the ultimate trial? The area's too dangerous. It needs more hints. Make clear what the rewards are. Prioritize safety. It lacks impact. Where's the love? It's completely useless. I have nothing to say.
13387 : As a member of the Order of Orvail, it would pain me to see your advice come to no avail, but I do not foresee the trial going away anytime soon. Your opinion, however, is much appreciated.
13388 : Your words give me wings. Thank you for the vote of confidence. ...Or is this a case of If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all?
13389 : Hmmm...your criticism certainly has merit. I promise to take it into consideration when revising this most critical of trials.
13390 : Now that you have metaphorically scratched my back, it is time that I scratched yours.
13391 : Here it is, %...given to rune fencers who have gone above and beyond the call of duty.
13392 : This particular piece of equipment was woven by the most polished artisan known to Ulbuka, so wear it with pride.
13393 : I wonder how that Tarutaru's face would look if he had completed the trial two years ago and I was able to give him this as I just have to you...
13394 : To you, who have transcended the ranks of common rune fencers and amassed vaults of memories along the way, may your smile always beam with the power of the runes and your blade cut the air with the precision of the most proficient calligrapher.
13395 : I was remiss to mention that we know not how to replenish the energies that power % once they are depleted.

13435 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
13436 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
13437 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.

13528 : As an exorcist of the highest caliber, recognizing those whose talents may be of use comes as second nature.

13553 : Despite your greatest efforts to derail this ritual, it appears to have been a success. My alter ego shall surely be of great use to you.
13554 : With Adoulin's most prominent exorcist at your side, your foes will tremble and flee!
13555 : Yes... This incantation only strengthens my ability to purge the world of its ills. Let it take wing and guide you...
13556 : Only once the world is clean will I finally be free of this pain.
13557 : Mommy, I...
13558 : I must request that you inquire another time, as the order is inundated with various issues these past few moons.
13559 : Things keep turning from bad to worse.
13560 : And look who's come to sprinkle rock salt in my wounds. <Sigh> As long as you insist on bringing thunderclouds into my life, I might as well ask--you're familiar with Hildebert, yes?
13561 : Do you remember Hildebert? Hildewho? Oh, yeah, the old guy. Say nothing.
13562 : The head of the Order of Weatherspoon, always wearing those same tired white vestments.
13563 : Ugh. I'm eminently aware that not all of us have a way with names, but if you're going to barge into the castle and stick your fingers in everyone's pies, you should at least have the decency to answer a simple question!
13564 : Well, now you've discovered a character flaw to work on. One of many, I presume.
13565 : [Then perhaps/I would perhaps be wrong to presume that] you are aware that his wife fell ill due to some strange demon called Balamor's machinations?
13566 : Were you aware of this fact? O-of course! Nope.
13567 : Oho. Then I'm sure you can also tell me what her name is.
13568 : Naturally. Even the most loose-lipped among our order knows better than to start spreading that around.
13569 : Far be it from me to sympathize with Hildebert--or anyone, really--when he's fighting with our beloved princess, but even I must confess to harboring a bit of pity for his son, Marcellurin.
13570 : The blood of generations of exorcists courses through her veins, and she is more susceptible than most to the whims and whimsies of spirits.
13571 : She did return to us for a brief while when you purged Hades from the land...
13572 : ...But the slumber has taken hold of her once more. The sun has thrice risen since her eyes opened last. Even I must confess concern, not only for her, but for her son, Marcellurin.
13573 : Ingrid, you need not miss any sleep over my mental state.
13574 : My duty is to support both my father and the Order of Weatherspoon during times of crisis.
13575 : Altana knows that no love has been lost between you and my father over these past few months.
13576 : And despite the past, you have spent countless nights working with Arciela for the betterment of us all.
13577 : Ah, the ramblings of a madman never cease, do they?
13578 : Yet do not think me wholly without heart. I take full responsibility for the chaos within the order.
13579 : I had hoped to seek his counsel...but my tongue always gets the better of me.
13580 : The curse has taken its toll on many, but my mother has been hit particularly hard. I fear her spirit and body have suffered in equal measure.
13581 : We did exactly as Arciela wanted, and look where that has gotten us.
13582 : My father [continues to make/had previously made] that assertion, so any struggle of words between you was inevitable.
13583 : His stubbornness is beyond parallel, especially when presented with evidence to the contrary.
13584 : And you? Your blithe naivete is rather incomparable as well.
13585 : And you, your invective language.
13586 : Marcellurin and I grew up together.
13587 : Nothing in life is ever easy--least of all our relationship. My mother failed a purgation ritual, losing all that she held dear...and thus Hildebert took me in.
13588 : But the distance between us has always been great. Only Marcellurin treated me as true family.
13589 : He remained by my side through thick and thin, especially when the tragedy of my mother's passing grew too much to bear.
13590 : What would that say about me were I to stand idle while a similar fate threatens to ravage him?
13591 : But the blind fool fails to recognize that the possibility is staring him down.
13592 : Should the worst strike him unawares, I fear it would crush him beyond repair.
13593 : If anyone can predict his reaction, it is me. The boy is blissfully half-witted.
13594 : Come, now. Would someone sensitive be able to withstand my acid tongue for this many years?
13595 : Choose your response carefully. ...I suppose not. ...Oh, I wouldn't say that...
13596 : Bah!
13597 : What am I thinking, gushing with emotion to the likes of you?
13598 : The only one in this city who pays you a lick of attention is Arciela.
13599 : But you are not the only one who supports her. I, too, must do my part to unite the city under her banner.
13600 : I am due for a meeting with Gratzigg at the Peacekeepers' Coalition before sundown.
13601 : Though the rift between Arciela and the orders has been mended, I must advise those who doubted her in the best way to comport themselves going forward.
13602 : Gratzigg is but the first of many, and he has bid me visit his manse.
13603 : I would be surprisingly unopposed to you joining me there, should you feel it would serve the princess's best interest.
13604 : Ingrid has stepped out for a brief meeting with Gratzigg at his manse. Perhaps it would behoove you to seek the two of them.
13605 : Lookin' for Ingrid?
13606 : She passed by here, sure, but the maester's busy and shooed her away. 'Fraid he'd do the same to you.
13607 : Round up everyone you can! I don't care if they're on leave--we need every hand we can get to root out that jungle menace!
13608 : I see you've chosen to tag along.
13609 : I had hoped to have a fruitful discussion with our esteemed friend, but with the way he's ranting and raving I would have better luck playing catch-the-heartwing blindfolded.
13610 : <Sigh> I should have expected no less. The disturbances in the jungle keep going from bad to worse, and even I can't bring myself to call down Altana's wrath upon him.
13611 : I demand everyone double down on their patrols--and if I see even one crack in Jorius Yett, it'll be your hides!
13612 : The maester is even more relentless than usual these days...
13613 : I'll say.
13614 : You there! Get out there before I strip you of your uniforms and make you run stark naked across Big Bridge!
13615 : At least the pig isn't running around blaming Arciela for all this.
13616 : Brush up those uniforms, men!
13617 : None of what befell the city would've happened if the Peackeepers hadn't failed to uphold our charge!
13618 : At least the pig can issue calls to action.
13619 : Ingrid, you insufferable-- I told you that I don't have time for any of your nonsense until I get things cleared up around here!
13620 : Get your keister outta here before I kick it to the streets myself!
13621 : ...But some things never change.
13622 : What a worthless mongrel. How can he keep the peace if he cannot even keep his own troops in order?
13623 : <Sigh> This incident Gratizgg spoke of...I have no choice but to clean it up in his stead.
13624 : Someone suspicious traipsing about Yorcia Weald, southwest of the frontier station? Could you picture anything more laughably absurd?
13625 : If the perpetrator is not a pioneer, then it stands to reason...
13626 : ...that it could be the dread fiend Balamor. Presuming he has not decided to possess Fremilla again.
13627 : Those two-bit goons Gratzigg decided to dress up in armor would stand no chance against one of that caliber. Once again, it falls to me to clean up others' messes.
13628 : ...that it could be the dread fiend Balamor. Presuming he has not decided to possess Fremilla again.
13629 : But with Hades gone, what purpose would masquerading around in human form serve?
13630 : Hmph. I shall make him spit it out when I grab him.
13631 : Perhaps you would like to see this all play out, given your previous run-ins with him. But no, more likely than not you have your hands full bleeding the city's bayld coffers dry. Forget I said anything.
13632 : A suspicious individual has been sighted to the southwest of the frontier station in Yorcia Weald.
13633 : There's an ergon locus nearby, so perhaps it's someone trying to harvest its power? That's pure speculation, of course, but the populace is bound to fathom the worst when there is little information.
13634 : Gratzigg and Ingrid are likely mincing words at the Peacekeepers' Coalition--and the high exorcist is likely in one of her moods.
13635 : Ingrid! Did you parley with the enemy to get this...thing!?
13636 : That Morimar guy who came to the castle gave this to you? What use could any of us have for a sullied piece of cloth?
13637 : Open your eyes, fool. Even you can understand what this means.
13638 : ...Impossible!
13639 : By all that is holy, this seal--it's Jorius's!
13640 : Maybe there is some semblance of a brain inside that rock head of yours. Jorius gave these marks to August's soldiers during the founder king's initial foray into the hinterlands.
13641 : Lest you think I play you for a fool yet again, take a close look at the handiwork. Such methods have been lost to the annals of time.
13642 : How would common trash get a hold of something like this?
13643 : ...I believe you, Ingrid. If anyone'd know the details of such wards, it'd be you.
13644 : Although I am quite certain of its authenticity, Hildebert will want to have a look himself.
13645 : Of course. But I'd be careful with that prickly bugger--once he's made up his mind, there's no convincing him otherwise.
13646 : Hmph. Leave him to me. If I can't make him see that this is for the good of the city, no one can.
13647 : Well, well...
13648 : It pains me to admit my gratitude, but...thank you. Jorius's relics'll usher in peace to those who have lost their way.
13649 : There is something mystical about this mark...something that goes beyond the mere divine.
13650 : Although I am quite certain of its authenticity, Hildebert will want to have a look himself.
13651 : Ah, yes. Perhaps it'll help bring Hildebert's wife back from her illness.
13652 : We can only hope. Though we have won a major victory, peace has not fully returned to our city.
13653 : %, you may not have expected me to say this, but...thank you.
13654 : Arciela would surely like to be apprised of what has transpired.
13655 : Morimar's answers only brought on more questions...and Hildebert's wife has yet to make a recovery.
13656 : I can sense the day of our next meeting is close.
13657 : Why, would you look--it's %!
13658 : Have you heard the wonderful news-wews? Faustoise has finally come to!
13659 : I've got to give Hildebert some creditaru--he's good for more than just airing his grievances.
13660 : O-oops! I think my inner-winner monologue just slipped out. Ta-ta for now!
13661 : %, did you have something to do with Faustoise's miraculous recovery?
13662 : Then perhaps it really was that old curmudgeon after all.
13663 : I came to see if that mark of Jorius that the old relic Morimar gave us could be of any use, but evidently I am not needed here.
13664 : Truth be told, I am quite relieved...for Marcellurin's sake.
13665 : Madam Faustoise?
13666 : Are you sure you feel well enough to take to the streets alone?
13667 : Oh, Ingrid!
13668 : My beloved Ingrid...how long has it been? You've gotten so tall...since I last laid these weary eyes on your sparkling blonde hair...
13669 : Wh-what!?
13670 : Come! We must return to the depths of Yorcia Weald...where the threads of fate intertwined.
13671 : No...it can't be...
13672 : %!
13673 : Where is my wife? No...where's Faustoise!?
13674 : Father, your anxiety is misplaced! Mother is surely in no condition to have gone far.
13675 : She is not your mother, nor my wife!
13676 : Some vile spirit...some thing...has taken over her body!
13677 : A vile spirit? But how...?
13678 : There is no time for your waffling! We must enlist the aid of the Peacekeepers forthwith!
13679 : I...do not understand. Mother headed for Yorcia Weald...and took Ingrid with her?
13680 : Why Ingrid?
13681 : Where the threads of fate intertwined. What would that have to do with Yorcia Weald?
13682 : Perhaps...perhaps the spirit taking over my mother is not malicious, but rather the spirit of Ingrid's mother herself.
13683 : Alucia's talents as an exorcist were beyond compare, and she had the heart and beauty to match.
13684 : A demonic presence residing in a small oak music box used her purity of spirit against her, leading to one of the most tragic tales of modern times.
13685 : The force lashed out, draining her of all her affinity for purgation.
13686 : It was not some months later that she left her daughter Ingrid behind and wandered out into the forest alone.
13687 : Her body was discovered a fortnight later, near a giant tree growing in the northwest of Yorcia Weald.
13688 : She could now be trying to guide Ingrid to that very spot.
13689 : We must stop her before the calamity is repeated.
13690 : Here. This will protect you.
13691 : Should you misplace it or otherwise have it wrested from your control, Rigobertine at the manse's entrance will provide you with another.
13692 : I shall meet up with you there.
13693 : Though we were initially relieved that Madam Faustoise awoke, I hesitate to say that she has made a true recovery.
13694 : Marcellurin indicated that he would head to a large tree in the northwestern section of Yorcia Weald.
13695 : My heart skips a beat to imagine that... Perhaps I am overthinking the danger. But please--hurry.
13696 : Marcellurin mentioned that you may have need of %.
13697 : They are quite valuable, but I know you will put this one to good use.
13698 : The prrrincess often ventures out into the jungle when her presence is not required at the castle.
13699 : Today is one such day. She mentioned going on a brrrief foray into Ceizak Battlegrounds.
13700 : Her strong sense of wanderrrlust has not faded even as she blossoms into a young woman. Would that I could stop her...
13701 : Is that... It is! %!
13702 : I cannot thank you enough for all you have done for the Orrrder of Renaye. What business have you today?
13703 : You say I should turrrn it on its side and read it that way? Let me see...
13704 : Oh my! Ikhi! Ikhi! You cerrrtainly must come see this!
13705 : %? Wherrre on Vana'diel did you come up with this?
13706 : Celennia Memorrrial Library?
13707 : Let me have a look... The higher power...change...spirit...garb...
13708 : A-amazing!
13709 : Could this possibly be handcrrrafted cloth dating back to the time of Sih Renaye?
13710 : It depicts trrraditional garb worn by those who have bonded their spirit with the higher power.
13711 : Rrreplicating it requires the finest ancient material Ulbuka has to offer...but where on the continent can we acquire it, given how far colonization has progressed?
13712 : And it requires that the wearer swear an oath to the higher power. But you would know all about that, wouldn't you? After all, you vowed [to bring harrrmony to nature in Adoulin/to prrrotect Adoulin's natural environment/to do everrrything possible to save nature].
13713 : Then if anyone, you have earned the rrright to don such vestments.
13714 : If you happen across % in your travels, be surrre to bring it to Wescolina in Western Adoulin.
13715 : Deep within the innermost recesses of Ulbuka, far beyond the Kamihr Drrrifts...lies a place unknown to any of us.
13716 : You will surely find your answers there, in a land nature has been unable to rrreclaim. Should you venture there, remain ever on your guard.
13717 : Should you come across % in your travels, bring it to Wescolina in Western Adoulin. If anyone can rrreplicate that attire, she can.
13718 : Handed over key item: %.
13719 : Your % rings out across the land, somehow resonating with the % and causing it to evolve.
13720 : The % has reclaimed its lost power, and your % silently crumbles to dust.
13721 : The % is bestowed with an incredible amount of runic energy, causing it to take on a more puissant form.
13722 : The % has reached the pinnacle of its evolution.
13723 : Your % decomposes instantly and is carried by the winds to the ends of Vana'diel.
13724 : You feel an ever-so-faint sense that a rune with [frigid/bright/transient] properties lies nearby.
13725 : You scribbled down some information regarding %.
13726 : You have obtained new information regarding your %.
13727 : Strange visions flood into your mind!
13728 : Fragments of shattered memories wedge themselves into your skull.
13729 : Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha? Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!
13730 : While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it. Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum. Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.
13731 : Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm!  Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'. Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?
13732 : Oh yeah, 'fore I forget. What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.
13733 : Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...
13734 : Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes. Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more. "Good things come tah dose who wait," right? Well, da longer ya wait, da gooder da thing...maybe. Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.
13735 : Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer daily tally. It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.
13736 : Finally, ya opens da chest. Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!
13737 : Oh, dat's right! Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase! Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?
13738 : And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy! But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.
13739 : Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it. Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.
13740 : Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble. It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.
13741 : Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in. Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.
13742 : Dat all make 'nough sense tah ya? Just say da woid when ya wanna use my services. I's more'n happy tah help.
13743 : Hey! I rem'mber seein' yer foice 'round here. Take a looksie. I's taken' it upon myself tah jigger 'round wit' dese all-new myst'ry boxes, found straight from an ol' capsized vessel in the Gugru Blue.
13744 : I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!
13745 : Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?
13746 : Dese're some special dials, an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!
13747 : Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese special dials? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.
13748 : So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.
13749 : 'N openin' 'em requires some kinda secret technique. Maybe it'll succeed, maybe tha box'll break. 'Sif I know. But ya can only try 'em once a day.
13750 : Oho, ya feelin' lucky 'nough tah takes a stab at da myst'ry box?
13751 : Whatcha gonna do? (# tally) Open the box and profit! Listen to the explanation. Inquire about my daily tally.  Peek at some possibilities. Nothing right now.
13752 : Ya wanna open dat sucker up? Okay, but which dial ya be wantin'?
13753 : Dat's da spirit! So which dial ya be wantin'?
13754 : So, what dial ya gonna pick? (# tally) I got cold feet, so none. Dial 1 (Materials): # tally. Dial 2 (Food): # tally. Dial 3 (Medicine): # tally. Dial 4 (Sundries 1): # tally. Dial 5 (Sundries 2): # tally. Special dial: # tally [/ (already opened)]. Adoulin dial: # tally[/ (already opened)]. Pictlogica dial: # tally[/ (already opened)].    Wanted dial: # tally[/ (already opened)].
13755 : Yer goin' wit' dial #, huh?  Whatchu tryin' ta pull!? Yer daily tally's too low.
13756 : Yer goin' wit' dial #, huh? Lessee what myst'ries await!
13757 : Dis box is full o' myst'ries, Dat span da realm's his'try, So whatcha gonna get from da chest...o'...uh, fortunery?
13758 : Oooh, looks at what popped out! I hopes it makes yer adventures dat much more adventumarous!
13759 : Ya's thought I threw yer prize away?! Prepostamarous! I's just tucked it away for safekeepin' is all.
13760 : You have used # [point/points] of your daily tally!
13761 : Wanna go again?
13762 : Keep goin'? Lemme at it! Thanks, but no thanks.
13763 : Yer daily tally? It's, um... Y'know, 'round # [point/points] or thereamabouts.
13764 : Lemme check for ya! Well, it coulda been %, %, or mebbe even %. What? Ya thinks ya could do better wit' one o' dese Gobbie masks on!?
13765 : Anywise, where'd da myst'ry be if ya's knew da answer 'fore ya opens it?
13766 : Some things is better left unknown. Gotta leave a little room fer romanchismo in da woild, y'know.
13767 : Dere we goes. Da myst'ry box seems tah like yer offerin'...but it wants more. Got anythin' else ya wanna throw away?
13768 : Dere we goes. Oho, looks like it don't wants no more. Guess ya gotta come back tomorrow if ya's wanna keep gettin' rid o' stuff.
13769 : Yer daily tally's increased [a smidge./someamawhats./a Gobby-fold!/a ginormagantic amount!]
13770 : Sorrah, but it won't lemme put dis in. Got anythin' it mights like better?
13771 : Sorrah, but da chest has dat look. Y'know, da one dat says, "I'll kills ya if ya tries tah give me dat." I guess alls ya can do is comes back some odda time.
13772 : Nah, it just won't woik. I's did my best, but yer daily tally just won't go no higher. Ya ain't gonna get no prizes by hoardin' yer points, so stop bein' such a Greedalox and use 'em.
13773 : Gil-lovin' Gobbies, %, ya's hit da jackpot! I's so happy for ya I think I's gettin' da vapors.
13774 : % obtains %!
13775 : Whoawhoawhoa! If ya's got business wit' da box, ya foist gots business wit' me. Whatcha need?
13776 : So ya be wantin' the special dial? Whoawhoawhoa! Get yer grubby hands offa that! Ya don't have enough daily tally, and I's not 'bout tah let ya cheat me!

13780 : Dun think that I's be a gil-grubbin' good-fer-nuthin'. If'n ya dun wanna open any dial, then I gives ya back yer %.
13781 : Yer eyes be bigger'n yer stomach. If'n ya wanna open [/Dial 1/Dial 2/Dial 3/Dial 4/Dial 5/the Special Dial///the abjuration dial/the fortune dial/the furnishings dial//the Vana'versary dial] usin' yer %, then ya gotta make room in yer bags!
13782 : What's be dis? %? What'm I 'pposed ta do wit it? I dun have any clue how ta use it, so take it home wit ya.
13783 : #<#

13807 : Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
13808 : Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.
13809 : Unity is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.
13810 : Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.
13811 : Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as %.
13812 : Chat settings may be changed by selecting Status from the main menu, and choosing Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
13813 : You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.
13814 : Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.
13815 : The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.
13816 : Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).
13817 : Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.
13818 : Wanted objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.
13819 : These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as Unity accolades to undertake.
13820 : Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.
13821 : Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.
13822 : The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.
13823 : A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.
13824 : Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.
13825 : Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.
13826 : When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.
13827 : Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.
13828 : No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.
13829 : You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.
13830 : An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.
13831 : One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.
13832 : A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.
13833 : You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.
13834 : Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.
13835 : Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.
13836 : Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.
13837 : The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.
13838 : It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.
13839 : The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.
13840 : Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.
13841 : These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.
13842 : Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.
13843 : Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of # accolades per week (Earth time).
13844 : You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.
13845 : This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.
13846 : This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.
13847 : However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.
13848 : Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.
13849 : The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.
13850 : Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.
13851 : Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.
13852 : On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.
13853 : Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by #. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.
13854 : The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.
13855 : Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.
13856 : Those with evaluations of # or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.
13857 : Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.
13858 : A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.
13859 : Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.
13860 : A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.
13861 : It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.
13862 : Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.
13863 : ou are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.
13864 : he A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.
13865 : ou call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.
13866 : ou have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.
13867 : hould you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?
13868 : Teleport anyway? Yes, please. No, thank you.
13869 : ...But come to think of it, some pioneers have been submitting rrreports of a most curious beast lurking outside the city gates.
13870 : Come to think of it, some pioneers have been submitting rrreports of a beast matching that description lurking outside the city gates.
13871 : But the orrrders have their own issues to face at present, and nary a hand can be spared.
13872 : A jesterrr? You're looking for a demon jester?
13873 : I'd like to help, but I've hearrrd no news of such a creature.
13874 : ...Though some pioneers have submitted reports about odd occurrences down in Rala Waterways. Something about black butterflies...
13875 : Balamor!? The very same crrreature that possessed Fremilla and knocked Chero-Machero flat on his back!?
13876 : I know just where to look: Rala Waterways. Pioneers have been submitting reports about strange black butterflies down there.
13877 : Ah, Princess!
13878 : ...I see. So Ceizak Battlegrounds has been more of a hot spot than usual.
13879 : You're looking for a dread fiend named Balamor?
13880 : This demon must be quite powerful if it can speak our language--and I take seriously any threat to my people.
13881 : Balamor... The wounds we suffered from what he did here may never heal.
13882 : I know this is a bit presumptuous of me to ask, but would you accompany me to Rala Waterways?
13883 : If we find those black butterflies, we may be able to find out more. I'll be along shortly.
13884 : C'mon %--to Rala Waterways!
13885 : If those black butterflies are what I think, then they might lead us to the truth.

13930 : Read the manual? Sure. No thanks.
13931 : Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.
13932 : Your goal is the [red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent's is the [blue/green/red] one on the left.
13933 : At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.
13934 : There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."
13935 : This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.
13936 : The three [red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,the three [blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent's,and the remaining two are neutral.
13937 : You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.
13938 : The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.
13939 : Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.
13940 : From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.
13941 : For example, if you select Area 1,one mandragora will move to Area 2and one will move to Area 3,and one will move to Area 4.
13942 : Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.
13943 : You will receive points known as jingly each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.
13944 : You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.
13945 : If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.
13946 : The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.
13947 : This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.
13948 : However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.
13949 : Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.
13950 : Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).
13951 : Korrigan and pachypodium: 2 jingly (first player)/3 jingly (second player).
13952 : Standard mandragoras: 1 jingly (both players).
13953 : The game is over when either you or your opponent no longer has any mandragoras that can move.
13954 : The player who has the most jingly at that point will be declared the winner.
13955 : The key to victory lies in taking advantage of the various mandragora subspecies bonuses while claiming multiple turns in a row.
13956 : Pattern [A/B/C/D/E] - Your Turn ([First Player/Second Player])

13985 : Very well, Lady Osahsha. You and % may enter.
13986 : Let's go.
13987 : This is my firstaru time in the Silver Knife. So this is what it looks like...
13988 : Simply put, it is under the Order of Gorney's jurisdiction, with Chero-Machero serving-werving as its director.
13989 : However, the items here are handled-wandled by the Couriers' Coalition, and Reginald is in charge of it all.
13990 : There are a variety of auctions held here. It seems thataru both the auction's contents and the invited guests are switched out on a regular basis.
13991 : This invitation I received is only valid-walid for the duration of the Auria Collection auction.
13992 : In other words, I believe we are free to roam aboutaru the place while the Auria Collection is being held.
13993 : By the way, I came here to meetaru with a dvergr known as Skokkr Undrborn.
13994 : However, looking around here, everybody appears pretty normal-wormal to me.
13995 : According to Valaineral's work deciphering the %, demons-wemons are able to disguise their form.
13996 : Therefore, there mightaru be some demons disguised as regular people among us here.
13997 : Yes, we should splitaru up and try talking with everyone.
13998 : I appreciate the assistaru, %.
13999 : Welcome back. You may enter.

14002 : Are you trying to scare someone dressed like that? Well, there is no dress code here, so you're free to pass...
14003 : Do you want to enter? Yes. Not right now.
14004 : If you wish to be someone worthy of the Silver Knife, you must not only work on your appearance, but your demeanor as well.
14005 : This is the Silver Knife. Only those who are worthy may enter.

14008 : Well!? Did you find the egg!?

14011 : So? What did you find out about the egg!?
14012 : What!? A demon took the World Eater Egg!?
14013 : And that demon's name is Skokkr Undrborn!?
14014 : I think I hear that name before...
14015 : Y-you're right... I believe he's the one who created the Prime Weapons five thousand years ago...
14016 : Oh! I knew that! Although, what is Prime Weapon?
14017 : Hmm... Maybe history can repeat itself?
14018 : Well, what other choice do we have! Let's go pay this Skokkr Undrborn a visit!
14019 : <Sigh> I really not like demons...
14020 : M-Magh Bihu, just keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine.
14021 : This is the Silver Knife. Only those who are worthy may enter.
