6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

6913 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
6914 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
6915 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
6916 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].

6921 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
6922 : Only # [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
6923 : We've beaten at least two...right?
6924 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
6925 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
6926 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...
6927 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6928 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
6929 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
6930 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6931 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
6932 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
6933 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
6934 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
6935 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6936 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
6937 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
6938 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
6939 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
6940 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
6941 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6942 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
6943 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
6944 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
6945 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6946 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6947 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6948 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6949 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.

7084 : What would you like to know? Nothing. I'm sorry. About performance assessment. About Allied Tags. About temporary items. About Unions.
7085 : I am sorry, but at this time, I cannot be of any assistance in that area.

7087 : Ah, I'm sorry to inform you that your performance has not earned you any compensation.
7088 : Understood. I shall prepare a new set of tags for you now.
7089 : You've already undergone an evaluation for this battle, or had you forgotten? As much as I'd like to, I'm forbidden from providing you with a new set of Allied Taegs until the next battle begins.
7090 : Anyone wearing Allied Tags while participating in a campaign battle will be judged on their overall performance.
7091 : Soldiers will be evaluated not only on their fighting skills, but also on how much they contribute to the efforts of their allies through means such as healing and enhancing.
7092 : However, beware that if you leave the area before being assessed, you will be deemed a deserter and will forfeit all rewards earned that day.
7093 : Also, while there are no immediate penalties for being knocked out, falling in battle will significantly lower the score given to you.
7094 : When you are ready to receive compensation for your work on the field, return to me and I shall assess your performance and provide you with your payment.
7095 : Allied Tags are a special type of identification given to all participants of Allied Campaign battles.
7096 : There are benefits, as well as drawbacks, to wearing the tags. One of the benefits is that in the case you are knocked out on the battlefield, you will not lose any experience points.
7097 : However, some of the drawbacks include the inability to improve skills and earn experience points for individual kills, as well as the right to loot fallen enemies.
7098 : Temporary items can be purchased in exchange for Allied Notes.
7099 : There are several different varieties of items, but they all have one thing in common--they can only be used on the battlefield they were issued.
7100 : It is highly recommended that you first survey a battle's conditions and then select the supplies that you believe will benefit you most.
7101 : Please remember that all temporary items you carry on your person will be confiscated in the event that you leave the area.
7102 : You can only purchase temporary items if your nation of allegiance is commanding the campaign.
7103 : That is all.
7104 : I will require a teleportation fee of # Allied Note[/s]. I see you currently possess #.

7130 : Oh ho! Keen to join a Union, are we? Very well. Listen up and I shall tell you all you need to know.
7131 : In order to better coordinate Allied efforts against the beastman menace, we have instituted a system of ad hoc tactical regiments called Unions. With five units to a battlefield, union registration is open to any proven soldier in possession of Allied Tags.
7132 : In return for their aid in advancing the war effort, union registrants will be eligible to earn a share of the spoils of war.
7133 : Needless to say, the choicest rewards will be reserved for those unions which make the greatest contributions in combat. Prove your mettle on the field of battle, and you will earn glory for your union, as well as a sizable bounty of your own.
7134 : Be forewarned that your commitment to your union comes first and foremost. In the aftermath of battle, you will not be permitted to reap rewards from your individual exploits until your union has distributed its plunder.
7135 : Caution! If a union member joins or leaves an existing party, that party's treasure pool will be distributed automatically and immediately.
7136 : Register for a union? Yes. No.

7297 : (DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!
7298 : Welcome, Master! This is your home, the Mog House, kupo!
7299 : I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!
7300 : I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!
7301 : First, the basics, kupo! Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to Mog House when you're in your Mog House, kupo!
7302 : Press it and the Mog House menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
7303 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
7304 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
7305 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
7306 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
7307 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
7308 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
7309 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
7310 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
7311 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
7312 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
7313 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
7314 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
7315 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
7316 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
7317 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
7318 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
7319 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
7320 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
7321 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
7322 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!
7323 : It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!
7324 : You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!
7325 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
7326 : Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
7327 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
7328 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
7329 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
7330 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
7331 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
7332 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
7333 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
7334 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
7335 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
7336 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
7337 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
7338 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
7339 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
7340 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
7341 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
7342 : It's all yours, kupo!
7343 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!
7344 : Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!

7357 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
7358 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
7359 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
7360 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
7361 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
7362 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
7363 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
7364 : Each item of furniture you place using the Layout command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
7365 : When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!

7374 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
7375 : Look what I found in your %!

7398 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
7399 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
7400 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
7401 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
7402 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
7403 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
7404 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
7405 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
7406 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
7407 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
7408 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
7409 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
7410 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
7411 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
7412 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
7413 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...

7492 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?

7494 : Thank you, kupo! I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!
7495 : Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
7496 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!
7497 : But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
7498 : Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!

7516 : Will this cursed war never end? My fishing boat's anchor now serves only to collect barnacles...
7517 : Listen to my story, if you will. You may be surprised to learn that I am a fisherman. However, the influence of the raging war has resulted in my profession being placed on an indefinite hiatus.
7518 : It was a most difficult decision, but under the current circumstances, a change in profession was for the best. Cuisine is where I have decided to try my luck. I plan to open a diner that caters to soldiers.
7519 : With the assistance of a knight friend of mine, I was able to obtain official permission to open shop. But the issue of supply procurement remains...
7520 : Fish cuisine is my specialty, but I trust you understand why that is problematic right now. Nowadays, beans are just about the only ingredient that can be obtained without needing to risk one's life.
7521 : So I thought to myself, If there is naught else to be had but beans, then so be it! Since then, I have toiled away many a day in the kitchen, trying to invent a mouthwatering bean dish, the likes of which no soul on Vana'diel has ever tasted.
7522 : Alas, the results have so far been discouraging.
7523 : Surely, a seasoning that can capture the hearts and palates of all people exists somewhere in this great wide world of ours...
7524 : Ah, this. I have tried it myself, but to no avail. The resultant bland flavor was less than inspiring.
7525 : Aaah... I am well acquainted with this one. I tried numerous methods of preparation, but in the end, its smell was so overpowering, at times I would forget I was eating beans.
7526 : No, this one did not work out. I had thought it promising, but was grievously betrayed. Any application of heat will have its flavor disappearing like magic.
7527 : Hmmm? This magnificent glitter...just like those you see on precious stones. I have a good feeling about this one.
7528 : Thank you kindly. I shall try cooking with it immediately.
7529 : Good Goddess!
7530 : The seasoning... It's amazing!
7531 : A little more of this will make it possible to bring out the bean's flavor to the fullest!
7532 : Why, I don't remember being this excited since reeling in the Lord of Lake Lufet after an epic eight-hour battle!
7533 : Might I be able to trouble you to acquire more of that seasoning?
7534 : What is this you have brought me? I appreciate your good intentions, but this is not what I asked for.
7535 : Yes, this is it! It shares the same enchanting glitter as the one you first brought...
7536 : I shall get to work right away. Will you stay and bear witness to what will surely become a historic moment?
7537 : Will you bear witness? If there's free food involved... Thanks, but no thanks.
7538 : Fabulous! Well then, come in! Come in!
7539 : There's no need to be shy, now. I insist!
7540 : Glorious! This is exactly the taste I was after!
7541 : Can you not feel the rich, flavorsome aroma permeating through your entire being?
7542 : Here, you simply must try it...
7543 : <Sniff, sniff> What's cookin', good-lookin'.
7544 : Hmmm...? Something's different today. Something smells gooooood!
7545 : Haha! It appears our scavengers have arrived!
7546 : For too long have I been corrupting your sense of smell with offensive odors. And I say that with a double meaning.
7547 : My very own specialty bean dish is now complete!
7548 : I can't stand it any longer! Can I have some, pretty please?
7549 : Me too! Me too!
7550 : Why, of course! It's piping hot, so don't go scalding your tongue on it, you hear?
7551 : So...tell me what you think, little ones.
7552 : Wow! It's like the beans are having a party in my mouth...and everyone's invited!
7553 : I love it, I love it! I could eat this every day for the rest of my life!
7554 : <Chuckle> Such comments from the mouths of children are most reassuring. Now I can finally start the business without reserve.
7555 : I owe all this to you, for finding a seasoning so delectable, it borders on miraculous. This new bean dish is bound to delight both citizens and knights alike.
7556 : The wretched beastmen may try to break down our walls, but we shall return the favor by breaking them with our wind! Mwahahahaha!
7557 : A-ahem! Please be so kind as to forget that rather unsavory outburst. Now, before I forget, I was intending to ask you...
7558 : Was the seasoning you brought %?
7559 : Well, was it? Good guess! Wrong.
7560 : I knew it! It seems my fisherman's instincts are still alive and well.
7561 : No, I am certain of it. Only with Lufet salt could one aspire to achieve such a distinct flavor.
7562 : I must find a way to procure a stable supply. Perhaps I can negotiate a delivery deal with the knights...
7563 : Thank you again. Right now there is naught I can do in return, but I will not soon forget your kindness.
7564 : Ah, superb timing!
7565 : Since that day, I was able to make arrangements through my knight friend.
7566 : The knights have agreed to deliver % to me--on the condition that I make the bean dish for their rations! This will surely keep me busy for a while.
7567 : Though my plans for the diner have been postponed, I appreciate this opportunity to contribute in my own small way to the war effort. Heheh...
7568 : The sooner the war ends, the sooner I can return to sea and resume working as a fisherman.
7569 : Until then, I shall leave my anchor lowered right here, in San d'Oria.
7570 : I've been wanting you to taste my new specialty, %. After all, it is to you that this dish owes its existence.
7571 : Please drop by anytime. I look forward to seeing you again.
7572 : Until the war ends, I shall leave my anchor lowered right here, in San d'Oria.
7573 : I have just now finished cooking another batch of %. This is for you, fresh from the fire! These are hard times, but there is nothing a little effort won't see us through.
7574 : Oh, it appears I was mistaken... The % still needs to simmer for a while yet, so please drop by again later.
7575 : <Sniff, sob>... Oh, do h-help me, kind [sir/miss]! I c-came here with my father, but now he's...he's gone!
7576 : Help the boy find his father? Of course! Find him yourself.
7577 : Well, if it isn't Exoroche! Got separated from daddy dearest again, did we?
7578 : Hah! One can hardly blame him for wanting to be rid of a crybaby like you!
7579 : My father's going to show me how to fight with his xiphos. A pity you're too busy bawling your eyes out, or I'd let you tag along. Ta-ta!
7580 : <Sniff, sniff>... Father... Wherever did you go...?
7581 : The child is too distraught to provide you with any information. His name, however, strikes you as strangely familiar...
7582 : What? You f-found my father, you say?
7583 : Exoroche! Where did you run off to this time!?
7584 : That's him!
7585 : Why, you spineless milksop! Get yourself lost, and all you can do is wail and whimper 'til some passerby takes pity on you? Have you no shame!?
7586 : But F-Father...
7587 : Enough of your sniveling! You are Elvaan! You are to conduct yourself with honor and dignity at all times!
7588 : B-but...but F-Father...!
7589 : I'll forge you into shape yet! You can stand there alone until you figure out what it means to act like a man!
7590 : No, Father! Why must you be so cruel? Don't leave me!
7591 : My apologies for any trouble imposed upon you by my lily-livered brat of a son.
7592 : Please accept this in return for your efforts.
7593 : What? But Father... That's my f-favorite %!
7594 : Silence! Until you dry those shameful tears, you are no son of mine!
7595 : M-my %...<sniff>... Without it, I c-cannot...<sob>...
7596 : C-could it be? You've come to return this to me?
7597 : Oh, thank you ever so much! This is the % that I shall wield to protect my family and Kingdom when I become a great, strong knight!
7598 : And yet...I cannot accept it from you.
7599 : Father has forbidden me from bearing arms save for as part of my weapons training. I can receive this sword only when he deems me...<sniff>...worthy of it once more.
7600 : <Sniff>... You are too kind, [milord/milady]. But I can accept that % when Father himself returns it to me, and not before.
7601 : The % was returned to you.
7602 : Exoroche!
7603 : Father...
7604 : She's a beauty, is she not? My hard-won catch of the day!
7605 : And I believe this is yours as well.
7606 : C-could it be!? My %!
7607 : Thank you, Father!
7608 : Bah! Were it my decision, you'd not have seen it again until you were a man grown. You have the generosity of this stranger here to thank.
7609 : Oh, you truly are too kind! [Milord/Milady], ah...
7610 : Thank you, [Milord/Milady] %!
7611 : Well, now that you have a blade again, I suppose I must teach you to swing it without lopping off your own extremities.
7612 : Truly? On my honor, Father, I shan't let you down!
7613 : Oho! There's a spirited reply. I just might make a knight of you yet!
7614 : Hail, Exoroche! What a charming little % you have there. A fitting toy for a child such as yourself, methinks.
7615 : Me, I've already received a xiphos from my father. A true knight's weapon, you see.
7616 : Perhaps we can spar sometime. Should you ever feel the need for a proper bruising, that is! Hahaha!
7617 : <Sniff>... F-Father...
7618 : Hear me well, Exoroche.
7619 : Let others say as they will.
7620 : In the end, 'tis not the mightiest sword, nor even the savviest fencer who shall win the day. It is the one with honor and justice on his side.
7621 : Remember this always, discipline yourself in mind and body, and you will grow strong.
7622 : Yes, Father! One day, I shall be the strongest, bravest knight in the Kingdom! I will make you proud!
7623 : I've not felt such a close bond with my son in quite some time. I am in your debt, %.
7624 : As it seems the lad will have need of his % after all, pray accept this instead as a token of my gratitude.
7625 : The boy may be tender in years, but his heart is true. I shall endeavor to see him raised to be as strong and honorable as yourself.
7626 : I may have neither the strongest arm nor the sharpest blade, but I shall always fight for honor and justice!

10795 : This is Watchdog Alley. Have you come to view the Orc prisoner?
10796 : He's right over there. The Royal Knights caught the fiend and threw him in a cage as a warning to his foul brethren.
10797 : This Orc appears to speak our language surprisingly well. You may approach if you wish.
10798 : (Blast... Someone's coming...)
10799 : W-wait! We're not done here, Darvylle!
10800 : Hm...?
10801 : H-hello, kind stranger! Listen to my tale...if it please you!
10802 : I understand that you may be loath to believe one in my situation...
10803 : But I am, in actual fact, an Elvaan--a descendant of House Aurchiat.
10804 : This unlovely form is the result of a witch's curse.
10805 : Behold this signet ring. It bears the coat of arms of House Aurchiat, and is all I retain of my identity.
10806 : The symbol of a unicorn adorns the ring.
10807 : The Temple Knight here before you was the merciful Sir Darvylle. He chose to believe my tale.
10808 : He also chose to leave me with a ring of keys--including the one to this cage.
10809 : Without a thought for his own position, Sir Darvylle is graciously allowing me one last look at the faces of my beloved family...
10810 : I could not let fear make a mockery of his generosity.
10811 : Yet when I stretched out a hand to work the lock on the outside of the cage, I was stymied...
10812 : These cursed Orc arms are as thick as table hams! I could not fit my limbs through the bars!
10813 : Ugh...
10814 : I promise not to flee. Will you not open the cage in my stead?
10815 : Open the cage? Give me the keys, then. Nice try.
10816 : My dear wife and doting child abide in my estate...
10817 : If I might peek in...if only from the shadows... I must see my family once more while my heart yet beats!
10818 : Thank you!
10819 : I shall return the keys myself. I cannot have the guards believing you aided in my escape.
10820 : Now I must away before the alarm is raised.
10821 : Blessed child of Altana! If only I could meet you as my true self!
10822 : Have a nice conversation with our Orcish guest? Where did he learn to speak so eloquently, I wonder...
10823 : That chatty Orc has escaped!
10824 : But not before releasing all the other prisoners...
10825 : There is evidence at the scene that the Orc was supplied with %. We have a traitor in our midst.
10826 : The escape was noticed after the changing of the guard. Could this have happened during my watch...?
10827 : We have every able-bodied Temple Knight available assigned to the search, but...hm?
10828 : If the knights choose to do nothing, then the Young Griffons will take matters into their own hands!
10829 : Excenmille... Leave military matters to your elders. Now, return home and cease this unseemly conduct.
10830 : ...!!!
10831 : That is your answer to everything, Father! It is the same tired answer you gave when--
10832 : Excenmille!
10833 : Rahal. What is afoot?
10834 : Bistillot's work is complete!
10835 : Truly!?
10836 : Yes! We must make haste to the meeting place.
10837 : It shall be the Young Griffons who end this war! The elders of this kingdom couldn't be trusted to lace their own boots!
10838 : Who is that, you ask? That, my friend, is Count Alphonimile M Aurchiat, a Royal Knight and lord of the territory of Norvallen.
10839 : I have only myself to blame for the behavior of my son and heir...
10840 : Ever since the incident when the Bloodwing Horde enclosed the capital in their merciless grip, the streets have grown increasingly dangerous.
10841 : Our high-ranking knights are being targeted by Tonberry assassins. Why, General Mouchand of the Temple Knights was slain not three days ago.
10842 : And now we have this incident with prisoners running free. The security of San d'Oria is compromised. We must all be on our guard.
10843 : The count has not had time to rest since the Battle of Jugner.
10844 : If he had but mobilized a larger force during that battle, the Knights of Norvallen might still be with us today...
10845 : And with the loss of General Mouchand, Count Aurchiat will have a hard time coordinating the actions of the Royal and Temple Knights.
10846 : It also appears we face a cunning adversary in the Orcs, if that prison break is truly of their making.
10847 : Perhaps the Young Griffons will become our last bastion of hope, after all... I jest, of course.
10848 : Who are the Young Griffons? Ah, merely a name those enthusiastic youths have given to themselves.
10849 : They employ the small courtyard further into Watchdog Alley as a meeting place. I hear they don't appreciate intrusions into their territory.
10850 : Could this prison break have happened during my watch...?
10851 : The small courtyard further into Watchdog Alley is a meeting place for a group of young, would-be knights. I hear they don't appreciate intrusions into their territory.
10852 : The small courtyard further into Watchdog Alley is a meeting place for a group of young, would-be knights.
10853 : I shall pass on to you any information we receive regarding the escape. You have spoken with the cur, and may have a better chance of understanding how he thinks.
10854 : Hold where you are, intruder! This is the territory of the Young Griffons! State your business, or begone!
10855 : Do you mind, Rholont? You're awfully loud, and it's very hard to concentrate...
10856 : Now, if I push this while twisting that...
10857 : Th-the captain and lieutenant have returned!
10858 : Young Griffons! Fall in!
10859 : Captain Excenmille! Lieutenant Rahal! Welcome back from your mission!
10860 : At ease, Sentinel Rholont.
10861 : Engineer Bistillot!
10862 : Some quiet, if you please, Captain.
10863 : Come out of there and let's see this--
10864 : Excenmille...
10865 : Hm? What is it?
10866 : We have an intruder.
10867 : Why is there an elder here!?
10868 : Sentinel Rholont! You have not forgotten the third rule, I trust?
10869 : No, sir!
10870 : The third rule of the Young Griffon charter states that no elder may be permitted entrance into our territory!
10871 : Then why have you been remiss in your duty!?
10872 : You there!
10873 : I know not your business here, but you are trespassing on Young Griffon land. Begone at once!
10874 : Captain Excenmille!
10875 : Now what!?
10876 : Royal Squire Altennia approaches!
10877 : Well, well. Are we all playing nicely together?
10878 : Your vigilance is to be commended, Sentinel Rholont.
10879 : You honor me, Squire Altennia!
10880 : Hello? Is this a new member of your merry band, Excenmille?
10881 : This cad!? Most certainly not! [He/She] is trespassing in our territory!
10882 : Is that so?
10883 : Greetings, I am Altennia of House Borel, a Royal Squire.
10884 : And you are...?
10885 : A pleasure to meet you, %.
10886 : Squire Altennia. Please interrogate the intruder elsewhere!
10887 : Very well, no need to pull rank, Captain.
10888 : Shall we speak where we shan't disturb our brave young knights?
10889 : It appears some matter weighs heavily on your mind.
10890 : Let the War Council come to order!
10891 : You were taken in by an Orc's trickery and aided in his escape?
10892 : ...
10893 : I find myself inclined to believe you. No one could invent such an unlikely tale.
10894 : An Orc bearing a unicorn signet ring and claiming to belong to House Aurchiat...? And then there's the matter of Temple Knight Darvylle and his ring of keys.
10895 : But how could this Orc have the signet ring of House Aurchiat?
10896 : It is carried on the person of Count Alphonimile at all times...
10897 : And why would Sir Darvylle...? I think I have an idea.
10898 : Would you listen to my request, %?
10899 : I want you to act as a guardian for these children.
10900 : With all the strange happenings about the city these days, I fear for their safety.
10901 : I would prefer to shoulder that responsibility myself, but my duties keep me busy.
10902 : In return, I shall keep your part in the prison break just between you and me.
10903 : Young Griffons! I told % you would allow [him/her] to join your order.
10904 : Y-you what!? Squire Altennia! This was not discussed! I shan't allow it!
10905 : I support your decision, Captain Excenmille!
10906 : As do I. This flies in the face of everything for which the Young Griffons stand.
10907 : We are unanimous. The risks of embracing an untested stranger into our order are astro--
10908 : Pish-posh! Now stop being so unfriendly and welcome your new member.
10909 : Now, I must return to my post. I do not want to hear of any bickering while I am gone!
10910 : You cannot do this! Take this intruder with you!
10911 : What do we do, Captain?
10912 : ...
10913 : Engineer Bistillot. Is your project truly complete?
10914 : Yes, Captain. I had to leave some of the finer details to an expert, but now that I think about it, the construction should not have been so complicated.
10915 : The shell, to start with--
10916 : All I wanted to know was if it was finished or not!
10917 : I know, Captain. I was merely testing your patience.
10918 : You'll find the % inside that box.
10919 : Excellent.
10920 : Intruder! Ah, I mean, %!
10921 : I have devised a way to test your suitability for the Young Griffons.
10922 : Are you sure about this, Captain?
10923 : Positive! If this new recruit can follow my orders to the letter, I may just find a place for [him/her] at the next council meeting.
10924 : Listen up, recruit! I have a task for you!
10925 : You are to distribute these % to the elders we name. They are simply...good luck charms.
10926 : Sentinel Rholont. Read aloud the names of our targets.
10927 : Sir! Yes, sir!
10928 : Ahem... The targets are as follows.
10929 : Count Alphonimile M Aurchiat of the Royal Knights!
10930 : However, he is quite busy, so it is permitted to leave his charm with City Guard Louxiard.
10931 : Continuing on! Iron Ram Captain Rongelouts N Distaud!
10932 : Royal Knight Sabiliont!
10933 : Royal Guard Lieutenant Phillieulais! Hmm, he is on field duty, but can be reached through Royal Knight Machionage!
10934 : Temple Knight Darvylle! Out of the city? Then you are to leave it with Temple Knight Loillie!
10935 : And lastly, Temple Knight Elnonde and Temple Knight Illeuse!
10936 : Seven elders in total!
10937 : You heard him, recruit! Deliver those charms! On the double!
10938 : Your targets are as follows.
10939 : City Guard Louxiard!
10940 : Iron Ram Captain Rongelouts! Royal Knight Sabiliont!
10941 : Royal Knight Machionage! Temple Knight Loillie!
10942 : Temple Knight Elnonde! And lastly, Temple Knight Illeuse!
10943 : Seven targets in total!
10944 : A good luck charm from the Young Griffons?
10945 : I need nothing more than my sword arm to protect me from harm! And you can pass that on to those impudent young maggots!
10946 : Hmph, I suppose it was offered in good faith. I shall take it, then.
10947 : You wish me to hand this to Count Aurchiat? Very well. The captain of the Young Griffons must worry for his father's safety...
10948 : A charm from the Young Griffons? Splendid! I shall wear it into battle with pride. Send my thanks to those thoughtful lads!
10949 : This charm is to be delivered to Lieutenant Phillieulais? I shall hold onto it until he returns from the battlefield.
10950 : Ah, what a pretty...feather. And this is for Sir Darvylle, you say? He will be thrilled, I am sure...
10951 : From the Young Griffons...? What a compassionate gesture. May Altana watch over their gentle hearts...
10952 : The Young Griffons sent you? Ah, I see. A gesture of support from one knightly order to another. The Temple Knights must strive to meet their high expectations!
10953 : You misplaced the %!?
10954 : I must report this infraction to the captain!
10955 : I suggest you return after his wrath has had time to cool.
10956 : Engineer Bistillot has been kind enough to prepare more % for you.
10957 : You have a duty to perform, recruit! Do not disappoint the captain again!
10958 : How fares your mission? I shall stand fast until Captain Excenmille arrives!
10959 : Is everyone assembled? And what of the recruit...?
10960 : Hmm. So, you completed your mission?
10961 : Very well, %! You have earned the right to attend our next council meeting. As much as I loathe this decision, a knight's word is his honor.
10962 : And this is from Squire Altennia. I know not its use.
10963 : Attention! The next War Council will take place here at the usual time!
10964 : Dismissed!
10965 : The War Council is about to commence!
10966 : Eyes front! Let the council begin!
10967 : First, I shall cover the intelligence report compiled by Engineer Bistillot.
10968 : According to the information we gathered through the link...er, through our sources...
10969 : Our elders have learned that the Bloodwing Horde is occupying the western half of Batallia Downs, and are planning an assault on their position.
10970 : The Bloodwing Horde? Is that not the very same horde that laid siege to our capital?
10971 : Indeed. This vicious army is led by Doggvdegg, a massive Orc often mounted on a bugard. The Royal Knights barely managed to beat them back from the walls...
10972 : This Orcish commander is considered so dangerous that a plan was devised wherein the Royal Knights and Temple Knights would fall upon the Bloodwings in a united attack.
10973 : Such an operation could scarce fail! What befell!?
10974 : The operation has yet to be executed.
10975 : What is the meaning of this, Rahal?
10976 : Ever since the assassination of General Mouchand...ah...
10977 : Engineer Bistillot, if you would be so kind?
10978 : Before the opening of hostilities, many of the knights who supported this operation had fallen prey to a succession of assassinations.
10979 : This has naturally led to a serious delay in the mobilization of the troops.
10980 : And now the first cooperative operation since the start of the war is no longer--
10981 : Confound it! This is what happens when you leave matters to those squabbling fools!
10982 : And now this Doggvdegg is roaming unchecked.
10983 : Then our duty is clear! We shall defeat these fiends ourselves! Tomorrow, we march to Batallia for Operation Clean and Sweep!
10984 : Captain, in this case, Clean and Sweep is not entirely accurate...
10985 : One moment. How in the name of the Goddess are the Young Griffons supposed to triumph over an enemy the Royal Knights fear to tackle without the support of the Temple Knights?
10986 : We shall decide that on the field.
10987 : ...
10988 : Captain Excenmille! Royal Squire Altennia approaches.
10989 : How fare you, Young Griffons?
10990 : It seems % has been accepted into your ranks.
10991 : ...
10992 : What befalls? This silence speaks volumes even if you do not.
10993 : This better not be some reckless new plan in the making...
10994 : Your decision to scout out Gigas activity on Gerlvan Isle was the last straw for my support of your operations.
10995 : W-we are planning nothing of the sort. This is more of a Clean and Sweep...
10996 : Clean and Sweep...?
10997 : Ah...you see...
10998 : Captain, as I stated before, Clean and Sweep is not--
10999 : We need to clean up this territory. The mess is unbefitting of a knightly order.
11000 : E-exactly! What are you waiting for, Griffons!? Brooms! Rakes! I want this area spotless!
11001 : That is a relief. I thought for a moment you meant Clean and Sweep in military terms.
11002 : Very well, I shall leave you to your most important operation.
11003 : (Keep an eye on them, %!)
11004 : Phew. That was close. If Altennia knew of our plans, she would shirk her duties just to thwart us.
11005 : %. Be warned that if you so much as entertain the thought of betraying us to Altennia, your place in the Young Griffons is forfeit!
11006 : Eyes front! Operation Clean and Sweep commences at first light tomorrow!
11007 : Dismissed!
11008 : I have a message for you from the captain.
11009 : Operation Clean and Sweep has been moved forward.
11010 : Rendezvous with the main force in Batallia Downs.
11011 : Those are your orders!
11012 : The main force has likely reached the trails of Jugner Forest by now...
11013 : I shall remain here and guard the base!
11014 : The War Council will take place here on the morrow!
11015 : My duty is to remain here and guard the base!
11016 : Captain Excenmille's force has likely reached the trails of Jugner Forest by now...
11017 : You cannot pledge your allegiance to San d'Oria while undertaking the initiation ritual of another nation. Go sever your ties with that nation, then come speak with me once more.
11018 : Greetings, %. How fare thee amongst the ranks of the Rams?
11019 : Currently, we are recruiting squires to serve within the Royal Knights' Iron Ram regiment. Serve your king, defend your nation, and possibly earn a chance at nobility... What say you?
11020 : If you seek admission, you will first require a %.
11021 : Ah, I see that you currently proffer your services to another nation.
11022 : If you wish to join our noble ranks, you must first sever all ties with that organization and pledge allegiance to the crimson lion.
11023 : Only then will you be allowed to walk the path of initiation.
11024 : Is this what you wish?
11025 : So, you have come to join the Knights of the Iron Ram...
11026 : Let me see your letter of recommendation... Ah, yes, this will do.
11027 : I must inform you, once you begin the initiation, you will be bound to San d'Oria. Other nations will not accept you into their ranks while your bonds to the Kingdom remain intact. Forget this not.
11028 : And so now I must ask, do you pledge to serve the king and his people with your life and honor?
11029 : Pledge allegiance to San d'Oria? Yes. No.
11030 : Then I can assist you no longer. Begone.
11031 : You shall now be granted the opportunity to prove your worth. Only after you have done so will you be admitted to the ranks of the Rams.
11032 : Now let us begi--
11033 : Did you not witness the conflagration that scorched the early-morning heavens?
11034 : The Bastokan heretics have once again defied the laws of the benevolent Altana with their godless warmachines.
11035 : Can you be so certain, Hestrefalcat? To me it closely resembled a great, fiery dragon, diving down to seize her prey.
11036 : Mayhap it was a wicked omen, portending the advent of a great evil...
11037 : The eyes of the youth see only that which they wish. 'Twas not a mysterious weapon nor a portent of doom; 'twas the smouldering carcass of a flying wooden beast, I tell you!
11038 : Gods forfend! Sir Rachelassiond, are you to have us believe that trees can fly!?
11039 : Wh-why, I...!
11040 : I apologize for the intrusion. Gossip runs rampant among our ranks, but there is little we can do to stop it. However, this time, there seems to be some truth behind the prattling of the knights, for our scouts also recorded countless sightings of this queer phenomenon.
11041 : Unfortunately, the details contained in these reports were quite sketchy. Some claimed the flames to be a weapon of some sort, while others swore it was a hideous daemon, spawned from the loins of the Shadow Lord himself.
11042 : Whatever the case, it is our duty to determine the truth behind this episode and quell the rumors surrounding it before unwanted panic spreads to the common folk.
11043 : And that shall be your test. I wish you to travel into the nearby holt and search for clues.
11044 : Once you have found at least three leads, report back to me. I shall be waiting here.
11045 : How fares the search, %? I will listen to your report once you have found three pieces of conclusive evidence regarding the unidentified object.
11046 : Or perhaps you have found your trial too taxing?
11047 : Give up? No! I have had enough...
11048 : Excellent. I look forward to your findings.
11049 : Why, this is most unexpected. Can I not convince you to act otherwise?
11050 : It would be a pity to see you go. Alright, I shall try once more. I am sorry. I cannot continue.
11051 : I see... However, I shall not close the gates behind you, %. If you ever wish to return, you will be granted another chance to redeem yourself. Fare thee well.
11052 : Welcome back, %! Have you changed your mind regarding the Knights of the Iron Ram?
11053 : Will you apply for membership? Yes. Not today, sir.
11054 : Wonderful! Now let us begin your trial.
11055 : First, I regret to say that while we continued our search for clues surrounding the fiery object in your absence, we found nothing of import.
11056 : We would have you return to East Ronfaure and locate any object that may shed light on the mystery before us.
11057 : Once you have found three, bring them back here for inspection.
11058 : That is unfortunate. However, I shall be waiting here if you happen to have a change of heart.
11059 : Welcome back, %. Were you successful in your investigation?
11060 : Why, this looks like the blade of a windmill... But the closest ones lie hundreds of malms away in the Konschtat Highlands...
11061 : And these crystals... The formations seem to have continued growing even after they pierced the wood...
11062 : Finally, this plate... I believe I can make out the letters E, O, and...S...
11063 : Eos? What on Vana'diel could it mean...?
11064 : I see one of your recruits has come across some items of ours. If you would be so kind as to hand them over immediately.
11065 : Stand down, knave! State your name and whence you came!
11066 : Ah, and this would be a portion of the right propeller. I clearly expressed my doubts about the pliability of elm...
11067 : Do not make me repeat myself!
11068 : Our fears as to the fate of the Eos are confir--
11069 : Spencer!
11070 : I apologize for my colleague's lack of refinement. The items you have recovered are the lawful property of the archduke of Jeuno and must be transported back to the Duchy for further study.
11071 : Absurd! Your laws have no authority here in San d'Oria!
11072 : Now begone at once before I am inclined to use force!
11073 : Captain. You will abide by the wishes of our venerable guests from Jeuno.
11074 : Commander! But I--
11075 : That is enough, Sir Mainchelite. What is your duty as Royal Knight captain?
11076 : Sir! To protect the king and enforce his will. But I do not see h--
11077 : His Majesty has granted the ducal ambassadors full authority regarding this investigation. Impertinence will not be tolerated.
11078 : Hmph! An outrage! With what manner of sophistries have these fiends poisoned our king?
11079 : I will ignore that outburst, Sir Knight. Now, I believe you heard the commander. Hand over the items.
11080 : Mainchelite reluctantly hands Gerwulf the %, the %, and the %.
11081 : On behalf of the archduke, I thank the Royal Knights for their assistance in this matter. And as a precaution, we ask that you do not speak of your findings to anyone, understood?
11082 : ...the incorporation of additional control flaps in conjunction with an upgrade from elm to mahoga--
11083 : Spencer! Let us be on our way.
11084 : Hold, outsiders.
11085 : Might you be speaking to us, Commander?
11086 : You have worn dry your welcome, travelers. Do not expect a reprise of the king's generosity, should another misfortune befall your nation.
11087 : ...... I shall relay that to the archduke, sir. Good day.
11088 : Ah, a new recruit, perhaps?
11089 : I apologize for the display. However it may pain us, our first and foremost duty is to uphold the will of the king.
11090 : Remember that. If there is anything else you require, speak with Lady Fiaudie yonder. She will brief you on your new responsibilities.
11091 : I commend you on your performance, %. You have displayed great courage and ingenuity, and proved your worth thricefold. You are hereby granted admission to the Knights of the Iron Ram. Congratulations.
11092 : Please accept this % to commend the beginning of your military career. Speak with Evaluation Official Fiaudie for a detailed briefing on the decoration.
11093 : ou are now a member of the Knights of the Iron Ram!
11094 : You wish to rejoin the ranks of the Iron Rams? Splendid! Speak with Sir Houilloumie to begin your reinstatement.
11095 : Howdy, pardner! Y'know whadda ladybug is? Beetle-like vermin, red shell with black spots... Ring a cowbell?
11096 : Ahhh, sorry, sorry. The name's Wyatt, an' I be an armor merchant from Jeuno. Ended up 'ere in San d'Oria some way or another, though.
11097 : T'tell you the truth, jes' between you an' me, a friend o' mine in the industry let me in on a little rumor's bayn goin' around. Seems there's a new type o' armor's bayn developed as o' late.
11098 : An' apparently, it takes a raht mess o' % t'make it.
11099 : Seein' as how I be jes' a lowly merchant, I can't jes' go out an' start killin' ladybugs whenever I fancy. So I'm lookin' t'buy up as many as I can, an' then t'make a fortu--I mean, to aid in the war effort. Y'know, do mah part. Dewty as a citizen an' all that.
11100 : That's where you come in. I was thinkin' t'mahself, an experienced adventurer such as yurself maht be able t'help me out.
11101 : If you could get yur hands on some % and sell 'em to me four adda time, I'd be willin' t'pay a pretty gil fur 'em.
11102 : Y'get some gil in yur pocket, I get the materials I need. Sounds like a win-win situation t'me.
11103 : No need t'rush. Jes' bring me some % whenever you gedda chance.
11104 : Wouldn't happen to have come across any more o' them %, would you? If you do, make sure you bring 'em t'me. Mah offer's still good.
11105 : Oooh! Now these'll do jes' fine! Perfect shape, an' look at that shine! A splendid bunch o' % indeed!
11106 : All right, you kept yur side o' the bargain, so I'll do the same. Hope you don't mind Jeuno coinage.
11107 : Hey, would that be % you got there?
11108 : Y'see, I happen t'be a player on the stock market. So if you're in a bind as t'what to do with that, I'd be willin' t'trade you cash fur it.
11109 : Y'want gil, you say? You one o' them cosmopolitan types?
11110 : Lessee now... Takin' the current market situation into account, this'll cash in fur around # gil. Alrighty then, here's yur gil. Minus commission, that is.
11111 : The king's forest is crawling with Orcs! Take care, lest you find yourself roasting on a spit over one of their campfires!

11147 : % bows deeply.
11148 : One of my many duties entails lending an ear to the grievances of my brave brothers and sisters.
11149 : Might there be something troubling you, %?
11150 : I have an opinion regarding: Privacy issues. Our commanders. Our battle strategies. Our internal policies. Nothing.
11151 : Worry not, my child. Your name will be revealed to no one.
11152 : Feel free to express whatever feelings you may have, without fear of future reprisal.
11153 : However, this does not necessarily guarantee your wishes will be granted.
11154 : While the royaulais makes it a point to consider the opinions of his subjects, the final decision regarding whether or not to implement a new course of action lies solely with His Highness.
11155 : I see... I have recorded your words and shall present them to the royaulais himself.
11156 : Understood. However, if you ever wish to make your voice heard, speak with me.
11157 : And should a shroud of darkness veil the Light of dawn, the undying hope in mine heart would guideth me through the abyss to the Promised--
11158 : Ah, my apologies, wayward lamb, but I have not yet finished my daily prayer. Please, allow me to concentrate, lest I offend the Goddess with wildering driveling.
11159 : Ah, our fine generals.
11160 : A leader of men is only as strong as the trust placed upon him by his followers. His Majesty would do well to know who among his commanders has earned the respect of the people.
11161 : %, tell me which general you believe the most competent.
11162 : Who would you follow to death? Royal Guard General Davilles. Royal Knight General Cousseraux. Temple Knight General Brunnaut. Provincial Knight General Rouhent. Provincial Knight General Virgaut. Reserve Knight General Leonoyne. I require more time to consider.
11163 : Ah, Valaineral R Davilles, heir to the Davilles line. Known by many for his warm personality, this master of the blade is said to transform into a beast when on the battlefield.
11164 : Ah, Lord Yrvaulair S Cousseraux--the years have taken little from this expert tactician. Specializing in sieges, the brave general excels when faced with a fortress in need of breaching.
11165 : Ah, Cardinal Febrenard C Brunnaut... Striving hard day and night to maintain peace within the walls of the capital. While the youngest of our nation's generals, he is often the most composed.
11166 : Ah, Lord Rouhent of the Knights of Norvallen--a hero amongst men, known for putting the needs of his knights before all else. Missions of reprovisioning are among his specialties.
11167 : Ah, Lady Virgaut of the Knights of Aragoneu. Let not her pulchritudinous visage fool you, for she is perhaps one of the finest generals in the Kingdom. Her scouts' ability to gather intelligence on the enemy, combined with her ability to apply that knowledge to constructing precise battle tactics, is known across Vana'diel.
11168 : Ah, Sir Leonoyne of the Knights of the Savage Hound--a cold-blooded warrior who earned his nobility after a showing of unmatched bravery on the battlefield. Highly regarded by the royaulais, his ruthless methods strike fear into those beastmen who dare challenge his knights.
11171 : Do you believe he is our Kingdom's top general?
11172 : He is... The best we have! ...
11173 : Interesting...
11174 : Wait one moment...
11175 : I seem to recall you recently stating [Royal Guard General Davilles/Royal Knight General Cousseraux/Temple Knight General Brunnaut/General Feldrautte I Rouhent/General Cerane I Virgaut/Reserve Knight General Leonoyne] was our most reliant leader.
11176 : So you feel there may be something amiss with our nation's current battle strategy.
11177 : Which path do you feel would benefit us most?
11178 : Which do you suggest? A preemptive strike. Diversionary tactics. Battleline preservation. Stronghold defenses. Troop conditioning. Troop training. Reconnaissance. Sabotage. Nothing.
11179 : Quite an aggressive tactic... On the other hand, a preemptive strike can be the quickest way to bring new regions under San d'Orian control, even if it results in heavier losses.
11180 : Quite a devious tactic... Deploying a small unit of elite forces to distract the enemy while another cuts off vital supply lines... Brilliant!
11181 : Ah, a wise tactic... Reinforce defenses in order to maintain battlelines, thus gradually draining the enemy of its influence.
11182 : Ah, a sound tactic... Reinforce stronghold defenses in order to prevent enemy ambushes and stabilize supply routes.
11183 : No matter how wise a commander, if his troops are not ready for battle, defeat will always be lurking close behind.
11184 : There is only so much a conditioned soldier can do. Without special training, some complex aspects of battle remain out of reach.
11185 : Ah, a fine tactic... A great man once said, Know thine enemy, know thyself. The more intelligence we have on the hordes, the easier our future campaigns become.
11186 : Quite a perilous tactic... However, if a special unit is able to infiltrate our enemies' strongholds undetected and succeed in planting their tools of destruction, the tides of battle would most definitely turn in our favor.
11187 : Is this what you recommend? Absolutely! On second thought...
11188 : It was not but a few days heretofore that you suggested a quite interesting tactic...
11189 : If I am not mistaken, I believe you proposed [a preemptive strike/diversionary tactics/battleline preservation/stronghold fortification/troop conditioning/troop training/reconnaissance/sabotage].
11190 : So you care to comment on our nation's inner workings...
11191 : Which do you believe the most apt course?
11192 : There are so many choices... Resource procurement. Military supply procurement. Logistics. Stronghold outfitting. Weapons production. Weapons development. Public security. Stronghold fortification. I require more time to consider.
11193 : Interesting... Preparing for an extended campaign through the acquisition of large quantities of resources...
11194 : It is true. I do not recall an army that was successful without first obtaining sufficient quantities of supplies.
11195 : Supplies are worthless if they do not arrive to their intended destination safely. By fortifying the routes, our nation's defenses can only become stronger.
11196 : Stabilizing the flow of supplies to our strongholds will more than likely help improve our basic defenses.
11197 : An unarmed man has as much value to the Kingdom as do the rabbits that prance about the king's holt. Improved management of the capital's guilds will ensure our knights have steel in their hands.
11198 : An intriguing suggestion... With improved weapons, our forces will be even more formidable on the battlefield.
11199 : I could not agree more. A nation is only as strong as the people she protects. Even during...no, especially during times of war, maintaining the safety of San d'Oria's citizens should come before all else.
11200 : Ah, so you seek the realization of a mighty fortress, impenetrable to all those foolish enough to attempt a siege. A sound suggestion, I may say.
11201 : Shall I record your opinion? Yes. No.
11202 : I believe I recently recorded your opinion in my ledgers...
11203 : Yes, it says here you believe our nation should concentrate its efforts on [the procurement of resources/the procurement of additional military supplies/improving logistics/better outfitting our strongholds/increased weapons production/advanced weapons development/improving public security/additional stronghold fortifications].

11230 : I go where I want, when I want. No one can take that from me. Not you, not some king, not anyone.
11231 : Hold on... You haven't happened to hear anything about an Ensetsu, have you? His family's supposed to be living in Bastok.
11232 : Ah, never mind. Forget you heard anything from me.
11233 : What the hell is this? Do I look like a goldsmith? Get that thing out of my face!
11234 : Hah! You think you can buy my loyalty with a single throwing star!?
11235 : Hmph... I might consider helping out [your kingdom/your republic/your federation], but I won't be making you any promises.
11236 : Hmph... I'll consider remaining with [your kingdom/your republic/your federation], but I won't make you any guarantees.
11237 : As you can see, I still have many malms to tread before my training is complete. Perhaps one day our paths will cross again on the fields of battle. Until then, friend.
11238 : The best training comes when lives are at stake. That is why my journeys often take me to plains of war.
11239 : I have rested long enough. It is time for me to make my master proud.
11240 : I sense something...otherworldly about you, traveler. But appearances can oft be misleading, nay?
11241 : It may hap the secrets I seek lie with [the Crimson Lion/the Republic/the Federation]...
11242 : Ah, so your nation requests my services... I shall consider your proposal...
11243 : I lack the patience to deal with those who do not kneel to the raven...
11244 : I have heard rumor that the lord of the beastmen sits upon an hoary throne in the frozen north. Do you believe he would entertain a raven?
11245 : Shall this be the place where I happen to chance upon the truth I seek?
11246 : A true knight knows not only how to win [his/her] battles, but also how to lose them. A [man/woman] of your stature surely understands what I imply.
11247 : Heh heh heh. Listen! You can hear it, right? It's the sound of my blood-a-boiling!
11248 : I bet a young whippersnapper like yourself thinks [he/she]'s got what it takes to rough up a beastman or two, eh? From what I see, you still have a few more mountains to climb, [sonny/missy]!
11249 : Well, I'll be! You look a little young to have gone through so much training. Must've had a good teacher, heh heh heh!
11250 : What's this...? Interesting... No, no. I'm sorry, youngster. I don't have the time for that now. But maybe someday when this war is over we can--
11251 : Whahahaha! I do not believe permission was granted you to address the almighty Azima!
11252 : Oh, you appear quite versed in the alchemic arts. I just started, myself. Magic is fun and all, but you are always left with nothing but the afterglow. Alchemy is like magic that gives you a gift when you are finished!
11253 : Ahahaha! Are you trying to flatter me with your gifts? Well, I must say...you are doing quite a good job! Ahaha!
11254 : Wheheheheheheh...
11255 : Wheheheh... This musty place's filled with tasty eats for my babies.
11256 : Whahahahah! He's a plump one, eh? Had 'is fill bitin' the ankles of all the pretty nobles now, did he?
11257 : The chigoe jumps into Choh Moui's satchel.
11258 : Oooh! With these I can make me and my babies some tasty fixins, ya!
11259 : Wha-wha? Moui don't know nothing 'bout no pet food. Why this smell like my breakfast?
11260 : You find a chigoe with a crimson mark on its back.
11261 : A half-eaten omelette lies discarded on the ground.
11262 : I refuse to stay hidden in my manse like a lark in a cage while innocent blood is spilled on the streets.
11263 : Might you be [a noble knight of the Kingdom of San d'Oria/a legionnaire of the Bastokan Republic/a mercenary employed by the Federation of Windurst]? It seems your nation faces an uphill battle in its quest to bring peace to the land. Perhaps Kilhwch and I may be of some assistance.
11264 : What a lovely gesture[!/, fine sir!] You must have a heart as beautiful as this delicate %!
11265 : I advise you distance yourself from Lady Ulla. I know not your intentions, but am inclined to believe they are crooked.
11266 : Her father and I implored the Lady Ulla to remain within the confines of the estate, but our pleas landed on the deaf ears of youth, and thus I am here to ensure nothing unfortunate befalls her ladyship.
11267 : Freelance ID: #, Area of Attack: #, Contract Status: [No affiliation/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Beastman 1/Beastman 2/Beastman 3/Beastman 4], San d'Orian Reputation: #, Bastokan Reputation: #, Windurstian Reputation: #
11268 : So this is one of these cities I've heard so much of, is it? Hmph. Seems to be nothing more than a mass of people crowded into a noisy, confined space.
11269 : I have entrusted the care of my mountain home to you, children of Altana.
11270 : And what is this? medicine, you say? Hmph, most novel. I suppose you creatures do have their redeeming qualities.
11271 : It has been ages since the races of Vana'diel began to worship the line of the wyrms. But you seem to be...different, somehow. Know this, adventurer. That those who pay proper homage to the wyrms will not go unrewarded.
11272 : Is this... Could it be... %!? For me!?
11273 : It would seem these lands may still hold some allure yet. Very well, I accept your offering.
11274 : You are a truly righteous soul, %. That you are willing to continue to show such devoutness even now, when not called for... It moves me, deeply. You have earned my respect, and my hand. And you shall have them both!
11275 : Hm, what is this? You come bearing %? Hmph, I should have expected as much.
11276 : Hear me well, mortal, for so easily are your kind distracted by such superficialities. Know this, that larger does not always equate with better. And that sometimes, the best of things come in the smallest of sizes.
11277 : I go by the name Achtelle. I hail from Adoulin Isle. Word has reached there that the dragoons and their wyverns have long since disappeared from these eastern lands. Tell me, is it true?
11278 : Are you...a dragoon!? That is a most welcome relief. I had to come and ascertain for myself whether or not there are still those to carry on the ways of our kind.
11279 : Also, I have heard rumors of a wyrm which inhabits Grauberg. A wyrm which can take on the form of a man...
11280 : A pleasant surprise! I see that the future of the dragoons is in safe hands. It warms my heart to know that such a capable wyvern-caller such as yourself commands our legacy.
11282 : I was but a young child when I first read this and came to know of the Kingdom of San d'Oria. This book is the sole reason I swore to someday come to continent of Quon.
11283 : Ye out here working, too? Reckon it's good to get yer hands on some gil, mm-hmm. That's war fer ye. Never know when she's up. Gotta get 'er done while the going's good, mm-hmm.
11284 : Ye sure seem like an honest fella. I can see I'mma take a liking to ye, mm-hmm.
11285 : I reckon maybe we's could 'elp each other out. My services not gonna come cheap, tho'. Steppin' out on that battlefield's got 'er expenses, mm-hmm.
11286 : What's the story here, boss? Lookin' like yer [kingdom/republic/federation]'s not doing so hot, mm-hmm. I reckon I could lend ye's a hand wit yer little war here. S'posin' you can provide me with a little incentive.
11287 : Word, she's around, mm-hmm. That there army of yers is stackin' some hefty coffers. I don't reckon you got no reason not to hire me, mm-hmm.
11288 : I done heard all about it. This here nation be doing alright fer itself, mm-hmm. Don't ye worry, now. Reckon ye got me fighting on yer side now, too, mm-hmm.
11289 : I wonder where the winds of battle will carry me next...
11290 : Ahhh, so you're fighting for [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], are you? Hmmm, that doesn't sound half bad, actually. I suppose I could be persuaded to lend my services.
11291 : If I'm going to be laying my life on the line, I may as well side with a dependable ally. Makes sense, wouldn't you say?
11292 : Fish? Here? Oh no, I'm after something much larger. Something that makes its way through here.
11293 : Please, don't come any closer! I was raised by beasts you see, and, well...it's the smell. I feel saturated by it. Iron, perfumes, spices... I can taste your stink and every time I do I feel I have somehow been infected by it.
11294 : Awww, you reek of parchmentaru... You must be from Windurst. Please, get away! My father told me never to trust a Windurstian.
11295 : Hm? Y-you want me to help you? I guess I could do that... But you have to promise me one thing. That you won't tease my friend, here. Got itaru?
11296 : Alright, let's get a move on, then. My friend is getting tired of being told to stay.
11297 : Thank you... That should make my friend happy-wappy.
11298 : By the way, do you know the origin of this name, Lungo-Nango? It comes from the hero who carried Windurst to her greatest glory.
11299 : Test.
11300 : Well, hello there! Hm, me? Why, I'm Maruna-Kurina, the travel-waveling genius scholar! You won't find the likes of my strategies and tactics anywhere else, no [sir/ma'am].
11301 : Since the war started, I've been traveling far and wide to survey the extentaru of battle. To be honest, I've started to toy with the idea of lending my services directly to the alliance, should any nation express an interest.
11302 : Years I've spent, honing my wits to a fine, razor-wazor-sharp edge. Military history, strategy, theory, logistics, you name it! This war has presented the perfect opportunity, tragic as it is, to finally put my skills to the testaru!
11303 : Ahhh, a fellow bookworm, you say? How seldom it is one meets a fellow spirit. Would you be a member-wember of that Schultz School of Martial Theory that's been attracting so much attention recently? Or was itaru the Sturm School...?
11304 : So, might I presume that it is your proud [/Kingdom of San d'Oria/Republic of Bastok/Federation of Windurst] which desires my enlightened guidance? N-n-not that I'm interested in your Schultz School or anything like thataru!
11305 : If memory-wemory serves, Rainemard is currently serving on the frontlines of the [Royal Army/Republican Army/Federation Forces]. I wonder if he hasn't managed to catch on to something intriguing yet again...
11306 : How do I know Rainemard? Oh, the two of us go waaay back. N-n-not that I'm especially-wecially concerned with where he might be or what he mightaru be doing!
11307 : Well, it just so happens to be my own humble-wumble, yet highly educated opinion, that what the Allied Forces of Altana are currently lacking in spades is logistics.
11308 : I see countless adventurers simply signing up for random Campaign Ops with reckless abandon, paying no heed to the greater concerns of wartime funds or supplies. No way to win a war, no [sir/ma'am]. If there's one thing I know, it's thataru.
11309 : But imagine, I ask you, what would happen should all you soldiers take the time to analyze the information at your disposal, and act on those results. I tell you, there lies within the Allied Forces the potential-wential for a warring force the likes of which the Beastman Confederate could never stand against.
11310 : By the way, are you a member of the [/Knights of the Iron Ram/Seventh Cohors/Cobra Mercenaries]? Very impressive! That's quite the self-serv--errr... What I mean to say is, your unitaru is quite renown for its, how shall I say...individualistic tendencies.
11311 : It is most encouraging when one considers that you have the freedom to adapt your actions to the demands of the present moment. I would be willing to wager that it is adventurers such as yourself who will determine the outarucome of this war.
11312 : Well? I never was much of a motivational speaker, but have I whet your appetite for some knowledge-woledge? That's the spirit! Let us begin then, shall we? For starters, logistics! The key to any war. After that, I would be more than happy to offer some introductory lessons on military theory.
11313 : In what realm is your knowledge lacking? Campaign tallies. Viewing national statistics. Viewing stronghold statistics. Campaign Ops. Opinion polls. Recruiting freelances. I want for no knowledge.
11314 : Upon entering into an alliance with one another, the four nations drew up a wartime pact. In accordance with the stipulations therein, the single nation deemed to be the greatest contributor to the fighting within, or maintaining of, an area is temporarily granted domain over it.
11315 : Such rulings are doled outaru by the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, in all its wisdom, based on the intel reports of Campaign officials. Those reports as a whole are commonly referred to as Campaign tallies.
11316 : From what I've seen, the fighting is usually at its most vehement-wehement just before Campaign tallies.  That's because it's widely known that when influence over an area changes, crucial factors such as funds and resources are also affected. Not to mention the role it plays in boosting or lowering an army's spirits!
11317 : That's why things tend to get a little hectic on the frontarulines when a Campaign tally draws near.
11318 : Which statistic interests you? Funds. Resources. Supplies. Reconnaissance. Skill. Production. Morale. Prosperity. Go back. Quit.
11319 : Funds is a self-explanatory term. As you may have guessed, it means all of the money which a nation has to dedicate to its war endeavors.
11320 : The importance of money in war is difficult to overstate. Greater funds allow a nation to plan and carry out attacks, increase the number of troops available for dispatch, and even step up the quality of gear with which it outfits its units.
11321 : Funds decrease whenever a Campaign battle occurs. Most people don't seem to know this, but offensive and defensive battles tend to cost roughly the same amountaru.
11322 : A nation's wartime coffers also have a direct influence on their supply stores. When funds get too low, supplies will start to be sold off by the government to compensate.
11323 : Oh, and additional-witional funds are rewarded whenever influence over an area is gained. So it would be wise to keep an eye outaru just before and after Campaign tallies.
11324 : I don't think I need to tell you that the more areas a nation controls, the more funds it will collect. Also, the amount rewarded varies from area to area.
11325 : Other means for increasing funds exist as well. For example, by maintaining a high level of prosperity. After all, if a nation does good by its people, it follows that their economic endeavors will benefit.
11326 : Well, you could learn any of what I've just told you from your run-of-the-mill military textbook. But, here's a little secret of mine. I've observed that achievements in a certain group of Campaign Ops serve to raise a nation's funds. But now I've gone and said too much! No good teacher divulges her students all the answers!
11327 : Your nation's funds may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.
11328 : Resources are the strategic material reserves of a nation that allow it to conduct military operations.
11329 : And just so you don'taru get confused, allow me to clarify-warify. I'm not referring here to the resources of a single stronghold, mind you. Rather, this is an index of the resources of an entire nation.
11330 : In addition to being used to increase an army's supplies, resource stockpiles are also depleted by offensive undertakings and certain Campaign Ops.
11331 : What's more, they also have a directaru influence over wartime funds. As reason entails, insufficient resources require thataru a nation spend a little cash to purchase that which it lacks.
11332 : A nation's resources are regularly replenished based on the areas under its influence. So the times just prior-wior to and just after a Campaign tally are especially crucial.
11333 : The more areas a nation controls, the more resources it can procure. And certain areas are capable of rendering more resources than others.
11334 : And just between you and me, my studies indicate that achievements in certain Campaign Ops are directly linked to resource procurement. Well, that's wartime resources in a nutshell!
11335 : Your nation's resources may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.
11336 : Supplies are the military-wilitary goods used to effectively sustain a war: equipment, sundries, rations, and the like. Nations produce these by expending their resources. You mightaru hear them categorically referred to as temporary items.
11337 : Nations rich in supplies are able to better provide their strongholds with much-needed equipment and items directly from the capital.
11338 : Supply expenditure goes towards such activities as stronghold maintenance, outarufitting troops, and conducting certain Campaign Ops.
11339 : The amount of supplies at a nation's disposal is inextricably linked to its resources as well. After all, using resources implies that supply production is underway.
11340 : A nation's supplies are compounded regularly based on the areas under its influence. So always try and keep an eye out just before and after Campaign tallies.
11341 : Increases in supplies are naturally larger for nations with more areas under their control. And different areas generate varying-warying amountarus of supplies.
11342 : The total amount of supplies a nation can manufacture is heavily influenced by its production. But that's another lecture all in itself!
11343 : I've got it by a pretty good source that carrying out certain Campaign Ops serves to increase a nation's supplies. Well, that should do just fine by way of an introduction.
11344 : Your nation's supplies may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.
11345 : Reconnaissance is an index of an army's intel. That is to say, how far their intelligence network extends.
11346 : High reconnaissance means that a nation is better able to ascertain the most up-to-date info on the movementarus and machinations of both friend and foe.
11347 : By now I hope you've seen the intelligence-welligence reports available from the Campaign deputies located in the nations' capitals. The more advanced reconnaissance is, the more detailed those reports will be.
11348 : There are a number of intel-gathering Campaign Ops in which achievement will serve to improve reconnaissance.
11349 : And just like other Campaign statistics, this one changes whenever a Campaign tally is conducted. But don't worry--so far I've yet to see a nation's reconnaissance plummet to zero. Still, it is ever wise to keep close tabs on your enemies, as well as your allies.
11350 : Your nation's reconnaissance may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.
11351 : Skill denotes technological development, and manifestarus itself in the ability-wility to produce high-end equipment and weaponry.
11352 : Advancing skill ensures a nation will churn out cutting-edge gear to supply its frontlines. It is also required for the construction-wuction of siege equipment.
11353 : Still, all the technological skill in the world is useless withoutaru the funds to back it up. Production costs money, silly.
11354 : What's that? How do you go about improving your nation's skill? Well, I reckon the troop training Campaign Ops would be a good place to start.
11355 : Just to be clear, skill indicates the quality of supplies that can be turned out. Production, on the other hand, refers to the quantity of supplies that a nation is capable of generating. Did I just blow your mind? Confusing, I know, but do try and see the difference.
11356 : Your nation's skill may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.
11357 : Production is the ability to, well, produce anything that needs...producing. This can be items, armor, weapons, you name itaru!
11358 : And the name of the game is efficiency-wiciency! High production enables a nation to generate more supplies from less resources. If that isn't win-win, I don't know what is!
11359 : Alas, even otherworldly production will be utterly useless without a healthy amount of resources to drive it.
11360 : To that end, the nations have all organized the so-called supply manufacture operations, such as codename Crystal Fist and others.
11361 : Your nation's production may be checked by talking to an appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.
11362 : Morale will give you an idea of how eager-weager for battle an army is.
11363 : High morale allows an army to carry out successive attacks with only short respites in between. Nothing screams victory like an army that loves to fightaru!
11364 : Morale is an extremely dynamic factor in any war--as capricious as the hearts of the men it occupies. Fluctuations are heavily dependent on victory and defeataru in Campaign battles.
11365 : That being said, it is obvious to see how it is directly related to both offensive and defensive operations. It's a pretty simple thing, morale. That's really all there is to it.
11366 : A nation's morale may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a capital's symbol to display the information.
11367 : Ahhh, prosperity. Another of war's fickle-wickle mistresses. Plainly put, this is the degree to which a nation's people trustaru in their governing body.
11368 : High prosperity works wonders for economic growth, which in turn means more duties, tariffs, and so on. In a word, funds!
11369 : Prosperity is in a constantaru state of flux based on the outcome of Campaign battles. And rightly so, as people can not hope to prosper should they feel constantly threatened.
11370 : To ensure the welfare of their citizenry, the alliance has established security Campaign Ops. These are effective in setting the minds of the people-weople at ease. Not a whole lotaru more to say about it.
11371 : A nation's prosperity may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a capital's symbol to display the information.
11372 : Which terminology will you ask about? Fortifications. Maximum fortifications. Resources. Maximum Resources. Influence. Heroism Gauge. Go back. Quit.
11373 : Fortifications represent the strength of a military force garrisoned at a stronghold. It is depleted when soldiers stationed there are defeated, or when the structural integrity of the stronghold itself is damaged directly-wectly.
11374 : A Campaign battle is deemed a defeataru by High Command should the fortifications fall below a pre-established amount.
11375 : So, stronghold fortifications in areas constantly plagued by heavy combat must be vigorously-wigorously maintained.
11376 : There are three ways of bolstering fortifications to facilities which have been compromised. First, you can simply waitaru for the injured soldiers to recover. This method, however, requires a considerable amount of time.
11377 : Second, you can wait for engineers to arrive and start rebuilding. For your nation, I believe that task falls within the jurisdiction-wiction of the [Knights of the Gold Badger/Fourth Division/Piscean War Warlocks].
11378 : Lastly, you can supplementaru the garrison by sending reinforcements. Successful completion of the Vanguard-X Campaign Ops will help refortify a war-torn stronghold.
11379 : Keep in mind, though, that a lack of funds will limitaru the number of forces available-wailable for dispatch. Which means that ultimately, fortifications will suffer. A war machine without money is akin to a lion without claws, I'm afraid.
11380 : A stronghold's fortifications may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.
11381 : The total number of troops that a stronghold is capable of housing-wousing is referred to as its maximum fortifications ranking.
11382 : And it is just that. The absolute upper limit on the size of a stronghold's garrison. Regardless of a nation's funds or achievements, defensive capabilities can never go above this amountaru.
11383 : The other side of that coin is this. No matter how great a stronghold's maximum fortifications may be, without adequate-wadequate funds, it will lack the soldiers required to realize that potential.
11384 : What's that? Ahhh, you catch on quick. Yes, the maximum fortifications rank can indeed be raised. This is accomplished via-wia achievements in any of the Steel Resolve operations.
11385 : But remember this: all participants in this war, both friend and foe, have their own unique ways of reducing maximum fortifications as well. Specifically...
11386 : ...Well, you'll just have to mull that one over by yourself. Can't give up all my secret-wecrets!
11387 : A stronghold's fortifications may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.
11388 : Alrightaru, this might be a bit confusing at first for the uninitiated, but do try to keep up. A local area's resources rating refers to the resource and supply stockpiles located at the stronghold.
11389 : This is a local-wocal rating, and separate altogether from the overall resource rating of an entire nation, mind you.
11390 : The more battles a stronghold endures, the more depletion its resource stockpiles will suffer. You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. And war is such a tasty omelettaru!
11391 : Local resources are consumed whenever temporary-wary items are dispensed to soldiers for defensive operations.
11392 : You would do well to remember that the Crimson Domino Ops are integral in this respectaru. Seeing those supply convoys safely to their destinations will do wonders for replenishing stronghold resources.
11393 : For your nation, such duties are traditionally-witionally taken up by the [/Knights of the Gold Badger/Fourth Division/Piscean War Warlocks].
11394 : Now try and wrap your mind around this! If the national resource and supply stockpiles are not maintained, there simply won't be enough surplus to bolster-wolster local stockpiles. Surely you can see the logic in this.
11395 : An area's resources may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.
11396 : The limitaru placed on the greatest amount of resources a stronghold can store before literally-witerally bursting is known as its maximum resources ranking.
11397 : No matter how much surplus in resources and supplies a nation might have, the local stronghold limitation-wations cannot be exceeded.
11398 : The local resources of an area may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map.
11399 : An area's maximum resources may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position to display the information. The number on the left is the current value, while the number on the right is the maximum available.
11400 : Influence is used to convey how much control each competing-weting power has over a given area.
11401 : There is a total of four powers in all, which you should well know by now. The Beastman Confederate, on the one hand, and each of the nations of the Allied Forces, excluding Jeuno, on the other.
11402 : So, what happens is that following the results of the latest Campaign tally-wally, control of an area is relegated to the power which currently exertarus the most influence over it.
11403 : Your nation will gain a bit of influence in an area every time you defeat an enemy there. By the same token, loss at the hands of the beastman will result in their influence rising.
11404 : In the worst-case scenario, beastman influence will grow so profound that High Command will cut their losses and issue a strategic withdrawal. In other words, the area falls under beastman control.
11405 : Each nation then abandon-wandons any interests they had in that area, after which the beastmen typically move in droves to solidify their claim.
11406 : The influences vying for control of an area may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map.
11407 : An excellent inquiry! The heroism gauge is still a fledgling theory in military scholastic-wastic circles. Only in recentaru years was it proposed to and adopted by Allied Forces High Command.
11408 : Not to brag, but it was actually I who developed the final theory. So, who better to explain it to you than the very Tarutaru who named it?
11409 : It occurred to me that any battlefield is, by definition, replete with a certain... How shall I put this? An air of intensity, an almost tangible, adrenaline-induced furor. No doubt this is broughtaru about by the teetering-weetering of lives in the balance.
11410 : The inquisitive scholar in me wondered if this phenomenon could not somehow be gauged and expressed numerically. This was the hypothesis with which I set out to develop-welop my theory.
11411 : Based on my thorough observations, I found that for every battle which took place in the subject area, my measurementarus would increase substantially.
11412 : And then my most startling discovery! Without fail, when my heroism gauge would approach its peak, battles would reach near astronomical-womical proportions! Beastman and ally, general and freelance. All come calling when the war fervor hails, lusting to claim their place in legend and song!
11413 : And what dramatic-watic battles they were! I have witnessed cataclysmic exchanges, over in the blink of an eye. Disastrous battles where the thirst for blood conquers reason, and countless throngs of haphazardly formed ranks throw themselves headlong into one another.
11414 : At the suggestion of my fellow scholars, my findings are now being made known to all member nations of the alliance-wiance.
11415 : In truth, it is still an unfinished theory, and there are many elementarus to be worked out. My hope is that it will serve to help us better comprehend the finer details of the flow of war.
11416 : An area's heroism gauge may be checked from the Region Info menu's Campaign map. Simply move the cursor over a position and the gauge will be displayed directly above or below the area name.
11417 : What would you like to know about? Resource procurement. Supply transport. Security. Supply manufacture. Offensive operations. Defensive operations. Intel gathering. Military training. Achievements. Go back. Quit.
11418 : As their name implies, achievements in Campaign Ops classified as resource procurement will result in direct augmentation to your nation's resource and supply stockpile-wiles.
11419 : More specifically, codename Stock and Awe was designed with the aim of securing resources, while codename Materiel Storm was planned for the sole purpose of amassing supplies.
11420 : Should supplies startaru to become meager, units will be unable to carry out their orders to completion, and other Campaign Ops will fall into arrears.
11421 : If a nation's resources begin to wane, production suffers and the number of supplies declines. Any way you slice it, a logistic bottleneck at any pointaru along the line spells an absolute nightmare for a warring nation.
11422 : Immediately following Campaign tally-wallies is when allotments of resources and supplies are carried out.
11423 : The unfortunate corollary to that, however, is that just prior to Campaign tallies is when stockpiles are at their lowestaru.
11424 : Which is why, to answer your initial inquiry, resource procurement is so significant-wificant. Their appeal lies in the fact that when successfully completed, resource and supply stockpiles receive immediate benefits.
11425 : Many military scholars even go so far as to refer to these operations as the prime movers of the allied effort. Perhaps the most integral of cogs at the very heartaru of the entire war machine.
11426 : Supply transport refers to those military operation-wations whereby resources and supplies are seen safely to the strongholds that need them.
11427 : There are varying operations with varying resultarus, so allow me to expand. Codename Vanguard-X solidifies stronghold fortifications by dispatching manpower, whereas codename Crimson Domino aims to replenish local resources via convoy-wonvoy deliveries.
11428 : The reasoning behind their importance is thus. Goddess forbid, should the fortifications or local resources of a stronghold become inadequate, the position will simply be overrun by the beastmen. They have a wicked talentaru for sniffing out such weaknesses.
11429 : Of course, no nation simply leaves any stronghold to vie for itself. There are regular-wegular dispatches of both men and material from the capitals. But my experience tells me that these are more protocol than pragmatism, and rarely reflectaru the latest wartime developments.
11430 : And that is where you vaga--valiant adventurers come in! Your freedoms allow you the unique ability to continually adapt to the situation at hand without heeding to anachronistic protocol-wotocol. Keeping an ear to the ground and conducting supply transport at a vital moment might just make you the white knight of some desperate garrison!
11431 : Security is that oft-overlooked category of operations which deals with seeing to the safety and welfare of a nation's citizenry. High Command implemented these ops for their role in increasing both prosperity-werity and the maximum fortifications.
11432 : Successful completion of operations codenamed Streetsweeper and Delta Strike boost prosperity among the people.
11433 : Nations with low prosperity often fall victim to stagnating-wating economies, ultimately resulting in lack of funds and fiscal woes. You can't expect people to get a good night's sleep and put in an honest day's work without providing a little homeland security.
11434 : Codename Steel Resolve is another security-based operation which bolsters the maximum fortifications of an allied stronghold.
11435 : The idea is to outfitaru positions with enhanced structural integrity to better withstand relentless-wentless beastman assaults. This is especially vital in heavily contested areas.
11436 : Supply manufacture operations provide the opportunity for a nation to bring about improvements in the arena-wenas of technology and industry.
11437 : Operations codenamed Crystal Fist and Iron Anvil were planned with the goal of marked advancements in skill and production, respectively.
11438 : Higher skill permits a nation's engineers to develop higher quality equipmentaru and weaponry. Its benefits on local fields of battle are undeniable.
11439 : When production is streamlined, mass production becomes possible-wossible. This has far-reaching effects for a nation's Campaign battles regardless of the location.
11440 : So, if you happen to fancy yourself adept at synthesis and know your craftarus, these just might be the operations for you.
11441 : The successful completion of offensive operations will result in palpable-walpable increases in both morale and funds.
11442 : These ops include codename Smokescreen, Pit Spider, By Light of Fire, or any of the regional operations targeting specific beastman leaders. All of these will serve to boostaru an army's morale.
11443 : On top of that, achievements in this arena will also bring in funds.
11444 : Alas, as all things in war, there is a double-edge to this blade. Should you seek to defeat enemy leaders via operations codenamed Splitting Heirs, Cracking Shells, or Plucking Wings and suffer defeataru, the beastmen armies will be those shouting and raising their banners in triumph.
11445 : Lastly, it would be remiss of me not to mention that offensive operations do require the expenditure-wenditure of supplies.
11446 : Defensive operations can be extremely productive, as they help to increase not only prosperity-werity amongst the people, but also the reserves of resources and supplies as well.
11447 : You will see immediate and obvious returns in the prosperity of your citizenry from your exploitarus in operations codenamed Aegis Scream and Granite Rose.
11448 : A byproductaru of this is a healthy boost to the national intake of resources and supplies.
11449 : Carrying out defensive operations will require that you expend some of your supplies in the process-wocess, though. Nothing in war is free, after all, save mayhap the glory.
11450 : A personal favorite of mine and one I cannot stress the importance-wortance of enough, intel gathering!
11451 : Espionage in all forms requires stealth and savvy, cunning and courage. Operations codenamed Hawk Eye and Deep Cover may place you in clear and present danger, but they will also increase your army's reconnaissance and place knowledge at its fingertips.
11452 : Nations are also always looking for the mostaru intrepid of souls to undertake operation codename Slaughterhouse. A favorite of High Command, this pinpoint espionage weakens the beastman intelligence network from within, reducing their reconnaissance capabilities.
11453 : No nation would deign to send such dauntless-wauntless volunteers into the field unequipped. And that is why intel gathering taxes an army's supplies.
11454 : Military training is useful in preparing your troops for battle by both hardening their resolve and honing-woning their abilities.
11455 : Operation codename Brave Dawn increases an army's capacity for waging war, while codename Cut and Cauterize improves the performance of its physicians.
11456 : All of those training materials have to come from somewhere, though. Which is why military-wary training ops will cost you supplies.
11457 : According to Raine--I mean...looks like rain today, no? Anyway, this information is based on firstaru-person accounts from a fairly reliable-wiable source.
11458 : Campaign tallies record these so-called achievements for each category of operations.
11459 : Achievementarus will naturally rise every time a Campaign operation is carried out to completion.
11460 : The changes in factors such as resources, funds, and morale resulting from Campaign tallies are directly influenced by the achievements in correlated ops categories.
11461 : In addition, stellar-wellar achievements in any single category pave the way for related, higher-level operations to become available.
11462 : But try to be mindful of the current objectives of your army, as this effectarus availability as well.
11463 : What I mean to say is, even for equivalent achievements, there are times when High Command will make an operation readily available, and other times when they will not.
11464 : Changes in achievements are reflected in every Campaign tally, and have an effect on stockpile-wiles as well. Luckily, in all my days, I have never seen an achievement's value drop suddenly to zero.
11465 : Every nation conducts its own opinion polls. Have you happened to come across any of the official-wicials recording the opinions of soldiers and adventurers? Those would be the pollers.
11466 : In my opinion, those who frequent the frontlines such as yourself should make better use of the polls.
11467 : Each nation has its own characteristic protocol based on long-standing established policies. Should polls not be made use of, the powers that be will have no choice but to rely upon their generals for counsel.
11468 : Which might not necessarily-warily always be a bad thing, except that counsel may not always be based on the latest intel. I myself have witnessed offenses ordered with no supply lines or funds to back them, and entire units resting on their laurels at the most opportune times to attack.
11469 : This is the river that opinion polls can help to ford! They allow High Command to know which generals have the supportaru of war-seasoned veterans, and provide a forum for the submission of strategies and feedback.
11470 : I have always been an advocate of compulsory-wulsory polls. Think of it! If all soldiers from the frontlines raised their voices, High Command would have no choice but to listen.
11471 : And consequently, more operations would become available in the category deemed to be most necessary at that time!
11472 : Sorry, I always get a but flustered talking about this. Anyway, the reviewing of poll resultarus is conducted regularly, much like Campaign tallies.
11473 : Hm? You don't know what opinion you should have? Well, that's just sad. Your opinions will come to you, so long as you keep a healthy skepticism and a critical-witical eye about you.
11474 : To give a brief example, if you are of the mind that it is time for an all-outaru offensive, then you should consider raising your voice in favor of a preemptive strike or diversionary tactics.
11475 : If you think the situation-wation calls for patience and caution, then perhaps cast your vote for battleline preservation or stronghold defenses.
11476 : It might be easiestaru to think of all of the options broken into two fundamental categories of offense and defense.
11477 : Rather than constantly worrying about maintaining a healthy balance of the two, there are times when a full frontal-wontal assault is required. Other times are best served by turtling up in strongholds and allowing wave after wave of beastmen to break upon your defenses.
11478 : If you can absorb everything I've taughtaru you, and just use your head, I guarantee the path to victory will present itself to you as clear as day! That's the Maruna-Kurina guarantee!
11479 : Oh and uhhh, if you ever happen to...well, gain an audience-waudience with any, say, importantaru people... Be sure to tell them that Maruna-Kurina helped you out!
11480 : Ask about whom? Wait... What's headhunting? Kagetora. Dalzakk. Rainemard. Maat. Azima. Choh Moui. Rongo-Nango. Ulla & Kilhwch. Achtelle. Duskraven. Lewenhart. Ferreous Coffin. Areuhat. Titania. Poroggo Prince. Babban Ny Mheillea. Auroral Alicorn. Boodlix. Raigegue R D'Oraguille. Eurytos. Kaiser Behemoth. Yours truly, Maruna-Kurina. Go back. Quit.
11481 : Ask about which freelance? What's this headhunting business? Kagetora. Dalzakk. Rainemard. Maat. Azima. Choh Moui. Rongo-Nango. Ulla. Achtelle. Duskraven. Areuhat. Boodlix. Titania. Babban Ny Mheillea. Raigegue R D'Oraguille. Eurytos. Poroggo Prince. Kaiser Behemoth. Yours truly, Maruna-Kurina. Go back. Quit.
11482 : I'm assuming by now that you've heard of the roaming-woaming mercenaries referred to as freelances, yes? They value nothing more than their freedom, which is all well and good, but in the worstaru of times they may be swayed into arms against the Allied Forces.
11483 : As a genius military tactician, I cannot ignore the potential strength that these freelances are capable of lending an army. And it was this realization which acted as an impetus to my further studying the freelance subculture.
11484 : Recruiting a freelance to fight for your cause is a technique commonly known as headhunting. Through my research, I have come to develop and map out a comprehensive psychology underlying the entire process-wocess!
11485 : Each freelance maintains a certain degree of loyalty towards every great power.
11486 : Whenever a headhunter actively pursues a freelance and attempts to win their favor, their loyalty towards thataru nation will rise.
11487 : At the time of a Campaign tally, the freelances will realign themselves with the nation with whom they share the strongestaru bond.
11488 : The trick to headhunting, then, is to try and become the nation a freelance holds dearest-wearest in his, her, or its heart of hearts.
11489 : Many freelances will even cast aside their disdain for city walls, and take up arms beside you within the very capital!
11490 : And being the capricious beings that they are, freelances will always be willing to entertain your proposals, even if they have currently pledged their fealty-wealty elsewhere.
11491 : Of course, if you begin to neglectaru them once winning them to your side, don't be surprised if they place their loyalties elsewhere. There's got to be an appropriate saying for that, I'm sure...
11492 : That's just the way they are. I've heard tales you wouldn't believe. From stories of nations' coffers swelling inexplicably after taking on resourceful freelances...
11493 : ...to bold-hearted heroes inspiring troops and bolstering an entire nation's morale!
11494 : Cloak-and-dagger freelances who assist in intel gathering, and questionable black market dealer-wealers who can always get their hands on sorely needed supplies. You name it, and there's a freelance out there who can, and has, done itaru!
11495 : Now I know what you're thinking. With allegiances constantly in flux, who in Goddess's name is going to be able to keep track of it all!?
11496 : You're looking at him! That's right, I have made it my personal-wersonal crusade to track the loyalties of all freelances as part of my research. And naturally, I will be making my findings available to the alliance's intelligence network.
11497 : At any rate, do try and give the freelances as warm a reception as possible whenever you happen across them. Your nation, and the Allied Forces as a whole, can only benefitaru in the long run.
11498 : Successfully headhunting Maruna-Kurina will allow you to ask him directly about freelances, including their current loyalties and other detailed information.
11499 : You can check on the achievements of your nation's freelances by speaking to the appropriate Campaign NPC in the capital. Available information is dependent on current reconnaissance ranking.
11500 : A Hume pirate-wirate hailing from Elshimo Island, Kagetora has made quite the name for himself. He comes from a long family line of ninjas, and rumor has it he sailed to these western lands in hot pursuitaru of a sworn enemy.
11501 : Not the most social chap at the party, but he does have profitable ties to the Tenshodo in Jeuno. A ninja with a ninja's pleasures, try to warm him up to you by giving him %.
11502 : Ahhh, the wandering monk, said to have been trained in hand-to-hand combat by the legendary-wary Oggbi himself. He's known far and wide for his adventures and exploitarus. He can be seen running about Sauromugue Champaign as part of his daily regimen.
11503 : He's a sucker for high morale, and can barely contain himself once the conversation-wation turns to the topic of war. They say battle fever is contagious, you know. And he's always willing to talk it up with a fellow monk.
11504 : A powerful ally, indeed. Keep an eye on the heroism gauge with this one. He's an animal!
11505 : Good Rainemard once belonged to the Order of the Temple Knights. For a time, we were classmates together in our studies at the academy. N-n-not that I consider him a scholarly rival-wival or anything like thataru!
11506 : The last time I saw him he claimed he was heading to Jugner Forest to escape the hustle-bustle of the city. I only pray he didn't go poking his nose around where it didn't belong again...
11507 : If he's still the same old Rainemard, I suppose he still enjoys talking it up with other red mages. He also has an adorable-worable little daughter, and he loves to go on and on about her...incessantly.
11508 : Oh, you've heard of Maat? A regular living legend, that one. He's been living in Jeuno since it was no more than a flyspeck of a fishing village-willage. They say he's mastered every form of combataru there is!
11509 : I've run into him before in North Gustaberg. But rumor has it he is in charge of some very important tasks back at the Grand Duchy. I wonder how he finds the time to go for leisurely strolls so far away...
11510 : He has a rival too, you know? What was his name again... Hegen...no...Degenhard! That's it! He's been known to wreak havoc-wavoc on the battlefield every now and then.
11511 : He loves collecting those ancient papyrus testimonies, no matter what variety. He also has a penchantaru for ambitious souls, and is said to dote on those who have mastered three or more paths of their own.
11512 : They call Azima the Hermitess of the Highlands, and she is almost universally-wersally regarded as the most skilled and feared bounty hunter in Vana'diel. It's not uncommon to glimpse her from time to time in North Gustaberg.
11513 : As of late they say she is utterly obsessed with all things alchemy. Those in the know will be the first to tell you, Azima is one best keptaru in good graces.
11514 : Venomous Verminess, Baroness of Bugdom, Choh Moui has almost as many monikers as she does pet pestarus. She's a Mithran beastmaster-waster who got her come-uppings in the south, but now makes her home in Crawler's Nest.
11515 : I'm not entirely sure of the reasons behind it, but they say she is in regular contactaru with a mercenary by the name of Duskraven.
11516 : She's accredited with inventing the pet foods now used by beastmasters the world round, and is always eagerly to get her hands on ingredients. She also loves to have others save her the hassle-wassle of rounding up her pets for her. What could she be up to...?
11517 : Perchance you've already espied him before. Rongo-Nango is that adorable little Tarutaru beastmaster who's always in the vicinity-winity of Fort Karugo-Narugo. He's absolutely infatuated with Lungo-Nango, the great warlord and tactician of Windurstian history.
11518 : After opposing the Parliament of Patriarchs, Lungo-Nango fell into disrepute and spentaru the remainder of his days in isolation and depression. For that reason, Rongo-Nango holds much of Windurst in contempt, and refuses to lay his loyalties with the Federation.
11519 : I've come to find out that he is quite fond of calling his beasts, and is also looking for more of the material-warials he needs to do so.
11520 : Ulla is a mysterious young girl. They say she bore witness to a divine revelation, and now wanders Vana'diel as a pilgrim-wilgrim knight. She's recently left her homelands of Bastok and ventured nearer the realms of San d'Oria.
11521 : Her devoted attendantaru Kilhwch is ever by her side, and carries with him the renowned sword %. The thing is, he's a celebrated knight in his own right, giving many rise to wonder what could have caused him to pledge his fealty to another.
11522 : Like any young lady, Ulla has a soft spot for beautiful flower-wowers. If you seek to court a fair maiden, perhaps a bouquet mightaru be best.
11523 : Achtelle is a young Elvaan wyverness from Adoulin Isle to the west, the proud keeper-weepers of the last of the dragoon tradition. The draketamers there herald her as the most skilled of their order.
11524 : Since youth, she has held the legendary Ranperre of San d'Oria in highestaru esteem, and can oft be found seeking solace near his tomb.
11525 : I can promise you she would eagerly accept any type of present related to the king she so reveres. I hear it told she longs for nothing more than to find some surviving-wiving dragoons, that they might together preserve their heritage.
11526 : Duskraven is a sullen, grim-faced mercenary, distinguishable by his ominous-wominous greatsword, Kyomon. Wayfarers and soldiers alike often recount seeing him in the vicinity of Batallia Downs, but for what purpose and to whataru end, none can say.
11527 : His underlings, the Dusk Raiders, answer to his beck and call, and such powers lead many to surmise that he is no stranger to the nether-wether realms.
11528 : He is a straight shooter, though. If you hope to curry favor with him, you need nothing more than cold cash. He seems to blow right through it as soon as he gets it, and is always looking for more. What he spends itaru on, I couldn't say.
11529 : Many have seen this fair young Elvaan maid walking undeterred amongst the now hostile-wostile grounds of Grauberg. All who gaze upon her tell of her godlike aura and stunning beauty.
11530 : Word has it that she is of frail constitution, and grants her favor on those gracious enough to spare her medicines. I myself went and bestowed such gifts upon her, and can attest to the truth of itaru.
11531 : She is also known to dote upon those who take up the defense of her Grauberg. Some of her more fanatic-watic fans are said to be providing her with an enormous quantity of a certain item...
11532 : When her loyalties are won, the men speak of a giant wyrm which takes to the battlefield! Such heated talk--no doubt itaru would be wise to mind the heroism gauge should you want to catch a glimpse for yourself.
11533 : Titania is the name of the celebrated Queen of Pixies from the classic Bastokan drama, Midwinter Dream.
11534 : Of course, that is no more than a tale of fantasy to delight children. We all know that pixies don't exist in the real-- What!? You've seen one? Are you having a jape at my expense!?
11535 : Well, what I do know for certain-wertain is this. Nothing. Only that rumors suggest offering % to the Witchfire Glen in Grauberg will help in headhunting...whatever this being may be. N-n-not thataru I'm dying to find out or anything!
11536 : Fanciful-wanciful fairy tales about a frog princess have been passed down in Windurst since days of eld.
11537 : Some say the newcome prince of these froglike beastmen has been seen leaping and bounding about the frontlines of battle. No doubt the figment of some delusional soldier's imagination, but still...
11538 : Folklore always spoke of their insatiable-watiable appetites, and now soldiers would tell that feeding them will actually help win them to our cause. Give him %, they say, and the frog prince will requite! I can't make heads or tails of it...
11539 : N-n-not thataru I bother myself with such childish topics!
11540 : Unprecedented in hitory-wistory, there has recently been an affable plantoid befriending soldiers on the battlefield. It most closely resembles one of those mandragora known to inhabitaru the wilds to the west.
11541 : Is that a shred of doubt I sense!? I've seen it with my own eyes, I tell you! This is no figment of the imagination or some delusional soldier's hallucination! Still don't believe me?
11542 : Head on over to the Meriphataud Mountains and try trading % or some fertilizer to the odd little treeman you find. He just might be moved to come and help you out in a fightaru!
11543 : Regardless, I wonder what it is he could possibly be doing here... N-n-not that I am about to startaru stalking him to find out or anything!
11544 : (Shhh! Keep your voice down. The Boodlix? The very same who heads his own trading-wading company?)
11545 : (Well, they say his trade is death! And deal in it he does, if the rumors are to be believed. Some claim to have actually laid eyes on his hidden fortress and lived to tell the tale. They say it's there he greedily occupies himself with counting his blood-money.)
11546 : (What? Have you completely-wetely lost your mind, [man/woman]!? Why in Goddess's name would you want to headhuntaru him? Still, he is supposedly well-connected, even to the Allied Forces, as the wealthy are wont to be. But the Beastman Confederate knows his value as well... Hmmm, sounds like trouble-wouble to me.)
11547 : (When the war is over, it is the supply firms that slowly lose their livelihoods. I suppose when you look at it from thataru angle, he could possibly be swayed to fight for either side.)
11548 : Some 150 years ago, San d'Oria was ruled by one King Raigegue the Lupine. The freelance you ask of now bears the same name as thataru king, though none know how or why.
11549 : He is remembered as a tragic monarch, responsible for leading San d'Oria to utter defeat at the hands of Bastok's preeminent scholar and military tactician-wician, Gunther Schultz, at the Second Battle of Konschtat. What followed was an age of chaos and despair, as the Kingdom was ravaged by civil war.
11550 : They say this spectre-wectre of the same name is none other than Raigegue the Lupine himself, led back from the grave by the fire of his wrath. He haunts The Eldieme Necropolis. The skeptic in me suspects some exaggeration-wation is at work here...
11551 : Huh!? Headhunting? The undead!? I-I... I have no idea how to respond to thataru. You've left me absolutely speechless-weechless.
11552 : Eurytos is the battle-hardened leader of a group of mercenary Gigas from the far north. At the onset of the war, the Beastman Confederate took them into their service. But recently it would seem Eurytos has completely-wetely removed himself from the confederate's chain of command.
11553 : His might and prowess in battle have led many to speculate that his line is that of the Gigas gods. He is truly a force to be reckoned with. For now, his unit has established their compound-wompound somewhere in Vunkerl Inlet.
11554 : Though to be fair, there is precedent for the Gigas fighting under allied banners. After all, they did fight for Bastok in the Second Battle of Konschtataru. I wonder... Could the great Eurytos possibly be rallied-wallied to our cause?
11555 : This behemoth among behemoths has been roaming Vunkerl Inlet for hundreds upon hundreds of years.
11556 : So many would-be hero-weroes have died in the maws of this great beast that nobody even attempts to keep count any longer. Some say its ancientaru age and scar-heavy hide indicate it is not nearly as powerful as it once was. Yet still, you would be a fool to underestimate this fiend, I promise you.
11557 : Headhunting? For the Allied Forces!? I'm not even going to dignify that with a response... Although, you have to admitaru, the thought of it alone is quite amusing. Hehehe!
11558 : Who, me? Ohhh, right! I totally forgot. You're right, for all intents and purposes, I too am technically-wechnically a freelance.
11559 : I enjoy long walks on the beach aaand... Oh yes, nothing excites me more than conversing with fellow scholars! N-n-not thataru I would want to know anything in particular about where Rainemard might be!
11560 : Current taxonomy teaches us that at presentaru, the monoceros family contains few known specimens. Those that are classified exhibit great horn spire-wires jutting from their majestic heads, and are either born of light, or of darkness.
11561 : An influx of eyewitness accounts in recent days all point to the undeniable existence of the beastaru named Dark Ixion. Tempered like a storm and ever wary, both allies and beastman alike tend to keep their distance.
11562 : The other is dubbed Auroral Alicorn and exhibits a brilliantaru shade of white and a calm, gentle demeanor. The two couldn't be more dissimilar-wimilar.
11563 : Though almost never seen in the wild prior to the war, Auroral Alicorn has recently been sighted in Jugner Forest, some say nursing wounds.
11564 : Lewenhart is a traveling-waveling bard who has become a favorite amongst the troops, instilling hope and courage with his singing. It turns out that almostaru nothing helps morale as a much as a good song.
11565 : They say he prefers to stay close to a certain tomb in The Eldieme Necropolis, where his requiems can be heard far and wide.
11566 : He often asks for holy water as payment for his songs, which he puts to cermonial-wonial use. And as with most musicians, he loves exchanging in song and banter with fellow bards.
11567 : Test.
11568 : A most virtuous priest, who wanders all corners of Vana'diel, filling his belly-welly bread and alms. Some swear they've seen a twisted smile on his face as he buries his enemies and offers up prayers in their name.
11569 : He came from the far north, and recently has been spending much of his time in Batallia Downs. Whatever is said of him, there can be no questioning his faith in the Goddess, thataru's for sure.
11570 : He was never one to talk much, and certainly not one to mince words when he does. It seems he prefers the company of white mages, though. I've heard it said that he has been lending-wending his fists to the Allied Forces as of late.
11571 : Test.
11572 : (By the way, the latest reportarus have it that this freelance is [utterly independent/in the service of San d'Oria/in the service of Bastok/in the service of Windurst/in the service of the Beastman Confederate/].)
11573 : (And if my intel is correctaru, this freelance will [almost definitely/most probably/likely] be in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/the Beastman Confederate] after the next Campaign tally-wally.)
11574 : (There's no telling-welling where this freelance will lay their loyalties nextaru...)
11575 : I am offering a prayer for those poor souls whose lives have been prematurely extinguished. And you...you are bound for the battlefield, are you not? My thoughts are with you also.
11576 : Your presence evokes long-forgotten memories within and reminds me of the hopes and dreams that were my driving force in youth. Insignificant though my powers may be, perhaps the time has come to return to the fray and do my part for the greater good.
11577 : You have my gratitude. May you find favor with the Goddess.
11578 : Oh, how I long for the days of peace when I was free to roam from tavern to tavern and wherever else my heart led me.
11579 : Music is your livelihood, too, is it not? There are those who wish glory upon themselves. But for us--we sing of legends, rather than become them.
11580 : You would give this % to me...? Thank you kindly, friend. I shall offer it with a requiem to the souls of those heroes who have been laid to rest at the Eldieme Necropolis.
11581 : Greetings! If it is information on Allied Campaign operations you seek, I am the one to ask.
11582 : Unfortunately, I am not authorized to provide campaign information to those who do not belong to the Knights of the Iron Ram.
11583 : Welcome to the Knights of the Iron Ram, %! If you wish, I can give you a simple explanation of your duties.
11584 : Are you familiar with Op Credits? Yes. No.
11585 : You are? It is heartening to know the Kingdom employs such knowledgeable [men/women].
11586 : Let me see... Ah yes, % of the Knights of the Iron Ram. It seems you possess # [Op Credit/Op Credits].
11587 : Will you participate in an operation today? Yes, if possible. What exactly are Op Credits? View your nation's information. Not at this time.
11588 : Listen carefully, %. To ensure balance in the Allied Campaign, the Allied War Council has developed a voucher system that regulates the three nations' participation in operations.
11589 : Each member of each army is rationed these vouchers, known as Op Credits.
11590 : At least one credit is needed to take part in most campaign operations, with more advanced missions requiring additional vouchers, and are issued at the rate of one every [day/ten minutes].
11591 : However, please note that once an Op Credit is used, it will not be refunded in the event you abandon an operation without completing your duties.
11592 : Understood. Please speak with me again when you have completed your preparations.
11593 : Ah... I am sorry to report that there are no campaign operations available for you at the moment. Please use this time to regain your strength, and speak with me again at a later date.

11723 : No.##
11724 : Hey, you're in the way. We fortifyin' this here wall to withstand the beastmen's siege turrets. So how's about just gettin' outta here before you get hurt.
11725 : Unless you're willin' to wipe that helpless look off your face and lend us a hand. That'd be a different story.
11726 : Assist with the fortifications? Show them how it's done! Refuse to help. Ask for an explanation.
11727 : Alright! That's the spirit! Let's get a move on, then.
11728 : Hmph, I figured as much by lookin' at you. Beat it, then. This is no place for tourists.
11729 : Like I said, in preparation for an enemy assault, we're workin' to fortify these defensive barriers. If you're willin', I'd like to place you in charge of managin' these here craftsmen as they go about it.
11730 : To be more precise, once you get to each craftsman's position, you have to tell 'em exactly what I'm about to tell you. Namely, what type of crystal they need to be usin'. That's all there is to it.
11731 : The young Elvaan wearin' the red hat is a blacksmith. Make sure he's using fire crystals.
11732 : The adorable little Tarutaru with the blonde braids is laying plaster. Gonna have to get her on some ice crystals.
11733 : The Hume lady is a stonemason, and a darn good one. She's gonna be needin' wind crystals.
11734 : That old coot of an Elvaan with the huge axe strapped across his back is a carpenter. Famous 'round these parts. Make sure you get him workin' with earth crystals.
11735 : May not look it, but the Mithra with the black kerchief wrapped 'round her noggin is an architect. She's gonna need her lightning crystals.
11736 : That sprat of a Tarutaru wearin' the blue getup's a handy lil' plumber. Surin' he'll be wantin' his water crystals, no doubt.
11737 : The good-looking fella in all white does scaffoldin'. Young Hume lad. See to it he's usin' light crystals.
11738 : The lady Elvaan's a painter. Handles a brush like nobody I never seen. Need dark crystals in that line of work. And that's it.
11739 : Ahhh, one more thing. If you're too late issuin' your orders, they're liable to up and leave their posts. So be right, and be quick.
11740 : Choose a crystal! Fire crystal. Ice crystal. Wind crystal. Earth crystal. Lightning crystal. Water crystal. Light crystal. Dark crystal. Plumb give up.
11741 : Hey now, you're runnin' this here operation! You can't just quit! There's no quitting in war!
11742 : Wow... You sure botched that job. All them wrong orders threw the craftsmen off kilter. They're demandin' a new foreman.
11743 : Well, the good news is you're gettin' your orders right. The bad news is that you're takin' your sweet time doing it. We'll never be ready for the Beastmen at this rate.
11744 : Come on, now! You even want to win this war!? The craftsmen are startin' to strike thanks to your incompetence!
11747 : NPC#
11748 : [///]
11749 : Ah, you must be %. We've been expecting you.
11750 : The delivery took you # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
11751 : The delivery took you # [minute/minutes] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
11752 : While you were dawdling your way here, a separate shipment of construction materials was delivered to us. We shan't be requiring anymore.
11753 : I commend you on your expeditiousness. Thanks to you, the construction work on our provision storehouse here can proceed as planned.
11754 : So you have something to aspire to, the quickest delivery thus far was made by %. That indefatigable soldier traversed the same course as you in just # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
11755 : You're the current quickest delivery record holder, with a lightning-fast time of # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time). But that's no excuse to slack off, you hear?
11756 : Time elapsed: # [hour/hours] (Vana'diel time) # [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] (Earth time)
11757 : You find nothing out of the ordinary.
11758 : A shiver runs down your spine...
11759 : Perhaps you should first attend to more pressing matters...
11760 : Something tells you that you should wait a moment and try again.
11761 : I am far too busy to speak with you now. Perhaps I'll have a little time later.
11762 : Good show on your last operation. Now go make an official report to Sir Rasdinice.
11763 : Good work on that last operation. Now report back to First Centurion Hieronymus before he has your hide!
11764 : Nice job on your last operation. Now don't forget to report back to Emhi Tchaoryo!
11765 : It seems that you were not successful in your last operation. But do not let one small failure hang heavy on your soul. Report to Sir Rasdinice and put this all behind you.
11766 : Weren't so lucky during that last operation, were you? Well, don't worry about it too much. Report to First Centurion Hieronymus and get some rest, soldier.
11767 : Hmmm... Didn't do so well on that last operation, did you? I know it's hard, but it's better if you're up-front about these things. If you know what's good for you, you'll hurry down and report to Emhi Tchaoryo before the major finds out first.
11768 : Make haste, %. Sir Rasdinice awaits your report!
11769 : What are you waiting for, %? Report to First Centurion Hieronymus on the double!
11770 : Why are you wasting your time chatting with me? Shouldn't you be reporting to Emhi Tchaoryo?
11771 : Good work, soldier. [The Kingdom/The Republic/The Federation] thanks you for your cooperation.
11772 : I am charged with the provisioning of supplies for our troops out on the battlefield. I can issue you temporary items in exchange for Allied Notes.
11773 : Select a temporary item. (Price) Nothing at this time. Browse another page. %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) Next page. Previous page.

11775 : Browse which page? Never mind. Page 1. Page 2. Page 3. Page 4.
11776 : It appears you're already in possession of one. I'm sorry, but we can only afford to issue supplies to those who are most in need.
11777 : I'm sorry, but we're fresh out of stock for that item.
11778 : You must attain a higher rank if you wish to be issued %.
11779 : Is there anything else you require?
11780 : Let the Blade of the Conqueror once again bring glory to the Kingdom!
11781 : Gwahahaha! Let me cool you off a little before I send you to hell!
11782 : Father! Lend me your strength!
11783 : For the king!
11784 : My spear is lightning...and your scream shall be the thunder which follows my mighty strike!
11785 : Ha hah! Your arrows cannot pierce the iron will of a true knight!
11786 : This arrow to your heart shall be Altana's final judgment.
11787 : Shogyo Mujo! Zesho Meppo! Shometsu Metsui! Jakumetsu Iraku!
11788 : There is no escape...save death!
11789 : Altana! Let your divine light guide us to victory!
11790 : You barbarians will regret the day you set foot on Bastokan soil!
11791 : Ryaaaaaaaaah!
11792 : Men! Do not fear the enemy! It is our blades they shall fear!
11793 : A swift end is the only mercy you will receive from me, fiends!
11794 : Watch carefully, because this is the last thing you'll ever see in this life!
11795 : I never liked fighting on land... Now, give me a well armed battleship on the open sea, and I'll have those turtlebacks running for their lives!
11796 : A soldier always comes prepared! Hehehehe!
11797 : To your seats, boys! The show is about to begin!
11798 : Ahahahaha! My hand slipped!
11799 : This is your last chance. Throw down your weapons and your life will be spared. If you refuse...
11800 : The gates to the underworld have opened! I'll see you on the other side...or not! Wahahahahah!
11801 : There is nothing more magnificent than the dance of flames on the battlefield!
11802 : <Phew!> I think I've had enough of this volume!
11803 : Guttler: Guttler thirsty! Guttler want blood! More blood!
11804 : Time to go to work!
11805 : Invincible! Indestructible! Indubitable! The age of the Cardians is upon us!
11806 : You, over there. No, wait! You're supposed to be on that side! Hold on, which one were you again? Arrrghhh!
11807 : <Snorrre>... Is that the best you can do?
11808 : Petty beastman hordes are nothing compared to giant wildebeests of homeland! I swat you all down like fruit flies!
11809 : <Yawn>... Um... Holy light...show the way...?
11810 : The protection of the throne comes before all else. Only by direct order of the royaulais will I wield my blade on the battlefield. Such is the duty of the Royal Guards.
11811 : Hah hah hah! The ringing of steel upon steel! The dripping stench of the battlefield! What could be better than war? The nobles can have their balls, I'll do my dance on the front lines!
11812 : How dare a baseborn peasant raise [his/her] voice to a noble knight!? Begone, before I strike you down myself!
11813 : The Kingdom's defeat at Jugner still stings. To avenge the souls of those lost on that fateful day, we must join hands and take up arms as one.
11814 : Not once in the four hundred years since the dawn of the Royal Knights has the Kingdom found itself in such peril. Let us take up our pikes and stand our ground to ensure another four centuries of prosperity!
11815 : It is often in times of strife that a man's true nature is revealed. Will you stand tall in the face of fear, or run and cower in the wake of your mother's dress?
11816 : While our holy doctrines specifically prohibit the taking of another life, you need not hesitate on the battlefield. The Church has branded the beastmen enemies of Altana. The purification must begin! It is the will of the Goddess!!!
11817 : After years of training in the Far East, I return only to find my nation burning at the hands of the infernal beastman hordes. The heathens shall pay dearly... My work has only just begun.
11818 : You have the look of a fine warrior. It is a pity you are not one of my Crimson Wolves.
11819 : The eyes of the Goddess are ever upon us. We must remain steadfast against the evils from without, as well as those from within.
11820 : The Republic was formed with the blood and sweat of the people. The flames of freedom must continue to light our furnaces of strength. The waters of civilization must continue to turn our wheels of ingenuity!
11821 : Turtle sleeps in a rocky den 'Cause he's not a citizen Strike him down with sword and stave Stick a blue flag in his grave
11822 : We may have the upper hand in technology and munitions, but the enemy's advantage lies in their sheer numbers. The Allied Campaign will not win in a day, soldier. Make every bullet count.
11823 : The Metalworks' strategies are too timid for my taste. The beastmen are nothing but dominoes, waiting to be toppled. A swift, aggressive assault is the only way to victory.
11824 : Move along, soldier. I have nothing to say to you.
11825 : Halt! If you're not one of the Fourth, then get your sorry tail over to the recruitment office on the double! And if you are one of us, then what the hell are you doing here talking to me!? Get back on the battlefield! About...FACE!
11826 : ...Heavy infantry, five columns of 200... Two 100-knight regiments... Enemy force casualties estimated at 5,000... Oh, I apologize, soldier. I've spent the past few nights preparing for a joint operation with San d'Oria's Royal Knights.
11827 : You look like you've seen better days, soldier. Let me guess, it's the war that's bringing you down. What you need is a little music in your life!
11828 : If it weren't for the Galkan heavy infantry, this nation wouldn't last a month against the turtlebacks. And what thanks do we get? A handful of stale army biscuits!
11829 : Have you ever stopped to ponder what that comet might truly portend? I'd like to believe it is a message of hope--that soon this age of darkness will come to a close...
11830 : Oh, whatever has become of my sweet Windurst? Rabble running through the streets, streets overrun with rabble! Why are you even speaking to me!? Does the title Master Caster no longer garner even an onz of respect!?
11831 : Ah, the Fates have brought you to Gariri the Magnificent! Why am I thus called, you ask? Why, because only I was magnificent enough to decryptify those mysteriously marvelous Near Eastern tomes and open a window to...the Other Side!
11832 : We all wear masks because deep down inside we are nothing but beasts. The question I ask you is, to which do you submit--the mask, or the beast?
11833 : (Guttler! I told you to keep qui--) Ahahahah... Don't mind me, I was just...uh...keeping myself company! (Shhh! If you open your mouth one more ti--) Ahahaha... Uh, were you still there?
11834 : If only the Parliament of Patriarchs would loosen the strings on their purses a little more, I would be outside right now roasting up a couple birdmen to snack on!
11835 : Have fun while you can, filthy mercenary, because before long you'll be back on the streets where you belong--replaced by a quiet, obedient army of Cardians!
11836 : Normally, it is my duty to protect the patriarchs of parliament, but with the fate of Windurst in doubt, I'm forced to lead my loyal pets to the front lines.
11837 : Do you like the headpiece? I made it from my firrrst victim. I wear it to let everrryone know what happens when they cross Mikhe Aryohcha!
11838 : Back in my home, Ulbuka, I hear rumors of great riches in eastern lands. But now I am here, and where are riches? I see nothing but Tarus! Ahahahaha!
11839 : <Yaaawn>... Mastering these Near Eastern magics can be quite taxing. If I had a choice, I'd rather be back in bed, relaxing...
11840 : I saved this one especially for you!
11841 : Hiiiiii-yah!
11842 : My dear pupil, Dalzakk. You still have much to learn...
11843 : Witness the true embodiment of my sorrow.
11844 : Heh heh heh!
11845 : <Giggle>...
11846 : Wheheheheh! You thirsty, Kopeh?
11847 : Come, Kilhwch! We must strike down the evil which stands before us!
11848 : My brothers and sisters! Raise your blades for justice!
11849 : Kilhwch! Silence those fiends!
11850 : To your feet, Kilhwch!
11851 : Lady Ulla. We must retreat.
11852 : How dare you!
11853 : The raven shalt spare nary a tear for thy demise.
11854 : Watch! And see how a real mercenary earrrns her wage!
11855 : Leave me be. The verge of battle is no time for words.
11856 : Fear not. My fists will guide us to victory.
11857 : My daughter awaits her father at home. I will permit no Beastman to delay my return.
11858 : Beyond this point lies the sealed royal tomb of King Ranperre. Tell me, %, do you believe the legends?
11859 : The Orc war machine draws near. We must brace ourselves for battle.
11860 : In former times, this island was inhabited by a ferocious tribe of vikings. It is said they braved vast expanses of open sea to arrive here. Romantic, don't you think?
11861 : Surely you have seen the tigers that roam these downs. They were brought from the northern continent by the Orcs themselves. They are highly prized for their luxurious pelts, though their bloodlust makes them formidable game.
11862 : The brotherhood of this place once welcomed me long ago. I pray that the years have been kind to them.
11863 : The Gold Musketeers of the Republican Army are marshalled by young woman. Such talk is sure to inspire my daughter.
11864 : Bastok was forced to abandon the Palborough Mines following a Beastman invasion. How an army such as the Republic's could permit such an affront baffles me to no end.
11865 : The village elder in La Vaule told me of the so-called wyrm deity of Grauberg. Of course, I am sure it is nothing more than folktales. Still, my curiosity is piqued...
11866 : Strange... I am certain the vegetation of this area is different from when I last visited. Surely I would not have allowed myself to forget such beautiful flowers.
11867 : Such devasation... Even the resilient Goobbue were not able to survive. I wonder if this place shall ever be restored to its former glory...
11868 : History tells us that it was in the year 381 that San d'Oria's iron-tempered  King Lanfeaur R d'Oraguille came these lands to strike a peace with the Quadav. Whatever happened to the bond that was formed...?
11869 : I have seen here two twins who between them share a power for magic the likes of which I have never seen. This is indeed a strange nation.
11870 : Unfortunate... I had always wished to gaze upon the fabled magic towers of West Sarutabaruta with my own eyes. Yet I fear I may be too late...
11871 : This fortress is lauded as the impregnable point of Windurst's defenses. Goddess forbid, should it happen to be taken, Windurst is unlikely to last more than a month's time.
11872 : These windblown sands reak havoc on my throat. I look forward to a cup of my daughter's fine Batallia tea.
11873 : Take heed, %. I have seen Beastman-dug battle trenches throughout these plains. Should you be found, your life is forfeit.
11874 : There is an ominous feeling in the air... This is no place to linger.
11875 : Never have I felt a cold as piercing as this. My teeth chatter and my toes grow numb. We would do well to find a place to warm ourselves.
11876 : I wonder if it was not somewhere near here where minister Francmage was dispatched on the Multinational Expedition some 10 years ago.
11877 : Never did I imagine the day would come that I would set foot in this accursed place. Has great is our foe's desperation? Do not lower your guard, %.
11878 : And so we breach the enemy's inner sanctum. Expect anything, %! And don't die on me!
11879 : As the Allied Forces have long maintained, this citadel would be ideally suited to the defense of Jeuno.
11880 : A well conceived strategy... A stronghold established under the cover of the nest of these vile crawlers. It is almost surely to be overlooked by the enemy.
11881 : Oh, mighty Altana, be the sword in my hand. With you, the swift cannot flee, nor the strong escape. Receive mine enemies, for the mercy of the Goddess embraces even the wicked.
11882 : Heh heh heh! Wonder what technique I should try out on these ol' beastmen chumps.
11883 : Haha... Who will be the next darling recipient of my spells?
11884 : Red blood, blue blood, any colorrr blood. If it bleeds, we can kill it!
11885 : What's taking so long? I'm getting all antsy-wantsy! My pets are I are all bad at staying still...
11886 : Do not fear. Righteousness will prevail. I shall show you victory!
11887 : Promise me one thing. Should anything happen to me... Look after my daughter.
11888 : I reckon I'll be earnin' my keep. Won't be doin' nothin' extra, though. Don't be expectin' me to risk my hide without my due an' proper, mm-hmmm.
11889 : Bravo really is a dear once you get to know him. It's just that in the heat of battle he... Well, you'll see.
11890 : My blade, Kyomon, anticipates much beastman blood. This battle may prove interesting, yet.
11891 : Look to me, mortals! And be haunted for the rest of your brief time in this world!
11892 : For a split second, you thought you saw Titania turn and shoot you a tiny smile.
11893 : The flower atop Babban Ny Mheillea's head appears to be in full bloom!
11894 : Ribbit! Ribbit!
11895 : You'd better watch your back!
11896 : Don't take this personally, but I've got children to feed.
11897 : Time to have some fun!
11898 : Reckon it's time tuh earn my keep, mm-hmm.
11899 : Come now, Bravo! It's high time we taught these beasts what a wyvern is truly capable of!
11900 : Hehe, so many willing to be sacrificed!
11901 : Hmph. Perhaps I should just burn the eyes of these infidels with my true form.
11902 : I fear not death, for the Goddess awaits us with open arms.
11903 : It is not yet your time.
11904 : Be strong, for the Goddess is with you, always.
11905 : Return to the dust whence you came! Randgrith!!!
11906 : Saints and heroes...glory and despair... Of these I shall sing unto my dying breath.
11907 : When work has ended stay not late. Return to where thy dearest awaits.
11908 : O gentle Goddess of the Dawn, thou brighten the black of night. Hear our song and heed our call, and bathe us in your delight.
11909 : Press forward valiant soldiers, glory draws nearer still. Thy deeds shall resound forever, by my stirring song fulfilled.
11910 : Loyal children of Altana, arise and be sustained. Be nourished in thine undying faith, and bask in victory's refrain.
11911 : Sing! Dance! Laugh, and cry! Let sweat rain down in floods! Ride upon this rhythmic beat, make seethe thy red life blood!
11912 : Dance thine elegant, airy steps that has won a thousand hearts. Enchant, enthrall, and captivate, treat none with disregard.
11913 : Honored am I to have this chance to share the same stage with you.

12033 : You the new temporay raid recruit? Alright, listen up, soldier! I'm gonna keep this short and simple, so's you can understand it real good-like. The sole purpose of your existence is to attack Beastman supply divisions and seize any viable cargo!
12034 : Our best intelligence indicates that the enemy units we're after most frequently pass through an area when it is under Beastman influence.
12035 : You are to infiltrate said area and promptly locate and dispatch said enemy. You are then to proceed to acquire any and all enemy-held supplies and return here with them. Is that understood, soldier!?
12036 : Due to the strain the war has put on our supply levels, the Allied War Council has recommended that we hire hundreds of new initiates to help with the synthesis of new items. However, with the guildmasters all working overtime manufacturing goods, we don't have enough manpower to aid us in the training of the new recruits.
12037 : Because our guild members are working around the clock making supplies, they do not have the time to learn new techniques or develop new methods. If you have extensive training in a skill and wouldn't mind passing that knowledge on to a fellow craftsman, we could sure use the help.
12038 : Would you lend a hand? Of course! I'm sorry. My hands are tied.
12039 : That is unfortunate. There are men and women dying on the frontlines because they don't have the supplies they need to drive back the beastman hordes. If you are just going to look the other way, then so be it...
12040 : Your assistance is much appreciated. May I ask in what field do you specialize?
12041 : Select your area of expertise: Woodworking. Smithing. Goldsmithing. Clothcraft. Leatherworking. Bonecraft. Alchemy. Cooking.
12042 : According to these papers, you are not qualified enough in that field to provide that guild with the services they require. I'm sorry, but I am going to have to turn you away.

12066 : Thank you. Our guildworkers will benefit greatly from this knowledge. I'll have them start synthesizing right away.
12067 : What the...!? And you call yourself a crafting expert!? You've just wasted our valuable time and resources! Get out before I call the city guard!
12068 : Wonderful! The guildworkers should have the recipe mastered in no time!
12069 : Now, let us continue.
12070 : Now, let us continue.
12071 : You have been a great help, %! The knowledge you were able to pass on today will aid in the overall improvement of our workforce.

12073 : , a hero's story! The deeds of %, in all their glory
12074 : A traveling bard walks far and near While wand'ring this celestial sphere From bustling towns to godforsaken lands. But none I love more than the swell Inhabitants of Vana'diel, Espec'lly when their gil comes to my hands.
12075 : Pay me what you think I'm worth And songs of legend may spring forth.

12083 : , a hero of our time! The name of % throughout the world will chime

12088 : You have no achievements to unlock.
12089 : I am Rongelouts, commander of the Knights of the Iron Ram of the Royal Knights of San d'Oria. I shall personally set straight any cowards in our ranks. It would not be long before they would come to fear my sword more than beastman claw!
12090 : We must not give in to fear in the face of the Beastman Confederate. I shall personally set straight any cowards in our ranks. It would not be long before they would come to fear my sword more than beastman claw!
12091 : That shop has closed down. The owner went missing right after the war broke out. Shame, too. He was such a nice fellow.
12092 : Troupe Mayakov has had the entire Lion Springs Tavern rented out for rehearsals. There's been a near constant stream of dancers going in and out recently. Unmistakable bunch, them.
12093 : Hey you, whaddaya say to a little friendly wager? The Allied Forces of Altana or the Beastman Confederate? Where's your money?
12094 : Haha, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Never mind me.
12095 : Such a gruesome scene... Who would have thought monsters like that existed in this world?
12096 : Out of nowhere, an enormous worm rose up from the belly of the earth itself. With its huge mouth it effortlessly swallowed up a number of nearby soldiers, who were helpless to react.
12097 : Even if the city is invaded by beastmen, the Victory Gate alone must be defended to the last. It has been the pride of San d'Oria for generations! It must not fall!
12098 : Access beyond the Victory Gate is not permitted at this time.
12099 : That rich, black plumage. Those sturdy, sure legs. Not like those scrawny green and blue chocobos you see the other nations turning out, huh?
12100 : San d'Orian chocobos are of the finest breeding. It goes without saying that our birds are far superior to those of Windurst and Bastok.
12101 : Bakgodek vegbreg... Come soon... You die all...
12102 : My word, those forsaken Royal Knights... It was bad enough when I heard they were scavenging the broken weapons of the Orcs, but now they are leaving them strewn about the city!
12103 : I don't know if they intend to study them or use them as toys for our children! All I do know is that we Temple Knights will have to clean up their mess, as always!
12104 : This is the territory of the Young Griffons. Leave if you have no business here! Those are the rules.
12105 : Heeey, that's not fair! I wanna get in, too!
12106 : Great power lies in one's drive. What drives you, adventurer?
12107 : Here, let me have a turn.
12108 : Hey, don't push! Move over!
12109 : Stop, that's mine!
12110 : ...
12111 : I'm gonna tell!
12112 : According to the latest rumors, the beastmen are after nothing more than crystals.
12113 : It seems we are not the only inhabitants of Vana'diel who are dependant on crystals for our survival.
12114 : I don't think any had imagined that the scattered beastmen would conspire to align with one another. And then to organize an offensive, of all things! There must be a great and evil charisma at work...
12115 : Do you know of the Multinational Expedition that was dispatched to the cursed lands of the north ten years ago? I've heard that it was an extremely dangerous mission, and the team was met with many misfortunes.
12116 : Now, as long ago, it is the Orcs who are the archenemies of San d'Oria. I wonder how long we will remain at war with one another...
12117 : We lost many of our fellow knights in the battle at La Theine. To have suffered such a crushing defeat at the hands of the beastmen is...disconcerting.
12118 : I cannot believe we allowed the orcs to encircle our city... Still, though he commands the enemy, this Doggvdegg is a truly bold warrior.
12119 : Just recently I saw a mysterious cat-like figure donning a fire-red mantle pass right before my eyes on the battlefield. It moved with such speed and grace... Perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me...
12120 : There are rumors that the Beastman Confederate numbers some 100,000 in total, but I find that hard to believe. The valor of the small Royal Knight contingent dispatched against the Orcish Hosts at Norvallen must not be overshadowed.
12121 : Those Norvallen few fought unflinchingly to the very brink of obliteration... Their leader, Marquis Leonoyne, was saved by the brave fighting of Count Alphonimile and his 300 noble troops.
12122 : I still don't understand why our nation must lower itself to allying with such a shady lot. I've heard that the Ru'Lude Summit had its fair share of complications. Not exactly all smiles and handshakes, if you know what I mean.
12123 : The expansion of the Orcish Hosts is much too fast as of late. Is San d'Oria not doing all that she can?
12124 : Commander Rongelouts's Knights of the Iron Ram are the most elite knights of the San d'Orian order. This red headgear is our trademark.
12125 : A fiery mass soared from the eastern to the western skies... To be honest, I felt that perhaps the end of time had come...
12126 : This is Watchdog Alley. I would not tread too near the hanging cages down yonder path. Your presence may send the imprisoned fiends into a rage.
12127 : Glory to the lion!
12128 : A knight's work is never done...
12129 : Sweep like you mean it!
12130 : If you seek admission to the Knights of the Iron Ram, speak with Sir Mainchelite.
12131 : Looking to join the Fighting Fourth? Speak to Centurion Adelbrecht. He'll assist you.
12132 : So you think you have what it takes to be a Cobra? Well, then talk to Miah Riyuh and hope that she's in a good mood!
12133 : For the lion!
12134 : Give 'em hell, %!
12135 : Shouldn't you be out campaigning? Now get!
12136 : I see you serve under another nation.
12137 : I see you're working for another nation.
12138 : Says here you've already gone and joined some other nation's forces.
12139 : If you seek admission to the Knights of the Iron Ram, speak with Sir Mainchelite.
12140 : If you're looking to join the Fighting Fourth, speak to Centurion Adelbrecht. He'll assist you.
12141 : If you've finally come to your senses and decided on joining the Cobras then talk to Miah Riyuh...and hope that she's in a good mood!
12142 : If you seek to regain admission to the Knights of the Iron Ram, you must first sever ties with your nation of allegiance...and that will require Allied Notes.
12143 : Though if you want to rejoin the fourth, I think something can be worked out. You have some Allied Notes, don't you?
12144 : But if you've finally come to your senses and decided to return to the Cobras, I think I can pull a few strings...for a price. You're carrying Allied Notes, right?
12145 : Please note that upon changing allegiance, you will be required to return the two most prestigious campaign medals you possess. There is no penalty if you have yet to earn any medals.
12147 : Exchange # Allied [Note/Notes] to transfer from [/the Knights of the Iron Ram/the Fourth Division/the Cobra Unit] to [/the Knights of the Iron Ram/the Fourth Division/the Cobra Unit]? You currently possess # [Allied Note/Allied Notes].
12148 : Proceed with the transaction? Yes. No.
12149 : Are you absolutely sure? Yes. No.
12150 : Your transfer from [/the Knights of the Iron Ram/the Fourth Division/the Cobra Unit] to [/the Knights of the Iron Ram/the Fourth Division/the Cobra Unit] is complete.
12151 : You cannot pledge your allegiance to one nation while undertaking initiation procedures of another. Withdraw your current application before attempting a transfer.
12152 : You return your %.
12153 : You are now a member of the [/Knights of the Iron Ram/Republican Legion's Fourth Division/Cobra Unit]!
12154 : You do not possess enough Allied Notes to change your allegiance.
12155 : I'm terribly sorry, but chocobo services are currently unavailable.
12156 : Beyond this gateway lie the Iron Ram barracks. Here knights oil their blades before returning to the battlefield.
12157 : Is that [her/him] over there?
12158 : Hm? Why, I do believe it is! Hello there, ummm...new...pupil!
12159 : I do say, Ulbrecht, the least you could do is attempt to remember some of the new pupils' names.
12160 : Oh, he's just doing it on purpose. I believe he enjoys coming across a bit aloof. There's no point in chastising him. None ataru all.
12161 : It's no wonder Erlene is at her wit's end.
12162 : You know, for peers, you certainly are an unsparing lot.
12163 : If [he/she] is my junior, then it stands to reason that [he/she] is junior to all of you as well. Might I be so bold as to ask exactly how you all came to hold yourselves above the standards you so eagerly apply to others?
12164 : You certainly arrived sooner than I expected, %.
12165 : If even the new pupil has arrived by now, what do you gather is keeping Fhen?
12166 : Even considering the distance from Windurst, there is no reason she should be so delayed.
12167 : We first scheduled this meeting some time ago. There are, however, some parties who have yet to arrive.
12168 : Unfortunately, there are urgent matters elsewhere which demand our immediate attention. I'm afraid I can only offer you the briefest of explanations.
12169 : Initial investigations conducted by security forces on behalf of all nations have yielded disconcerting results. The Beastmen may well be seeking to compromise the Allied Forces' decision-making and strategizing capabilities through a series of sneak attacks on our magic-wielding intelligentsia.
12170 : A diversionary tactic, to be sure. They will most likely change their play while we are occupied with gathering intel.
12171 : I see plans within plans...
12172 : That is where we scholars come in.
12173 : Suffice it to say that we have certain...means...of taking care of this type of thing. Each nation has its own specialistarus who revel in flushing out fugi-wugitives at large.
12174 : That is in part why we sought to convene here today. It was our belief that a thorough analysis of the information we have all gathered would naturally reveal the identity of the culprit.
12175 : Yet we are missing a key piece. I fear... No, it would be improper of me to say.
12176 : Surely you aren't implying that something has happened to Fhen!?
12177 : You are too quick to jump to conclusions. The war rages to new expanses with each passing day. It is by no means an understatement to say that the safe roads of passage have all but disappeared from both continents.
12178 : Not to mention that Fhen is the professor's most stellar pupil. It is no small feat to have mastered the Schultzian arts to the extent that she has. I would gladly put my gil on her, should any beastman be foolish enough to cross her path.
12179 : True enough.
12180 : So what do you propose we do?
12181 : This council will disband for the time being. And the main roads between Windurst and here should be scoured with a fine-toothed comb.
12182 : I see no other alternatives.
12183 : Then that settles it.
12184 : %, though your journey has just ended, I ask that you head back to inform Erlene of what has transpired here.
12185 : After that, please aid in the search for Fhen. We shall meet again in Sauromugue Champaign. Go now.
12186 : All clear to the north! All clear to the east! No enemies detected! Perimeter secured!
12187 : Ah, hectic is the life of a castellan. But ever vigilant must I remain in the absence of Captain Rahal and the others.
12188 : Greetings, %! Exceptional timing, as always! In my authority as Castellan of Swiftwing Fortress, I relay to you these mission orders.
12189 : You are to gather and bring hither the following three items:
12190 : First, %.
12191 : Making cuts on tree trunks out in Ronfaure should yield an adequate amount.
12192 : Next on the list, some %.
12193 : These are oft stowed within the cavity of trees throughout the Kingdom in preparation for times of emergency. Rest assured, we shall only be borrowing them.
12194 : Which brings us to the third and final item, %.
12195 : For this, you need but draw water from the well over yonder.
12196 : That concludes your orders!
12197 : The first item on the list is %.
12198 : Making cuts on tree trunks out in Ronfaure should yield an adequate amount.
12199 : Next on the list, %.
12200 : These are oft stowed within the cavity of trees throughout the Kingdom.
12201 : % is the third and final item.
12202 : For this, you need but draw water from the well over yonder.
12203 : That concludes the list of items. Report back to me upon procurement and you will be further briefed.
12204 : A container of utilitarian design has been stowed inside the tree hollow.
12205 : You draw water from the well.
12206 : What? You would know my opinion of the Swiftwing Griffins?
12207 : The have unexpectedly rigid backbones...for a bunch of maggots. But many more indignities must be overcome on their part if they hope to become anything more than ankle weights.
12208 : Now then. How do you explain your dawdling here? For every minute you stand in idle inactivity, the Kingdom loses ground to the enemy.
12209 : If you seek Captain Rahal, I fear he has yet to return.
12210 : I have a unit of knights to oversee. If you've nothing of import to discuss, then away with you.
12211 : Welcome back, %. Let's see what you've brought... Maple syrup, long-life biscuits, and freshly drawn water. All appears to be in good order!
12212 : Voila! I give you biscuits a la Rholont!
12213 : Hm? Why did I prepare such a delectable treat, you ask?
12214 : Captain Rahal and a few others from our unit, you see, have convened out in Jugner Forest to participate in a strategy meeting with the Iron Rams.
12215 : My sources tell me that the Swiftwing Griffins will be awarded the charge of escorting the Royal Provisioners--a responsibility of considerable import in anyone's book.
12216 : The biscuits will be pivotal in helping our men fend off untimely hunger pangs during the proceedings. Without sustenance, they couldn't hope to survive one of Captain Rongelouts's legendarily verbose sermons.
12217 : I would make the delivery myself, but for my post as Castellan of Swiftwing Fortress. Therefore, in my stead, I bid you take the biscuits to our people in Jugner Forest.
12218 : May the Goddess speed your way, %!
12219 : The Swiftwing Griffins are currently on standby out in Jugner Forest for a strategy meeting with the Iron Rams.
12220 : Please see to it that the % are safely delivered to the hands of Captain Rahal.
12221 : Welcome back from your mission! Did our men take heart from the special rations we prepared?
12222 : You seek Machegue? He departed the fortress not a moment after returning from afield. In his haste, he scarce had the breath to inform me that he was headed for Vunkerl Inlet.
12223 : Ah! Welcome back, %!
12224 : Relieved am I to see you safe and sound. To a castellan, few things are more gratifying than receiving one's own back from afield.
12225 : Greetings, %. From what Captain Rahal has told me of recent happenings, you've been on quite a ride.
12226 : The most important thing is that you've not come to any harm.
12227 : At this very moment, the captain should be making a report to Royal Knight General Cousseraux himself. Our unit continues its meteoric rise to distinction!
12228 : %!
12229 : 'Tis good to see you back.
12230 : But...your being here would mean that Orcish intelligence on the Cardinal Stags' location was inaccurate?
12231 : That reminds me, were Cyranuce and Machegue not with you, %?
12232 : Wh-what?
12233 : Machegue...is...?
12234 : ...
12235 : Tell us this isn't so, %... That this is but a tasteless jest...
12236 : I cannot believe it...
12237 : %.
12238 : Take me to the Pashhow Marshlands, to where Machegue is. As Captain, I need--I need to...
12239 : Going somewhere, maggot?
12240 : !!!
12241 : C-Captain Rongelouts... I've not time to linger. Please let me pass.
12242 : So...you have the blood of one of your own on your hands.
12243 : What!?
12244 : Seize him.
12245 : Wh-what is the meaning of this? Unhand me! Unhand me, I say!
12246 : Take him away.
12247 : C-Captain Rahal!
12248 : I owe you for that time back at the Garlaige Citadel.
12249 : The Knights of the Cardinal Stag have altered their course and now pass through the Pashhow Marshlands, correct?
12250 : Indebted as I already am, I must ask for yet another favor. I need you to take this letter and see it to the hands of Alphonimile.
12251 : We go a long way back, he and I. It is imperative that the words sealed within are made known to him.
12252 : I'm counting on you.
12253 : I hope the captain is all right...
12254 : Machegue...
12255 : That we will never see Machegue again... The reality of it has yet to sink in.
12256 : Best you deliver the letter to Alphonimile while the Cardinal Stags have yet to depart the Pashhow Marshlands. I'm counting on you.
12257 : So, he resumed the expedition to Tavnazia, even after the behemoth was defeated...
12258 : Not that I had expected Alphonimile to do otherwise. He's been a man of unwavering resolve for as long as I've known him.
12259 : That reminds me, it's time to release that lively little maggot from his confinement in the barracks.
12260 : Thanks to you, one more maggot has a fighting chance of maturing into a fly.
12261 : Take this as a small expression of my gratitude. You've earned it.
12262 : Company, halt!
12263 : An unseasonal storm? Even nature fancies to declare war on us...
12264 : Do my eyes play tricks? The sky...is shaking?
12265 : Th-that light!?
12266 : Hmm!?
12267 : Cardinal Stags, seek shelter!
12268 : (Hmm... This is happening a little earlier than was recorded in history...)
12269 : (Earthquake!?)
12270 : (That strange light!? Zogbog, you speak of explosion...)
12271 : ('Twas indeed the explosion of which I spoke, my lord.)
12272 : (You have just witnessed the separation of the Tavnazian Peninsula from the mainland, and the ensuing birth of the Tavnazian Archipelago.)
12273 : (I can't believe... More than sixty thousand of our soldier there...)
12274 : ('Tis unfortunate, my lord, but a great many of them shall never again set foot on the face of Vana'diel.)
12275 : ...
12276 : (But take heart, for failure is the mother of success.)
12277 : (What you say?)
12278 : ('Tis only a matter of time before the walls of Tavnazia crumble beneath the weight of our remaining three behemoths.)
12279 : (Furthermore...)
12280 : (Members of the Bloodwing Horde that were relieved by the beasts--a goodly two thousand elite soldiers--have been returned to your service unscathed.)
12281 : (With them under your leadership, your authority over the ever-weakening armies of the Shadow Lord is certain to flourish.)
12282 : (Hmm... You speak truth.)
12283 : (I keep promise. I grant you command of five hundred elite.)
12284 : (M-my lord! Your generosity is boundless!)
12285 : (Now then... What do you get when two thousand battle-hardened soldiers of the Bloodwing Horde purportedly lost in Tavnazia find themselves in Xarcabard?)
12286 : (The plot thickens...)
12287 : (Gahahahaha...)
12288 : The entire Kingdom is in an uproar with talk of the secret weapon supposedly employed by the beastmen at Tavnazia.
12289 : Why, some of the rumors even go so far as to suggest that the entire Tavnazian Peninsula was wiped off the map! Could such a horrendous thing truly have taken place?
12290 : But as the saying goes, where there is smoke, there is fire... We can only hope that no harm has befallen Excenmille.
12291 : All communication with the Marquisate has ceased since that unexplained occurrence...
12292 : Confound it! Had only we conclusive evidence, I would have stopped at nothing to prevent him from continuing on to Tavnazia!
12293 : Ah, Squire Altennia! % approaches!
12294 : Well met, %. It does my spirit well to see you again.
12295 : You come at a good time. Squire Altennia is presently briefing me on the latest developments on the war front.
12296 : The main host of the Allied Forces' northern expedition now marches for Xarcabard.
12297 : My unit, the Carmine Swallows, has been recalled from furlough and will shortly depart to merge with them.
12298 : And that is why I come here today...to say my farewells. In this age of tumult, we know not when a meeting with loved ones may prove to be the last.
12299 : All will be well, surely. From the bits and pieces of rumor I've scavenged from Kingdom knights, the beastman force is in decline, and far from the menacing presence it once was.
12300 : The Griffin's nose for intelligence is as keen as ever, I see. But a mystery lies amidst this trend of decline, to be sure. Many an eyebrow has been raised over why a great many Orcs survived Tavnazia and now prowl the Northlands in force when other beastman units were nigh annihilated.
12301 : Tavnazia...? Annihilated...?
12302 : Oh, um...never mind that. 'Tis nothing of significance.
12303 : That will be quite enough, Altennia. Military secrets are more burden than privilege, and I would remind you not to afflict others with them.
12304 : V-Viscount Dieuffon... Please forgive me, sir. I shall practice more caution from now on.
12305 : It has been a while, %.
12306 : Word of your heroic feat against the notorious Bloodwing Horde out in Jugner has been battering my ears without cease.
12307 : Ah, would that I were there to behold the moment the Orcs turned tail and ran! Do you not agree, Altennia?
12308 : ...Eh? Oh, um, yes... % was magnificent in battle...so I'm told.
12309 : Hmmm...
12310 : Excenmille's welfare still weighs heavily on your mind, understandably.
12311 : ...Yes, sir.
12312 : We've yet to determine the location of the Cardinal Stags, 'tis true, but take heart, for the hour is still young. The current geomantic disturbance obstructs all means of communication, or so the scholars say. That would explain why we've been unable to regain contact with Count Aurchiat and his knights.
12313 : But under the count's astute leadership, 'tis like as not the Cardinal Stags already strike out for Xarcabard as we speak.
12314 : I, too, am inclined to optimism. Action before thought is the key to survival, and Excenmille has always held fervently to this belief.
12315 : Hahaha, the same was true of his father, lad. I'm pleased to hear the blood of House Aurchiat runs strongly still.
12316 : Hehehe... Thank you for your words, Viscount Dieuffon. You, too, Rholont. I shall try not to worry beyond reason.
12317 : But if I might ask, sir, to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?
12318 : Ah, yes. That had escaped my mind momentarily. I seek a word with Gissenne. Have you not seen her?
12319 : The captain? She left to have reserve chocobos issued for our unit's journey north, though naught was mentioned of location...
12320 : That is information enough. I've an inkling as to her whereabouts: Blackbird Lane.
12321 : Sir, there is time still before my unit's scheduled departure. Might I accompany you in the search for the captain?
12322 : Why, your company would be most welcome, Altennia.
12323 : Farewell, %, Rholont. Promise me you'll not do anything rash. Understood?
12324 : We promise! Farewell, Squire Altennia...
12325 : Oh, and should you perchance catch sight of Captain Gissenne, let her know to seek us out at Blackbird Lane.
12326 : Ma'am, yes, ma'am!
12327 : ...Egads!
12328 : It just occurred to me that I'm not familiar with Captain Gissenne's appearance...
12329 : However, a short while prior, I did observe a female knight of seemly demeanor conversing with the stable master by the corral.
12330 : She concerned herself with the number of sure-legged chocobos. Could that possibly have been the captain?
12331 : What's that? Looking for Captain Gissenne, are we? Well then, in that case...
12332 : Captain Gissenne! Visitors to see you, ma'am!
12333 : I don't believe we've met. What would you have of me?
12334 : The lieutenant wishes to have a word, you say?
12335 : %! Rholont told us we could find you here...
12336 : Ah, Captain! We've been searching for you.
12337 : Squire Altennia.
12338 : See that you express your thanks to % here.
12339 : I had a mind to go to Pikeman's Way to make arrangements for provisions, and am only here still because [he/she] came calling.
12340 : So the chocobos...
12341 : Aye, all the healthy mounts needed for the journey have been procured. They're being barded up as we speak.
12342 : That's wonderful!
12343 : That is welcome tidings indeed. For we may have need of them sooner than planned.
12344 : I presume 'tis for that reason you wish a word with me, Lieutenant.
12345 : Your perceptiveness serves you well, Captain Gissenne. Indeed, in the black of morn, a royal messenger delivered word of an enemy spotting--a large beastman host passing through Batallia Downs at speed.
12346 : Batallia Downs?
12347 : But has the region not already been swept clean of beastman presence? Elsewise, the enemy's objective is...
12348 : ...The sparsely defended rearguard of our Xarcabard-bound host, yes. As much as I fear it, few explanations make for a better fit.
12349 : ...Very well. A change of plans, then, for the Carmine Swallows. Departure shall be pushed forward to the earliest hour possible.
12350 : We shall strike out for Beaucedine and lie in wait to intercept the beastmen. Altennia, relay the news to all squires and have them make ready to march immediately.
12351 : Yes, ma'am!
12352 : %. You are a close acquaintance of Altennia, I take it, and a formidable soldier withal, if my eyes tell me true. The Carmine Swallows would have the honor of your company on this operation.
12353 : I, too, shall add my name to the petition. Can we rely upon your battle prowess at Beaucedine, %?
12354 : Participate in the ambush? You can count on me! Mayhap another time...
12355 : The Kingdom--nay, the entire Allied Forces--is indebted to you yet again. I thank you.
12356 : Let us converge directly at the glacier. Take all care and avoid unprofitable encounters with the enemy as you make your way.
12357 : We are sorry to hear that, truly... But I am sure you have your reasons, and I'll not question them.
12358 : I take my leave to make preparations of my own. We shall meet shortly, Captain Gissenne.
12359 : Understood.
12360 : The Knights of the Crimson Swallow have left for the Beaucedine Glacier. Will you not lend a hand to their cause, %? You needn't worry about Swiftwing Fortress. No ill shall befall it on my watch.
12361 : Access beyond the Victory Gate is not permitted at this time.
12362 : Why, Viscount Dieuffon and Squire Altennia!
12363 : Good day, Raustigne.
12364 : Oh, and % as well. I am pleased to see you again.
12365 : Please allow me to introduce Viscount Phillieulais S Dieuffon, lieutenant of the Royal Guards.
12366 : It is a pleasure to meet you, %. Hm...?
12367 : What in the name of Altana!?
12368 : You will stand down this instant! I will join that accursed First Regiment...  Let me join...in my sister's stead!
12369 : Milord, we beg you!
12370 : Please, you must return with us to the chateau!
12371 : Arrrgh! Stand down, I said! What part of that command do you two not understand!?
12372 : My dear Count Borel, what be the reason for this commotion?
12373 : This behavior befits not a person of your standing. If you do not compose yourself, the Temple Knights shall have no choice but to attend to you.
12374 : Phillieulais! You may be my childhood friend, but this matter concerns you not!
12375 : M-my beloved sister... I will not stand by and watch her march off to Garlaige Citadel!
12376 : I see...
12377 : Count Borel... Halver... I do not deny that His Majesty's counteroffensive strategy will be fraught with danger. But as Altennia's own flesh and blood, surely you understand her feelings, her desire to protect and serve her nation.
12378 : Thank you for your kind words, sir.
12379 : No harm will come to me, dear brother. You are aware of my proficiency with polearms better than any other.
12380 : B-but, Altennia...
12381 : Please forgive us, milord! We must now escort you back to the chateau!
12382 : Altennia! Nooooooooo!!!
12383 : Altenniaaaaaa!!!
12384 : I'm sorry, Halver...
12385 : Altennia... Despite my words to your brother, I must confess I am not entirely without apprehension.
12386 : The Carmine Swallows are the finest soldiers in the Kingdom, the elite among elite. I have the utmost confidence they will do more than hold their own against the enemy.
12387 : But never forget that soldiers pay for complacency with their lives.  The past few days have seen a substantial surge in beasthorde activity in the vicinity of San d'Oria. Keep your guard up at all times, Altennia, not only for your sake, but for Halver's as well.
12388 : I apologize for making you witness what just transpired, %.
12389 : It was my brother, Halver, who was escorted away kicking and screaming.
12390 : You see, a mission of critical import has been entrusted upon my regiment.
12391 : I am not authorized to disclose the details of the operation, but...
12392 : I fear I may not be able to see any of my loved ones again.
12393 : ... %...
12394 : There is something I must ask of you. Please hear me out.
12395 : If...
12396 : If I fall in battle...
12397 : I want you to look after Excenmille and the Young Griffons.
12398 : Ever since the tragic loss of his mother, I have been all he has.  Excenmille had closed himself off from all other elders... But miraculously, he has taken to you, %.
12399 : There is no other I can depend on.
12400 : Can I ask this of you, if I should not return?
12401 : Will you take care of the Young Griffons? I promise! Be strong, Altennia!
12402 : I-I'm sorry... I wonder what madness came over me...
12403 : You are absolutely right. Just the thought of leaving the children behind is more than I can bear...
12404 : Thank you, %, for bringing me back to my senses.
12405 : This means more to me than you could ever imagine. Thank you, %.
12406 : Now I can charge into battle under the Carmine Swallow banner without any regret.
12407 : The time for departure has come.
12408 : Before I leave, there is something you should know.
12409 : (This concerns Temple Knight Darvylle, whom you say was conversing with the Orc escapee.)
12410 : (Darvylle has been observed absent on numerous occasions to tend to matters of an unknown nature.)
12411 : (I sense treachery at play, %. It would be prudent to not let that one out of your sight.)
12412 : Be well, %. I hope we meet again.
12413 : I must go now. Thank you, %. I know the Young Griffons are in good hands.
12414 : Welcome back from your mission! Word of your accomplishments in the field has reached all ears at headquarters!
12415 : Your trouncing of bloodthirsty Orcs has brought honor to the Young Griffons!
12416 : Oh, I must inform you, the War Council scheduled for today has been postponed, due to an emergency change-of-mind by the captain.
12417 : Both the captain and lieutenant have departed on a scouting expedition of Gigas activity on Gerlvan Isle.
12418 : You are unaware of this undertaking by the Young Griffons?
12419 : It is the continuation of an expedition that was commenced prior to your enlistment.
12420 : What? A status report of the expedition, you say?
12421 : Engineer Bistillot!!!
12422 : <Sigh> Sentinel Rholont, how many times must I remind you that shouting is completely unnecessary from this distance?
12423 : Let's see...  By calculating their progress based on a report from the previous journey, I assume they have now arrived and commenced gathering information at Vunkerl Inlet.
12424 : With but the two of them, I wonder if everything is proceeding according to plan...
12425 : You see, during the previous expedition, we encountered a hulking, grey Gigas. Well...if truth be told, we caught but a glimpse of the monstrous creature from afar. But that was enough to cause our ranks to crumble into disarray. The undignified way in which we reacted still remains a bitter memory for the Young Griffons...
12426 : After such an episode, even a foolhardy Elvaan like the captain would not act rashly should he again encounter that Gigas.
12427 : But knowing the captain, there is the possibility he has gone back to seek the very same grey Gigas...to redeem himself.
12428 : It was near the bridge in Vunkerl Inlet where we saw the Gigas in question. Chances are it is there you will find the captain and lieutenant.
12429 : The captain and lieutenant are currently scouting Gigas activity at Vunkerl Inlet.
12430 : It was near the bridge there that we sighted the grey Gigas during the previous expedition.
12431 : I had best return to guard duty... Nothing to report!
12432 : %! Welcome back from your mission!
12433 : However, I am afraid there is no time for revelry.  Engineer Bistillot has called an emergency meeting. The captain himself is due to arrive shortly.
12434 : Bistillot! What is the meaning of this?
12435 : I trust you had good reason to call this meeting without my prior consent.
12436 : Naturally, Captain Excenmille.
12437 : I have called this meeting to report information obtained via the linkpearls we planted to eavesdr--
12438 : H-hold it there, Bistillot!
12439 : % does not yet know the % were fitted with linkpearls...
12440 : E-Excenmille!
12441 : Uh-oh...
12442 : You just speared your own foot...
12443 : The information was obtained via the %--er, linkpearl planted on the captain's father.
12444 : Altennia's regiment was ambushed by Orcs in Jugner Forest.
12445 : What!?
12446 : Wh-what has become of Altennia...?
12447 : Of Squire Altennia, I do not know... However, rumor of the regiment's demise runs rampant among the knights.
12448 : B-Bistillot, is there naught else you have learned?
12449 : (Buzz...crackle...buzz...)
12450 : ...!? A new transmission... Quiet, everyone.
12451 : There is something coming from the linkpearl planted on Temple Knight Darvylle....
12452 : (Buzz...fizz...crackle...)
12453 : Why, my dear Count Bifrons... To what do I owe the pleasure of your presence?
12454 : Spare me your hollow formalities, Zogbog. You will report the current situation to me--without garnish.
12455 : A-as you command, m'lord...
12456 : With the invaluable aid of Temple Knight Darvylle, who stands here before you, not only have we successfully eliminated General Mouchand of the Temple Knights, but we were also able to free our captured Orcish brethren from the clutches of the Elvaan.
12457 : And prior to your arrival, m'lord, intelligence supplied by Darvylle led to the successful ambush of an entire regiment of San d'Orian knights.
12458 : Hm. I expected no less.
12459 : Now, Temple Knight Darvylle, was it?  I would know why a person of your standing would be motivated to...betray your own kind?
12460 : ...
12461 : Hahaha! You need not answer. War has no place for righteous types, and your motivation interests me not. But an Orc collaborating with an Elvaan makes for a curious sight indeed. As you were.
12462 : Grrr... He thinks much too highly of himself.
12463 : Temple Knight Darvylle...is conspiring with the Beastman Confederate?
12464 : Th-this does not bode well!
12465 : What is it, Bistillot?
12466 : The assassination of General Mouchand, the breakout of the Orc captives, and the ambush on Altennia's regiment...can all be traced back to one man...
12467 : Temple Knight Darvylle--he has been leaking military secrets to the Orcs!
12468 : Zogbog... So that is the name of the glib-tongued Orc with whom we crossed swords in Jugner Forest.
12469 : Hush! Their conversation continues...
12470 : (Zogbog. There is but one more thing.)
12471 : (The new captive, the squire called Altennia...)
12472 : (She knows of my involvement in this scheme.)
12473 : (It would be most...inconvenient if she were to return to San d'Oria and spread lies of the role I played. I trust you understand what is required.)
12474 : ...!?
12475 : D-does this mean Squire Altennia is still alive!?
12476 : From what I gather of that transmission, Squire Altennia survived the ambush and is now a captive in the hands of the Orcs.
12477 : She has not yet come to harm, but...
12478 : Darvylle has expressly stated his intent to...to...
12479 : Altennia!
12480 : Excenmille, wait!
12481 : Bistillot, Rholont! The elders must be informed of this most sinister plot!
12482 : Altennia's life is at stake. We have no choice but to confess regarding the %.
12483 : I will catch up to Excenmille.
12484 : Come with me, %.
12485 : As you command, sir!
12486 : We have reason to believe the Orcs are encamped in Jugner Forest.
12487 : In all likelihood, they will be in the southern region of Jugner Forest, not far from La Vaule.
12488 : Be warned!
12489 : This fiendish group of Orcs was able to take even the Royal Knights unawares. You must practice the highest degree of caution on this mission.
12490 : Lieutenant! %! We pray for Squire Altennia's safe return!
12491 : Let us make haste, %!
12492 : %! Please return Squire Altennia safely to us!
12493 : The Orcish encampment should be in the southern region of Jugner Forest, not far from La Vaule.
12494 : %, we are pleased to see you returned! The captain awaits!
12495 : Upon learning the true nature of the linkpearls, Iron Ram Captain Rongelouts gave us a right royal scolding. But, it is a small price to pay to have Squire Altennia back safe and sound.
12496 : %!
12497 : Both Rahal and Bistillot are absent today, most likely on the receiving end of disciplinary action from the elders for the %...
12498 : Me? I stole off and came here, why need you ask?
12499 : Excenmille.
12500 : Who seeks Captain Excenmille of the Young Griffons? Eek! Lieutenant Dieuffon and Altennia!
12501 : Your father has been looking for you, Excenmille.
12502 : ...
12503 : %, Alphonimile also bid me tell you he wishes the pleasure of your audience at your earliest convenience.
12504 : I understand you are responsible for Altennia still being with us this day. You have my thanks.
12505 : Now, I must return to duty.
12506 : Altennia, you are not to overexert yourself until further notice. This is an order.
12507 : Thank you, Lieutenant Dieuffon.
12508 : Shall we go see your father now, Excenmille?
12509 : Altennia, are your wounds healed?
12510 : Thank you for your concern, sir. I am well.
12511 : %, I thank you for coming.
12512 : I am eternally indebted to you for saving both Excenmille and Altennia.
12513 : Your display of valor in the face of our ferocious Orcish foe would inspire even the best of our knights.
12514 : But now, to the heart of the matter.  Temple Knight Darvylle--I believe the name is more than familiar to you.
12515 : He aligns himself with the Eastern Faction--dissidents who conspire to restore the lost East San d'Oria of old... They are remnants from the age of a violent civil war that split our fair Kingdom in two.
12516 : Approximately ten years ago, the Eastern Faction masterminded the murder of King Grantieul, employing the infamous Orc, Doggvdegg, to carry out the unspeakable deed.
12517 : And now, they have once again entered into an unholy alliance with the Orcs, plotting to extinguish the life of King Destin.
12518 : But unlike ten years ago, we were able to unveil this most wicked conspiracy with the Beastman Confederate, and confirm the role played by Darvylle.
12519 : Only with your valiant efforts were we able to foil their plans. The entire Kingdom is in your debt.
12520 : Neither words nor gifts could ever sufficiently show my feelings of gratitude, but please, accept this.
12521 : F-Father...
12522 : Yes, my son. What is it?
12523 : I beg your permission to partake in the next expedition.
12524 : E-Excenmille!
12525 : Excenmille... Why do you wish this?
12526 : I-I saw them, Father, those who killed Mother... The Orcs at Jugner Forest led by Doggvdegg, the ones who laid siege to San d'Oria...  I-it was them...
12527 : ...!
12528 : Blinded by rage, I thought of giving pursuit, caring not for my life if I could but get revenge.
12529 : But...
12530 : I became...petrified.
12531 : I felt so powerless...
12532 : I want the strength, courage, and wisdom to stand against even the fiercest enemies!
12533 : I implore you, Father! Take me on the next expedition!
12534 : I shall ask you but once more. Is this your true wish?
12535 : I swear on my honor as a Young Griffon! Take me with you!
12536 : Then so be it. We shall further discuss this back at the estate.
12537 : %, thank you again for protecting my son.
12538 : Phew... Groveling to Father becomes me not.
12539 : Excenmille, what were you thinking!?
12540 : You are no ordinary child--that much I have ascertained.
12541 : With your swordsmanship, even a place with the Royal Knights would not be far-fetched...
12542 : But, fighting in battle is--
12543 : Altennia, you know my father well.
12544 : He is a man of honor, and will not go back on his word.
12545 : Excenmille...
12546 : Altennia, where are you!? Your wounds... You must remain in bed until you are healed completely!
12547 : <Pant, gasp...> H-Halver! S-slow down!
12548 : H-Halver!? Some may consider it a blessing to have such a doting brother, but...
12549 : Thank you for everything, %! Now, if you would excuse me...
12550 : You there! Did my sister Altennia not pass through here?
12551 : A-Altennia?  Um...uh... %?
12552 : What will you do? Point east. Point west.
12553 : Is that so? I thank you. You are truly a fine Young Griffon!
12554 : Altenniaaaaaa!
12555 : ...
12556 : I have never before witnessed such a touching display of brotherly love...
12557 : And I must concur... % truly is a fine Young Griffon.
12558 : Hmph!
12559 : %! I trust our fine Young Griffon has not forgotten cleaning detail!
12560 : Conspiring with those young maggots to plant an eavesdropping device on a superior officer!? Absolutely unforgivable!
12561 : Hmph... Considering the outcome, I shall pardon your transgression just this once.
12562 : A short while prior, I observed a female knight of seemly demeanor conversing with the stable master by the corral.
12563 : She concerned herself with the number of sure-legged chocobos. Could that possibly have been Captain Gissenne?

12598 : Who wants to know...? Oh, it's Taurean Master Caster Pattna-Ottna! What are you doing here!?
12599 : Now that's an interesting story. You see, I was sentaru here to request Royal Knight reinforcements...
12600 : I come before you to formally requestaru Royal Knight reinforcements for Fort Karugo-Narugo.
12601 : Our beleaguered federation humbly-wumbly begs for your aid...
12602 : I understand your situation, and I would dearly love to be of assistance.
12603 : However, the logistics involved in preparing troops for cross-continent travel...
12604 : I am afraid it would be most impossible to find a unit capable of undertaking the journey at such short notice.
12605 : General Cousseraux. If I may be so bold, I believe my own unit would not be incapable of making such a trek...
12606 : Out of the question! Your troops have an important mission before them.
12607 : I will abide no unnecessary impediments to our plans for the Sauromugue Champaign.
12608 : I hope you understand my position, Master Caster.
12609 : Please inform your Warlock Warlord that the Royal Knights will do what they can. However, nothing can be promised at this time.
12610 : ...
12611 : And that was the endy-wend of that.
12612 : Huh... Um, actually, isn't this kind of talk confidential or something?
12613 : It's no secretaru. And I appreciate having a shoulder to gripey-wipe on.
12614 : I'm afraid the Elvaan bear a grudge for the time we ruled the continent--their pride preventarus them from lending us the help we need.
12615 : ...
12616 : Sir Joseaneaut, the Temple Knight I spoke of, is currently staying in Squire Alley. Let us be on our way...
12617 : Rachemace! How glad I am to see you safely returned. You were reported as missing by your unit.
12618 : And who might your companions be?
12619 : These fine individuals are citizens of Windurst that extricated me from a rather harrowing predicament.
12620 : So honest and humble...
12621 : Tihl, give it a rrrest...
12622 : Well then, I offer up my most heartfelt gratitude. May the Goddess watch over you all...
12623 : Joseaneaut, I actually come to you with an urgent request. Would you by any chance be able to decipher this Yagudo rope message?
12624 : A rope message? Perhaps my Goblin friend will have some insight. Leada! Could you take a look at this?
12625 : A gold piece for the guide. A gold piece for the Goblin.
12626 : Can you decipher these knots? It appears to be some sort of Yagudo code...
12627 : Leada is as bright as a box of brass tacks. Piece of crab cake. One gold beastcoin each.
12628 : Very well, but allow me to collect the fee a little later. It seems our guests are in a hurry.
12629 : You got no business sense, Josea. Well, I'll get my gold one way or another. Let's see this rope...
12630 : Hmm...hmm? Somethin' about magic gear?
12631 : Magical equipment?
12632 : Gear that makes magic useless. The Yagudo have made some, it says.
12633 : The Yagudo have developed equipment that renders magic ineffective!?
12634 : Magic-resistant armor? San d'Oria also once attempted to create such equipment in our own conflict with Windurst... Have the Yagudo been successful where our artisans have failed!?
12635 : There's more. Manifest, lead us to the city. Windurst...will fall.
12636 : Windurst will fall? A prophecy, mayhap?
12637 : Ugh, gives me the chills...
12638 : This is ominous news. It seems those Royal Knight reinforcements are even more vital than our Tarutaru friends anticipated...
12639 : Reinforcements? What talk is this?
12640 : It seems a request was made recently...
12641 : And General Cousseraux refused this request? How callous...
12642 : Joseaneaut. I mean to somehow convince the general to reconsider his decision to lend troops to our allies.
12643 : And if it means aiding my newfound saviors, I will travel to Windurst alone, at the cost of my knighthood...
12644 : Though I hold little sway in military matters, I shall add my voice to your plea.
12645 : And I think it best that you return to Windurst. It will not help our cause if we are thought part of some Tarutaru conspiracy.
12646 : I'll never understand politics...
12647 : One moment. Please accept this % as a token of my gratitude. May it alleviate some of the cost of your journey.
12648 : Looks like your nose for trrrouble landed us right in the thick of it, Tihl.
12649 : Is Windurst going to come through this okay, you think? Maybe I should be making plans to board the next ship out...
12650 : Bite your tongue. Magic-rrresistant armor isn't gonna help the Yagudo against Mithran blades and arrows!
12651 : I guess you're rrright. Hmm, I wonder if Rachemace and his friar buddy will be alright.
12652 : I'm sure they'll be fine. I mean, how could anyone rrresist the charms of two such handsome lads?
12653 : Those Royal Knights are a stubborn lot according to the Tarutaru. I hear they put people to the sword for stepping out of line.
12654 : P-put them to the sword!? But that would be such a waste!
12655 : We gotta hurry back to Karugo-Narugo and rrreport to the boss!
12656 : Yeah, about time we were heading out. We'll see you there, %!
12657 : Great Altana, grant your mercy to all your children...
12658 : There is no response to your knocking.
12659 : Ho there! % from fair Windurst, are you not? Well met!
12660 : No doubt your legs are weary from the road, but I have orders to escort you to the castle at once. All parties have assembled, and there is much that needs be discussed.
12661 : ...As has been confirmed by the Kingdom's elite scouts...
12662 : (Ah, %, I was wondering when you'd show up! Quickly, over here...the meeting's already begun!)
12663 : And who might this [gentleman/lady] be?
12664 : A mercenary under our command. Pardon the interruption. Please continue.
12665 : An ally of Windurst. Pardon the interruption. Please continue.
12666 : (The stately looking fellow doing all the talking is Valaineral R Davilles, Captain of the San d'Orrrian Royal Guards. He's brrriefing all officers on the tactical situation as it currently stands.)
12667 : Hosts from each of the three beastman nations--Orc, Quadav, and Yagudo--are mobilizing in the north even as we speak. We have every reason to believe that they do so at the behest of the Shadow Lord himself.
12668 : The Confederate has divided their forces between the Tavnazian and Valdeaunian fronts. Both are amassing resources and manpower, girding themselves for a full-scale offensive on our lands.
12669 : Any further delay will mean our certain destruction.
12670 : Thusly, we move at once. We march on Valdeaunia and commence the siege of Castle Zvahl forthwith.
12671 : Our first objective will be to establish position in Xarcabard and the Beaucedine Glacier. From there, we will surround Castle Zvahl and strike at the heart of our foe.
12672 : Commanders, ready your troops for the battle of their lives. We leave for Valdeaunia on the morrow.
12673 : A detailed briefing will be held upon our arrival.
12674 : In closing, a word to all of you.
12675 : I stand here, and see before me Windurstians, Bastokers, and San d'Orians. I see men and women who, in days past, might once have crossed swords as enemies.
12676 : To see you today, united under one banner for the glory of the Goddess, fills me with pride such as I have never known.
12677 : The battle will be arduous, the enemy unyielding. But with your courage and valor, Altana's children will live to see a brighter day. Dismissed!
12678 : Warlock Warlord, sir!
12679 : An urgentaru transmission has just come in from the Leonian War Warlocks! P-p-please, takey-wake a listen!
12680 : Master Caster Doron-Fulun of the Leonian War Warlocks reportaruing, Warlock Warlord sir! I have grave news!
12681 : This is Robel-Akbel. Speak.
12682 : Our scouts justaru returned from Castle Zvahl, and-- Wh-wh-what the--? What are you doing!? L-l-let go of me!!! Noooooooooooo!!!
12684 : ... Have we...lostaru him?
12685 : <...>
12686 : Ohohohohoho!
12687 : Be quiet for a spell, and listen good and well.
12688 : (That voice...!?)
12689 : As you march unwittingly toward the Shadow Lord's front door, the enemy has stealthily prepared another, secret corps.
12690 : What's more, this second army has been set in motion. A direct assault on Windurst, would appear to be their notion.
12691 : Ten thousand or more, by my rough count. No matter how you slice it, a formidable amount.
12692 : What!?
12693 : I might have handled them on my own, if I weren't stuck with your hapless War Warlocks to chaperone.
12694 : Robel-Akbel. Amend your plans on the double, or watch as the Federation is reduced to so much rubble!
12695 : Your report is appreciated, Professor. That was exactly the information I needed to plot the necessary countermeasures.
12696 : The Allied Forces will proceed for Valdeaunia as scheduled. You and the Leonians are to join us there.
12697 : Yes, I suppose I can do as you say. Though I'll trust you not to get in my way! Ohohohohoho!
12698 : And so it begins...
12699 : Lehko! Send word to the Federation at once.
12700 : Their numbers exceed our estimates. You are to take command of the Cobras and stave the enemy off at Karugo-Narugo.
12701 : Understood.
12702 : My esteemed Robel-Akbel, whatever is the commotion?
12703 : Excuse my discourtesy, Lord Valaineral. It appears that the Federation will have some unexpected guests. I've ordered Lehko and the Cobra Mercenaries back to the fort.
12704 : Guests, you say?
12705 : ...I see. Once you've regaled them properly, make haste to join us in the north. The battle will not be won without your aid.
12706 : Yes, milord.
12707 : Well, Romaa, %...you heard the Warlock Warlord. We'd best head back to make preparrrations for the banquet.
12708 : But before that... Well, it would be the height of rrrudeness to show up at the party empty-handed, don't you think?
12709 : What say we bring back a prrresent to liven up the festivities a tad?
12710 : A present, you say...?
12711 : Hehehe... Don't worry, I have just the thing in mind. A few hours ago, on the way to the briefing, I came across an Allied supply carrravan transporting a stockpile of arms.
12712 : A quick peek inside the wagon turned up some items of particular interrrest: % and %...
12713 : I figurrre they wouldn't miss a few of them...what do you think?
12714 : You're not suggesting that we steal from the Allied arrrsenal!?
12715 : Steal...? Hardly! As full-fledged members of the Allied Forces, we have as much right to these supplies as anyone! Why leave them to collect dust in an armory somewhere when we could put them to so much better use, no?
12716 : I'm not so surrre about this one...
12717 : Come on, have I ever led you astrrray? Trust me...I have a plan.
12718 : Remember our recent skirmish? It was that magic-resistant armor the beastmen were wearing that proved so trrroublesome.
12719 : If we could somehow use the % and % to produce ammunition that could pierce through their protection...
12720 : We could blast their magic armor right off, and rrrender them all but defenseless before they even know what's hit them!
12721 : Ever the rrresourceful one, aren't you, Lehko? Fine. You can take responsibility when Valaineral comes for our heads!
12722 : Hahaha...when our plan wins us a rrrousing victory at Karugo-Narugo, he's more likely to award us medals of honor!
12723 : All right! First, to convince that stern-looking gentleman over there of the rrrighteousness of our cause...
12724 : (All right, I'm counting on you, %! A few arrrtful words, and the % and % will be ours!)
12725 : A moment of your time, good sir!
12726 : Yes? I'm a busy man. State your business, then begone with you.
12727 : Oh, t'will only be a second. I couldn't help but notice the % and % you were carrying just before...
12728 : Yes? What of them? They are reserve armaments that we were transporting to our secret cache. Can't very well leave such dangerous materials lying about the street, after all.
12729 : Oh, but certainly! I can see that you are most prrrudent in your duties! But this cache you speak of...might I inquire as to its whereabouts?
12730 : <Ahem> Why, ah--thank you, kind sir. I most certainly endeavor to be! As for the stockpile, we recently relocated it to--
12731 : ...Wait a minute. I've not seen your faces before. Are you truly soldiers of the Allied Forces? State your affiliation!
12732 : We fight for... The War Warlocks. The Mithra Mercenaries. The Future Fighters.
12733 : I see... And just what sort of outfit might that be?
12734 : Our duties are... To slay our foes with magic. To cut down enemies with our swords. To travel through time.
12735 : Is that so...? And you say that you serve the Allied Forces of Altana?
12736 : You serve the Allied Forces? Our lives for the Goddess! Yes, we're giving our all. Eh, more or less.
12737 : I ask you, how do you suppose this war will end?
12738 : How will the Great War end?  The Allied Forces will triumph! The Beastman Confederate will prevail. How should I know?
12739 : Indeed...and what do you feel holds the key to this conflict?
12740 : The key to the conflict is... Robel-Akbel's true identity. The Shadow Lord's true identity. Our visitor from the future.
12741 : Incidentally, why is it that you seek the % and %?
12742 : Why do you need the supplies? To save Windurst! To save the world! To save our future!
12743 : Very well, then. I can see that you are loyal servants of Altana. Forgive me for having doubted you. One can never be too careful these days...
12744 : The supplies have been moved to [/East Ronfaure/Jugner Forest/La Vaule] in preparation for any regional skirmishes that may arise. You are welcome to whatever you deem necessary for your cause.
12745 : Oh, and I'd be remiss not to tell you that they've been well hidden. Buried, actually. It wouldn't do to have them discovered by beastman curs, after all.
12746 : ...?
12747 : Do you take me for a fool!? Begone, before I have you locked up like the rogues you are!
12748 : Many thanks, loyal soldier! May the Goddess be with you!
12749 : Well, %, it looks like we're making a detour to [/East Ronfaure/Jugner Forest/La Vaule]!
12750 : Very well. I shall return to the fort and rrready our defenses.
12751 : Yes, by all means. Let us make haste, %. We mustn't be late for the party!
12752 : We've relocated the supplies to [/East Ronfaure/Jugner Forest/La Vaule]. Should you deem them necessary to your cause, you are welcome to them.
12753 : I have been stationed here to watch over the Allied Forces' supply of armaments. Move along, and keep your hands where they belong.
12754 : Dialogue debug: # points.
12755 : If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess % and have a high enough job level.
12756 : You can rent a chocobo for # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
12757 : You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.
12758 : If you still want one, it will cost you # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
12759 : Do you wish to rent a chocobo? Yes, I do. No, thank you.
12760 : You don't have enough gil.
12761 : You cannot obtain the %. Come back after sorting your inventory.
12762 : Would you be so kind as to deliver her to [the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?
12763 : Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo. First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of %.
12764 : Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of # Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have # Allied Notes.
12765 : Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
12766 : %, if I'm not mistaken. We appreciate your assistance in the expansion of our provision storehouses.
12767 : Your chocobo is already saddled up and loaded with the construction materials. To which stronghold will you be delivering?
12768 : Deliver to which stronghold? East Ronfaure. Jugner Forest. Vunkerl Inlet. Batallia Downs. I need to replan.
12769 : Deliver to which stronghold? North Gustaberg. Grauberg. Pashhow Marshlands. Rolanberry Fields. I need to replan.
12770 : Deliver to which stronghold? West Sarutabaruta. Fort Karugo-Narugo. Meriphataud Mountains. Sauromugue Champaign. I need to replan.
12771 : Our troops at the stronghold in [East Ronfaure/Jugner Forest/Vunkerl Inlet/Batallia Downs] will be informed of your coming. Luck ride with you!
12772 : Our troops at the stronghold in [North Gustaberg/Grauberg/Pashhow Marshlands/Rolanberry Fields] will be informed of your coming. Luck ride with you!
12773 : Our troops at the stronghold in [West Sarutabaruta/Fort Karugo-Narugo/Meriphataud Mountains/Sauromugue Champaign] will be informed of your coming. Luck ride with you!
12774 : I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with %. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?
12775 : Ah, one of the Knights of the Iron Ram.
12776 : The captain informed me that you would be along soon.
12777 : What can I assist you with? What is the Allied Campaign? What are campaign operations? What are freelances? Nothing.
12778 : The Allied Campaign is the comprehensive name given to the various operations carried out by the Forces of Altana against the Beastman Confederate.
12779 : As a reward for the nation that contributes the most in regaining control of an area occupied by the beastmen, dominion is granted for a short period of time.
12780 : Arbitration of the campaign has been bestowed upon Jeuno, since the Duchy has renounced all claims to any lands seized by their army.
12781 : The leaders of Jeuno were first to recognize that it would be no small feat to convince the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria to put aside all past differences and join in arms against a common foe.
12782 : And that is why the Duchy felt it necessary to motivate the three armies by offering rewards for their performance on the battlefield.
12783 : In other words, by simply battling our archenemies, the Orcish Horde, San d'Oria can expand its influence across the region, increasing our crystal and resource supplies, and thus further strengthening the Kingdom.
12784 : As a provisionary member of the Knights of the Iron Ram, the bulk of your duties will entail participation in various campaign operations.
12785 : Campaign operations, also known as Campaign Ops, is the term used for the various small-scale missions authorized by the Allied War Council.
12786 : When an operation is successfully completed, the nation is granted a monetary sum, paid by the Repositorium--an international bank funded by the four nations of Mindartia and Quon, and located in Jeuno.
12787 : To put it bluntly, the harder you work, the more prosperous your regiment...and the Kingdom becomes.
12788 : As for you, participation in operations will earn you Allied Notes, which can be spent on various items and equipment. Also, the more successful you are in your duties, the more important the missions you are offered will become.
12789 : Once you are ready to join an operation, speak with Sir Rasdinice and he will assist you.
12790 : Good luck, %. The future of the Kingdom rides on your bravery and honor.
12791 : Excellent! You show much promise, %. Now let me explain to you the intricacies of the Allied Campaign map, and you shall be on your way.
12792 : To view the campaign map, first select Region Info, and then Campaign.
12793 : The sword indicates areas where battles are currently being waged.
12794 : If you are not signed up for any operations, then hurry to the frontlines and help lead your fellow knights to victory!
12795 : The heroism gauge indicates locations where the battles have become quite heated. Who knows what may occur in an area with a full gauge?
12796 : That is all. If you ever feel the need to review this information once again, come speak with me at any time.
12797 : Freelances is the collective term given to special units and individuals who have not pledged their allegiance to a single nation.
12798 : While not necessarily our enemies, these groups do not fall under control of the Allied Forces, preferring to choose their battles. Heroes for hire, you could say.
12799 : However, their prowess on the battlefield is not to be underestimated.
12800 : If you happen to come across one of these freelances in your journeys, consider it your duty as a Knight of the Iron Ram to at least attempt to recruit their services. Perhaps your true heart and iron will will lure them to our side.
12801 : Might you be seeking employment with the San d'Orian military? If that is the case, then speak with Sir Mainchelite.
12802 : Might you be seeking employment with the San d'Orian military? If that is the case, you must first speak with Lady Houilloumie and renounce all ties with your current nation of employment.
12803 : You discover and collect a suspicious object.
12804 : You have met your quota!
12805 : Danger!
12806 : This NPC will not be used in the game.
12807 : In the game Mr. F's NPCs will be used at the start an end of the missions.
12808 : Quit mission? Yeah. No.
12809 : Cleared userwork.
12810 : Set difficulty. Rank 1. Rank 2. Rank 3. Endless Debug Hell.
12811 : Rank 1 quota: 1 object.
12812 : Rank 2 quota: 3 objects.
12813 : Rank 3 quota: 5 objects.
12814 : Endless: No end to garbage.
12815 : Ready......GARBAGE!
12816 : You have met your quota. Good job, garbage [boy/chick]!
12817 : Salutations, I am Campaign Evaluation Official Alfred. How might I be of assistance?
12818 : Greetings, I am Campaign Evaluation Official Annabelle. How can I help you today?
12819 : Hello, I'm Campaign Evaluation Official Llewellyn. How can I help you today?
12820 : What do you require? Nothing. An evaluation. Info on the duration of my medal. An overview of evaluations. Info on medals. Info on the benefits of medals. Info on evaluation process.
12821 : Evaluations are conducted on all participants of the Allied Campaign. Individual data is collected by the Allied War Council from various sources, such as Campaign Arbiters and the leaders of the armies in which the soldiers serve. This data is then used to determine whether or not a decoration is to be conferred.
12822 : Some of the areas that are considered in this evaluation are performance in campaign operations, as well as valor shown during campaign battles.
12823 : The more an individual is decorated, the more responsibility he or she will be given within the Allied Forces. And with more responsibility comes the promise of larger compensation in exchange for services.
12824 : However, the prestige that accompanies the medals also carries with it a great weight. To maintain one's status, he or she must continue to exceed previous expectations. If a soldier fails to fulfill the duties that are required of all those who possess a certain medal, then the Allied War Council will be forced to confiscate that decoration.
12825 : To put it simply, only those who fight with fervor and precision...only those who put the glory of the Allied Campaign above all else...will be allowed to reap the benefits that come with victory.
12826 : If you wish to learn more of the Allied Campaign, please speak with [/Lady Fiaudie/Centurion Aurelius/Kolin-Olin].
12827 : There are two more things of note.
12828 : Once an evaluation has been requested, the Allied War Council will require [five days/one hour] (Earth time) to come to a conclusion.
12829 : During that time, individuals may join as many operations or battles as they wish, but will only be considered for a single medal.
12830 : However, the same rules apply for an inadequate performance. No matter how low one scores, the maximum number of decorations that can be confiscated is one.
12831 : Also, individuals must not forget that all medals come with expiration dates. While an extremely unorthodox practice, this measure was deemed necessary to prevent the forgery of allied decorations by those persons with dubious intentions.
12832 : Upon conferral, all medals are marked with a magical seal that dissipates after a period of thirty days (Earth time). Once the seal has vanished, the medal will become void and its owner will no longer be able to participate in campaign operations or battles, among other things.
12833 : It is highly recommended that you keep track of the time remaining on your medal and apply for evaluations regularly.
12834 : Is there anything else you wish to ask?
12835 : Campaign medals are official rewards given to those individuals who perform exemplary deeds for the Allied Forces.
12836 : These decorations are internationally recognized as symbols of strength, loyalty, and honor. They not only garner respect, but provide their bearers with privileges not offered civilians.
12837 : Those who have been decorated with the more prestigious medals will also be highly regarded among their army's ranks, and thus entrusted with increasingly difficult and important missions.
12838 : On the other hand, disloyalty to one's nation is highly frowned upon. If, for any reason, an individual wishes to leave their current army of employment and pledge allegiance to another, they will be required to return their two most distinguished medals.
12839 : To the point, are we? Very well, I shall list the merits those in the possession of medals may receive.
12840 : Firstly, the more prestigious an individual's medal, the more weight [his/her] army's [/curate/supply commander/Morale Manager] will grant [his/her] opinion.
12841 : Secondly, the types of Campaign Ops available to an individual will increase based on the medals that [he/she] has in [his/her] possession. More advanced operations will earn participants increased amounts of EXP and Allied Notes, as well as have a heavier influence on performance evaluations.
12842 : Thirdly, benefits received during campaign battles will vary depending on the variety of medals an individual carries. The better the medals, the larger the opportunity to earn EXP, Allied Notes, and reputation. The selection of temporary items available for purchase will also improve.
12843 : However, the more prestigious the medal, the more that will be expected of its bearer. The Campaign Arbiters will not go easy on those who have already proven themselves.
12844 : Understood?
12845 : Greetings, %. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is in # day[/s].
12846 : Greetings, %. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is in # hour[/s].
12847 : Greetings, %. My ledger states that the earliest you can apply for an evaluation is...any moment now.
12848 : Is there something I can help you with in the meantime?
12849 : Greetings, soldier. Unfortunately, I cannot authorize the evaluations of those individuals who have not pledged their allegiance to this nation's forces.
12850 : Understood. I shall prepare the proper documents and deliver them to the Allied War Council Evaluation Board in Jeuno.
12851 : ......
12852 : Congratulations, %! Your recent performance has been evaluated, and the Allied War Council has deemed you worthy of a new medal!
12853 : Accept the honors? Yes. No.
12854 : Are you sure? Yes. No.
12855 : One moment, please, while I prepare your award.
12856 : That will be enough, officer. I shall complete the ceremony.
12857 : [Sir/Lady] %, I commend you on your service to the Kingdom!
12858 : But remember, as you accept this %, the path before you grows ever more perilous. Succumb not to the evils of lethargy, lest you find yourself stripped bare of your past honors.
12859 : That will be enough. I'll take it from here, soldier.
12860 : Ahem! %, for exemplary service to the Republic of Bastok, I present you with the %! Dismissed!
12861 : ... Why are you still here, soldier!? There are beastmen to be pummeled! Now, march!
12862 : Hold on a minute. I'll take it from herrre.
12863 : %! ... ... Good work. Here's your %.
12864 : Oh, and don't go getting the wrrrong idea. The reason you're wearing that medal isn't because you are a fine soldier, it's because you're backed by the best damn unit in the Federation. Dismissed!
12865 : That is all. Please note that you will not be eligible for another evaluation for [five days/one hour] (Earth time). Good luck, %.
12866 : Are you certain, %? You know there is no need to be humble.
12867 : Or perhaps you have forgotten that it doesn't matter how much you contribute to the Allied Campaign, you can only receive one medal per evaluation.
12868 : I cannot force you to accept the medal, but...
12869 : While the Allied War Council was pleased with your work, it was determined that your performance did not warrant the conferral of further decoration.
12870 : You still have # day[/s] (Earth time) until your current campaign medal expires.
12871 : Your current campaign medal will expire in less than a day (Earth time).
12872 : Your current campaign medal has already expired.
12873 : Would you like to continue this month's evaluation in a further attempt to receive the next medal, or would you rather end the evaluation and maintain your current honors?
12874 : End the evaluation? Yes. No.
12875 : Excellent. Speak with me again when you are ready to submit your next application. Good luck, %.
12876 : By ending the evaluation, you will have accepted the war council's decision to maintain your current rank, and be granted another thirty-day seal on your current medal.
12877 : However, any work you have done during the past evaluation period towards the procurement of the next medal will become null and void.
12878 : Please consider carefully your options before making this important decision.
12879 : Are you absolutely sure? Yes. No.
12880 : Done. Your medal has been given a new magic seal.
12881 : Please note that you will be eligible for your next evaluation in [five days/one hour] (Earth time).
12882 : ...... I am sorry, %, but the war council was not at all pleased with your performance, and has deemed you unworthy of your highest-ranking medal.
12883 : It shall be confiscated the moment its magic seal expires.
12884 : You have two choices left, %. You may either accept the council's decision, or, if your medal's seal still holds, you may continue your efforts to improve your evaluation.
12885 : It retains # day[/s] (Earth time) of power.
12886 : However, it retains less than a day's power (Earth time).
12887 : Unfortunately, it no longer retains any power...
12888 : What is your decision?
12889 : You can... Return the medal at once. Continue your efforts.
12890 : Are you certain? Yes. No.
12891 : Excellent. Speak with me again when you are ready to submit your next application. Good luck, %.
12892 : Understood. Perhaps the weight of this medal was a bit too much for you, %.
12893 : If you wish to submit another application for evaluation, please visit me again in [five days'/one hour's] time.
12894 : ...... I regret to inform you, %, that your performance this term fell a measure short of the council's expectations. Admittedly high expectations, but nevertheless...
12895 : Still, you have proven your worth to our nation on many an occasion. In light of your past services, the council has seen fit to exempt you from demotion at this time.
12896 : Incidentally, your seal will remain effective for # more day[/s] (Earth time).
12897 : Incidentally, your seal retains less than a day's power (Earth time).
12898 : Incidentally, your seal is no longer effective.
12899 : You may end your evaluation here, or press on. What say you?
12900 : Very well. We will be following your continued efforts with interest.
12901 : By ending the evaluation, you will have accepted the war council's decision to maintain your current rank, and be granted another thirty-day seal on your current medal.
12902 : However, any work you have done during the past evaluation period towards the procurement of the next medal will become null and void.
12903 : Please consider carefully your options before making this important decision.
12904 : Done. Your medal has been given a new magic seal.
12905 : Oh yes, and please note that you will not be eligible for another evaluation for [five days/one hour] (Earth time).
12906 : You are currently in possession of the most prestigious Campaign medal we have to offer. The Kingdom of San d'Oria has the utmost faith in you, and shall support you in any endeavor you choose to undertake.
12907 : You are currently in possession of the most prestigious Campaign medal we have to offer. The Republic of Bastok has the utmost faith in you, and shall support you in any endeavor you choose to undertake.
12908 : You are currently in possession of the most prestigious Campaign medal we have to offer. The Federation of Windurst has the utmost faith in you, and shall support you in any endeavor you choose to undertake.
12909 : You are a true hero to our nation. Though you may be exempt from demotion, we ask that you do not let up in the fight. Our hopes rest with you, %!

12971 : What would you like to know? About intel gathering. About the campaign region map. About reconnaissance levels. Return.
12972 : To plan successful battle strategies, current intelligence is essential. However, in this time of limited resources, it is impossible for my organization to collect all the information our nation requires.
12973 : And this is why we work closely with other sectors within the army. Reconnaissance operations performed by [men/women] such as yourself provide us with valuable data on the enemy, thus enabling our leaders to select the best courses of action.
12974 : By viewing this map, you can learn important information regarding each area within the Quon and Mindartia theaters. This includes area influence, area control, area defense, and area resources, among other things.
12975 : The Allied War Council in Jeuno has deemed this information, as well as information regarding the morale and prosperity of each nation, open to all members of the Allied Forces of Altana.
12976 : This information can be viewed at any time by opening the Allied Campaign map and moving the cursor over various locations.
12977 : However, to ensure another army does not receive an unfair advantage on the battlefield, information dealing with national funding and strategies is well protected by each respective nation, and rarely made available to even those who serve under their flag.
12978 : A nation's reconnaissance level indicates its current intel-gathering capabilities.
12979 : The higher the level, the more plentiful and detailed the information we can offer you. In extreme cases, we may even be allowed to give you insight into our nation's battle strategies.
12980 : However, without a constant flow of new intelligence, a nation's reconnaissance level will gradually fall. That is why we must rely on volunteers like you to keep us in the light!
12981 : If you seek information on your nation's campaign efforts, you're looking in the wrong place.
12982 : No new information available.

13004 : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
13005 : A B C
13024 : A B C
13025 : So you're the new scout, eh? Well, here then. Take this.
13026 : You don't get to be a scout by just walking around carrying a bunch of stuff. You gotta be nimble! Now go drop some of that garbage and come back!
13027 : Are you familiar with fiendtrappers? Fiend what now? I practically invented them.
13028 : Hmph...some scout you are. <Sigh>... The device I just issued you is called a fiendtrapper. Together with a blank fiend plate, it forms the latest in portable recording technology available to our army.
13029 : Calm down and listen, now. When you use the fiendtrapper, the data will be recorded to the blank fiend plate inside. Quite a marvelous invention, really.
13030 : Got it? Even you must have understood that explanation. Your orders are to take that device and gather enemy intel on those damnable Orcs!
13031 : A know-it-all, huh? Suit yourself. How about going and getting your hands on some enemy surveillance, then?
13032 : Off you go, now. Those Orcs aren't going to...surveil themselves. Is that even a word?
13033 : Quit wasting your time! I don't see any Orcs 'round here what needs spying on! Now get on with it!
13034 : Why do you insist on bothering me? Go and report to Rasdinice immediately!
13035 : What do you want? Some of us are busy. Do you know what busy means? Or do you require an explanation for that, too?
13036 : Well, I'll be... This is actually a nice bit of work. I can even make out the type of grass they are using to make their mount straps! Not bad, scout. Now go and get some more.
13037 : Is this some kind of joke? I can't make out a single thing on this recording. Get your act together and find something material!
13038 : Do you think I'm as blind as you are dull? The Orcs in this footage of yours are mere newborns, man! Now get back out there and find the real movers and shakers!
13039 : Who are you trying to fool wearing all those medals, huh? One would think with all that experience you'd at least have the common sense to spy on some veteran Orcs.
13040 : You've already brought in enough intel on that type of Orc. Rasdinice has instructed us to gather intel on as many different types as possible.
13041 : Not half bad, scout. Everything's in order here. See too it this information makes it's way to Rasdinice.
13042 : That's great that you're itching to get back out in the field.  But first things first. Take the intel you have and report to Rasdinice.
13043 : Oh, hello there! I've heard that there is some adventurer around here that has some ingenious ideas to help our troops in the struggle transport supplies. That wouldn't happen to be you now, would it?
13044 : Allow him to rack your brain? Rack away. No racking this day.
13045 : My mistake. I apologize for troubling you.

13054 : That is all the intel worth mentioning that we have at this time. If you have anything to contribute to our stratagems, now would be the time.
13055 : To which area do you think it wisest to dispatch a supply convoy?
13056 : Where would you send the supply convoy? Xarcabard. Beaucedine Glacier. The Eldieme Necropolis. Crawlers' Nest. Garlaige Citadel. Batallia Downs. Rolanberry Fields. Sauromugue Champaign. Jugner Forest. Pashhow Marshlands. Meriphataud Mountains. Vunkerl Inlet. Grauberg. Fort Karugo-Narugo. East Ronfaure. North Gustaberg. West Sarutabaruta.
13057 : I see. And how much cargo would you think it prudent for them to take?
13058 : It goes without saying that the more supplies there are, the happier the troops on location will be.
13059 : What amount do you recommend? A large amount. A moderate amount. A small amount.
13060 : Very well. And do you have any thoughts on which route it would be best for the convoy to take?
13061 : Which route do you endorse? The quickest, shortest route possible. The normal route used in peacetime. The safest detouring route.
13062 : Based on that route, we must consider next the convoy's escort. How large a force do you believe most appropriate?
13063 : What size escort do you suggest? A medium-sized force. A small-sized force. A minimum-sized force.
13064 : I have one last inquiry. Should the convoy encounter an enemy contingent, Goddess forbid, what course of action should they take?
13065 : Fight or flight? Engage in open battle. Avoid conflict at all cost.
13066 : Alright, I believe that covers everything. Do you have any amendments you wish to make before issuing these suggestions?
13067 : Edit your submission? No, it's solid. On second thought, yes.
13068 : Excellent. Then I shall do my utmost to see to it your tactics are implemented in tomorrow's operations.
13069 : As the mastermind behind the army's strategy for this operation, it is customary for you to travel to the stronghold in question. From there you will be able to observe the execution of your plans.
13070 : That is all. May the Goddess go with you.

13103 : Hmph. The captain feels not the necessity of informing such matters to his next in command.
13104 : We are all aware of his tendency to neglect official obligations, but duty is duty.
13105 : Intelligence confirms that the captain's father arrived back at the capital two evenings ago. The captain should therefore be available to preside over today's meeting.
13106 : Un-unless the unspeakable has befallen him during the expedition...?
13107 : S-speak not of such things, Cyranuce, not even in jest!
13108 : But, but...
13109 : Remember you not Mother's words, Cyra?
13110 : Negative thoughts breed negative outcomes.
13111 : I'm merely concerned for the welfare of our captain, nothing more! A-and how many times must I remind you to address me not by my infantile name!?
13112 : Oh, I'm sorry, Cyra...nuce.
13113 : But should Cyranuce's concern be invalidated, the captain must be subjected to disciplinary action for non-fulfillment of duty.
13114 : That Excenmille... I swear to the Goddess, the next time he marches in with that arrogant mug of his, I'll--
13115 : Ah!
13116 : You were halfway through your sentence, Rahal.
13117 : E-Excenmille!
13118 : It's been a while. How fare you all?
13119 : Captain! You've safely returned!
13120 : It would appear I've been missed.
13121 : Hurrah! The captain has returned from the expedition!
13122 : What took you so long, Excenmille? We've all been worried sick about you! Have you not respect for our feelings!?
13123 : My apologies.
13124 : I had volunteered for the rearguard, and thus arrived last of all.
13125 : Captain, you must tell us of your first battle!
13126 : Of your triumphant victories over the enemy hordes, and the honor and glory you've garnered on behalf of the Young Griffons!
13127 : There...was nothing of the sort.
13128 : Excenmille...?
13129 : The battlefield--war--is not what you think it to be...
13130 : ...
13131 : As though the fires of hell were unleashed upon Vana'diel...
13132 : Cyra...I need to change out of my breeches...
13133 : I-I shall accompany you...
13134 : So...Excenmille. What are we, the Young Griffons, to do now?
13135 : The Young Griffons...are no more.
13136 : From this day forth, the Young Griffons are disbanded.
13137 : D-d-dis...
13138 : Disbanded!?
13139 : Have you lost your mind!?
13140 : I am dead serious.
13141 : Wait.
13142 : None of us here discounts the graveness of your experience, the terrible things to which you bore witness.
13143 : But surely, you've not forgotten the reason for our establishment?
13144 : It was folly... All of it.
13145 : What are you saying!?
13146 : There is no place for children on the battlefield.
13147 : B-but Captain, you too, are--
13148 : I made a promise to Father.
13149 : A promise...?
13150 : I will be joining the expeditionary force.
13151 : ...!?
13152 : The knights will strike west--far, far west. Even Father knows not when we will return.
13153 : I had best prepare for departure.
13154 : Farewell, all.
13155 : Don't you dare walk away!
13156 : I won't forgive you if you do!
13157 : Who was it that established the Young Griffons--started it all? You, Excenmille! You!
13158 : Our fair nation would crumble if the elders were left to their own devices--that's what you made us believe in, the vision we all shared.
13159 : But now, you're just going to disappear and leave us here...
13160 : Don't you dare walk away!
13161 : No, wait... I see what has happened.
13162 : You've grown up and become like one of the elders, haven't you?
13163 : A self-serving, self-centered elder who opens his mouth only to vomit up pathetic excuses...and turns tail at the mere sight of adversity!
13164 : ...!?
13165 : Rahal...
13166 : Don't you presume to understand my feelings!
13167 : ...!
13168 : Are you satisfied now? This is the final order from your commanding officer: the Young Griffons are disbanded!
13169 : Playtime is over!
13170 : C-Captain!
13171 : Damn him!
13172 : L-Lieutenant!
13173 : I say, I doubt any of us saw that coming...
13174 : This is the lowest point in the proud history of the Young Griffons.
13175 : There is naught that can be done but wait for tempers to cool...
13176 : Ah, Squire Altennia! % approaches!
13177 : %, I have been searching high and low for you.
13178 : I trust you've been informed of Excenmille's partaking in the upcoming expedition.
13179 : The knights in the expeditionary force will be receiving an official send-off before the Victory Gate presently.
13180 : I was hoping you could join us in saying farewell to our fearless young hero.
13181 : Squire Altennia, to where are Excenmille and the Knights of the Cardinal Stag headed?
13182 : Will you promise that this knowledge goes not beyond these walls? Their destination is the Marquisate of Tavnazia.
13183 : Tavnazia?
13184 : Ooh, ooh, I know that place! I overheard Father telling Mother that it's currently being targeted by Orcish forces!
13185 : I see Griffons' intelligence is as reliable as ever. Excenmille's father, Count Aurchiat, has mobilized the knights to reinforce the Tavnazian defensive effort.
13186 : Tavnazia is reputed to be an impregnable natural stronghold that can hold enemy forces that would elsewhere be overwhelming at bay. Even the count himself vouches for its superior defensive capacity. But, still...
13187 : Oh, how could I have been so forgetful? I was tasked with preparing wine for this very occasion! Let's rendezvous before the Victory Gate in a short while.
13188 : We'll be right there!
13189 : I am not going.
13190 : Huh?
13191 : Excenmille has chosen to forsake the Young Griffons, and is no longer one of us. We have no obligation whatsoever to see him off.
13192 : Oh? Then, I shan't go...I guess.
13193 : Rahal speaks the truth. I won't go either.
13194 : If Cyra isn't going, then I won't either!
13195 : <Sigh>... This, I saw coming malms away...
13196 : I assume you've reached the same conclusion as the rest of us, %?
13197 : The motion has been approved via a majority vote!
13198 : We unanimously decided upon not seeing off the cap--er, former captain...but was it the right decision?
13199 : I wonder if the procession hasn't yet passed through the Victory Gate?
13200 : Here to see off the Knights of the Cardinal Stag, are you? The procession should be passing through any moment now.
13201 : Ah, there [he/she] is.
13202 : Look, Excenmille.
13203 : % has been kind enough to come and see you off on your journey.
13204 : Well, if it isn't our fine Young Griffon! Still always first off the mark, I see.
13205 : But, the Young Griffons are no more...
13206 : %...
13207 : Was it a mistake?
13208 : N...never mind. It's nothing.
13209 : Excenmille!
13210 : Wh-what in the world do you think you're doing, Altennia!?
13211 : Must you always be so stubborn and unyielding?
13212 : Y-you misunderstand me! I simply could bear not the thought of them...my friends...suffering.
13213 : Altennia?
13214 : I want you to promise me...
13215 : Promise me that you'll come back safe and sound.
13216 : I...promise.
13217 : Excenmille!
13218 : We've barely departed, yet you're already straggling? Get your act together, soldier! We've a long ride ahead!
13219 : He's really gone...
13220 : We will be able to see that mischievous smile again, won't we?
13221 : But, I just can't help but feel as though...
13222 : <Sob, sniffle> Wh-what am I doing, breaking down like this on such a momentous day for Excenmille? I...I'm so sorry!
13223 : In the end I refrained from going to see off Excenmille, as was decided by the majority.
13224 : But, this feeling of guilt gnawing away at my conscience... Perhaps I should have done otherwise?
13225 : Hmm? Those footsteps...
13226 : G-Goddess have mercy!
13227 : All Griffons to stations! Enemies approach!
13228 : H-hold where you are, intruder! This is the t-territory of the Young G-G-Griffons! State your business, or b-begone!
13229 : Eep!
13230 : S-Sir Rongelouts. To what do we owe the honor of your presence?
13231 : Who claims to be the leader of this maggoty rabble?
13232 : What's the matter? Lost the taste for playing soldiers all of a sudden?
13233 : Bah. A hiding place behind your mothers' skirts is more appropriate for your like.
13234 : Wh-what!?
13235 : Eyes front!
13236 : This here is Vailanice of the Knights of the Iron Ram. He has orders to confiscate that decrepit Orcish warmachine there, and will hence return here for that purpose shortly.
13237 : Wh-what did you say!?
13238 : <Sniff, sniff>... And I expect you to at least do something about the offensive odor before then.
13239 : I think not! The base--warmachine--is the property of the Young Griffons!
13240 : Please understand, children. Your warmachine is necessary to ensure the success of our next mission.
13241 : Save your breath, Vailanice. These maggots need not be privileged with an explanation.
13242 : But, sir, considering what will become of the warmachine, an explanation would not be entirely undue...
13243 : !?
13244 : Sir Rongelouts. If I may be so bold, would your interest in our base be for the purpose of deployment in simulated battle?
13245 : Hah, an educated if uninformed guess.
13246 : A whole month of my time has been invested to painstakingly convert the machine for Elvaan use.
13247 : I would therefore be most obliged if it was not subjected to rough treatment of any degree.
13248 : That thing is still operational, you say? Most curious indeed...
13249 : ...!
13250 : It seems I was mistaken--not all maggots are useless.
13251 : You in there. I hereby appoint you to the exalted post of Maggot Engineer.
13252 : Hahahahaha! For your inaugural assignment, you are to restore the machine to perfect working condition by the time of pickup. My expectations of you are high, so don't disappoint me now.
13253 : Damn that moustached megalomaniac!
13254 : Cyra, what will become of our base?
13255 : I know not...
13256 : Our course of action is obvious. If we are to retain our base and dignity, we must engage with the Iron Rams.
13257 : Take on the Knights of the Iron Ram? Have you lost your marbles? Excenmille isn't even with us anymore...
13258 : ...
13259 : I have a plan.
13260 : We simply build a new warmachine.
13261 : A replica of the original.
13262 : Are you certain this is possible? I thought repairing the original machine alone required one whole month on your part.
13263 : Who mentioned anything about quality? As long as the appearance is identical, our purpose shall be served.
13264 : Even so, judging from Rongelouts's tone of voice, we'd be fortunate to have even a day.
13265 : I believe that the young knight charged with confiscation duty--Vailanice--has at best only limited mechanical knowledge.
13266 : Should he show up inconveniently early, a white lie pertaining to the machine's unready state should suffice in buying us more time.
13267 : Hmm, this plan might actually be feasible...
13268 : Bistillot, I want you to commence on-location preparations at once.
13269 : Rholont, Cyranuce, and Machegue--you three come with me. Our mission is to infiltrate into Laborman's Way and procure wood scraps from the Carpenters' Guild.
13270 : Understood!
13271 : And lastly, %.
13272 : You are the strongest and most experienced of us all.
13273 : For this reason, we need you to head out to Jugner Forest and scavenge for %.
13274 : Um...Lieutenant Rahal?
13275 : What is it, Rholont?
13276 : I seem to have...misplaced my nerves somewhere.
13277 : Ahaha...ha.
13278 : In that case, you may remain here and resume sentinel duty.
13279 : Alert Engineer Bistillot to any encroaching danger, like you always do.
13280 : <Sigh> Tainted is mine honor...
13281 : Teehee!
13282 : Now listen to me, all of you! Consider this a chance to demonstrate to that traitor, Excenmille, that the Young Griffons need him not!
13283 : Hear! Hear!
13284 : ...
13285 : %, your mission requires you to travel to Jugner Forest and procure %!
13286 : Why, th-this is %!
13287 : I shall inform Engineer Bistillot immediately!
13288 : A push here...and a twist there... And that's that. The wheels are now attached.
13289 : Uwaaah! M-maintain horizontal balance or else the wheels will come off!
13290 : Faster, Cyra! Faster!
13291 : I'm...<puff>...not...<wheeze>...an Orc...
13292 : Now we can surely exact revenge on that bewhiskered brute...and without any help from Excenmille!
13293 : This shall be our sweetest moment yet!
13294 : Oh, and before I forget, this is a little something for you, %.
13295 : Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Iron Rams in the vicinity!
13296 : Hmm? Eek! S-Sir Rongelouts is among them!
13297 : N-no time to proceed calmly! All officers, evacuate with extreme haste!
13298 : Wh-what? Is anyone still here? Anyone!?
13299 : So at long last we've successfully seized one of their siege engines...
13300 : Yes, sir. The machine in question has been transported to the provision storehouse for the time being.
13301 : I would see with my own eyes this device of destruction that threatens to lay waste to our nation. What is its operational status?
13302 : Reports indicate that the machine was discovered abandoned, and procured in near-pristine condition, sir.
13303 : Pristine...yet abandoned?
13304 : Hm? What is this Orcish warmachine doing here?
13305 : Vailanice, add this to your list of items to confiscate.
13306 : The maggots' warmachine alone would not make for a sufficiently realistic battle simulation. This will make a welcome addition.
13307 : Huh!?
13308 : Hm?
13309 : Vailanice, is that the kind of response you were trained to use towards superiors?
13310 : Uh, no sir... I mean, I hadn't actually said anything...sir.
13311 : Heh. My ears must still be ringing from the cannon blasts of the accursed pigmen...
13312 : Captain, if I may...
13313 : What is it?
13314 : It's about the children, sir. Might there not be a way we can perhaps--
13315 : No, no, allow me to finish that sentence: The kind and benevolent Iron Ram Knight, Vailanice, wishes to allow the pitiful children to keep their plaything?
13316 : Fool!!!
13317 : Your glut of sympathy will jeopardize the very lives of those you are charged to protect!
13318 : Including those of the same little maggots you're hell-bent to appease!
13319 : F-forgive me, sir.
13320 : I shall go and confiscate their warmachine this instant.
13321 : Hold it, soldier. The battle simulation is canceled.
13322 : Sir!?
13323 : The close examination of the newly acquired siege engine takes precedence. We leave for the Garlaige Citadel, posthaste.
13324 : Sir, yes sir! I shall have the regiment prepare for departure immediately!
13325 : ...
13326 : Oh?
13327 : What is it, Rholont?
13328 : Was Bistillot not present during the evacuation...?
13329 : Oops...
13330 : Finally remembered poor Bistillot, left at the mercy of the bearded barbarian, did we?
13331 : W-we're sorry...
13332 : Apologies are quite unnecessary, as through pure genius I was able to turn the inauspicious situation to my advantage. Anyone care for some classified information, fresh off the lips of our not-so-favorite captain of the Iron Rams?
13333 : Classified information, you say!?
13334 : The Iron Rams will shortly depart for the Garlaige Citadel.
13335 : Gar...laige? I cannot say that name is familiar to me.
13336 : I suspect it to be a secret base of operation for the Allied Forces.
13337 : A secret base? With spies and saboteurs!?
13338 : Then what of the operation to retain our base?
13339 : As far as I was able to observe, Sir Rongelouts was very much taken in by the decoy. However...
13340 : However?
13341 : A new discovery of critical import has diverted his attention from our base, and battle simulations have been postponed until further notice.
13342 : So all our effort dispensed to build the replica was for naught?
13343 : But, Cyra, this means...
13344 : ...The strategy was a success! Against staggering odds, we have successfully defended our base against the ruthless onslaught of the elders!
13345 : Hurrah! Long live the Young Griffons!
13346 : ...
13347 : Lend me your ears, all of you.
13348 : I have been contemplating this for some time now. The Young Griffons will be disbanded, as was Excenmille's parting wish.
13349 : Wh-what!?
13350 : But from its ashes...
13351 : The Knights of the Swiftwing Griffin shall arise!
13352 : Griffin? You would adopt the creature gracing San d'Oria's coat of arms as our own?
13353 : No other would be more fitting to our cause.
13354 : Call it a hunch, but I sense something afoot at the citadel--something upon which the very survival of our nation is dependent.
13355 : An event of this magnitude cannot be left in the charge of a poor excuse for a knight like Rongelouts!
13356 : Right!
13357 : That is why the Young Griffons must evolve and mature into a greater existence, one that is on equal terms with the elders.
13358 : Your logic is crystal clear to me, sir!
13359 : But...who will lead us?
13360 : Of that, you needn't worry.
13361 : I shall personally take responsibility as the new captain!
13362 : But, only if you'll all have me, naturally.
13363 : Captain...Rahal!
13364 : Long have we waited to hear those words from you.
13365 : Long live Captain Rahal! Long live the Knights of the Swiftwing Griffin!
13366 : Thank you, everyone...
13367 : My first command as Captain is as follows: The Swiftwing Griffins are to head to the Garlaige Citadel and uncover Rongelouts's objective!
13368 : Yes, sir!
13369 : Er...Captain, sir. What of our base during the mission?
13370 : Rholont, Bistillot, will you see to its defense?
13371 : <Sigh> Just as I thought...
13372 : The care of the base is a heavy burden that can only be entrusted to our most dependable. For this reason, Sentinel Rholont, I appoint you Castellan of Swiftwing Fortress.
13373 : C-Castellan!
13374 : Yes sir, Captain Rahal, sir! I shall defend Swiftwing Fortress with my life!
13375 : We're counting on you, Castellan Rholont.
13376 : Gather around, my brave knights!
13377 : We, the Knights of the Swiftwing Griffin!
13378 : We, the Knights of the Swiftwing Griffin!
13379 : Hereby solemnly swear upon our pride and honor...
13380 : To protect our homeland, San d'Oria, unto our dying breath!
13381 : Hurrah!!!
13382 : How may I assist you, %?
13383 : Captain Rahal and the Swiftwing Griffins have departed for Sauromugue Champaign.
13384 : If you already are aware of the whereabouts of the Garlaige Citadel, you may be able to catch up to them.
13385 : Disbanded.
13386 : Headstrong.
13387 : Send-off.
13388 : Danger.
13389 : Reborn.
13390 : Follow A1.
13391 : Follow B1.
13392 : Follow C1.
13393 : Follow D1.

13395 : Well, you're certainly looking quite hapless, adventurer. Have you not your wits about you?
13396 : What's all the commotion, you ask? Well, everyone is on their way to see Troupe Mayakov's performance, of course. My comrades have been scrambling about relentlessly for some time now trying to procure tickets.
13397 : Surely you are familiar with Troupe Mayakov, yes?
13398 : Are you familiar with Troupe Mayakov? No, not at all familiar. Yes, exceedingly familiar.
13399 : What!? I cannot even begin to imagine the enormity of the rock under which you must have been hiding. Why, they are one of the most popular dancing troupes in Vana'diel right now, rivaled perhaps only by Troupe Brilioth.
13400 : Though from a stylistic and technical point of view, I am of the personal opinion that Troupe Mayakov is considerably more advanced.
13401 : Of course, it certainly doesn't hurt that they have amassed some of the most adorable dancers I've ever seen!
13402 : As well you should! They've come to gain quite the reputation amongst the people recently for their lineup of beauties. Only the finest are selected, they say.
13403 : In fact, a show is about to start over at the old tavern in Lion Square. The troupe leader has decided to grace San d'Oria with a performance by popular demand.
13404 : Such a chance to see performers of that caliber up close doesn't present itself very often. Everyone sure is up in a frenzy over it, all right.
13405 : Well, if you have time yourself, I would highly recommend you pay a visit. Although I offer no guarantee that you'll be able to get your hands on a ticket.
13406 : What I wouldn't give to not be on guard duty... <Sigh>...
13407 : Mr. Mayakov, let me first of all thank you for taking the time to speak with us here today. We know that you are a busy man.
13408 : Now please, sir, if you would, share with us what you consider to be the highlight of this, your latest show.
13409 : It would be my pleathure. Ath I'm thure you all know by now, my Troupe Mayakov only incorporateth the motht beautiful and dathling of elementth into ith danth.
13410 : However, it hath come to my attention ath of late, that we have reached the abtholute pinnacle of vithible aeththetic beauty.
13411 : Well, errr... That's...
13412 : And tho one reathon I have come here today ith to make it known that thome time ago I made it our troupe philothophy to theek out new horithonth and new challengeth. To be true vanguardth of our art.
13413 : And guided by that philothophy, I have dithcovered a new theme for our danthe. A new realm to throw ourthelveth into. A new moduth operandi by which to move and bring delight to our audienth. "Dreamth"!
13414 : Through our danthe and our art, we hope to bring dreamth to everyone in their troubled timeth.
13415 : That is a most intriguing concept, Mr. Mayakov. And, may I say, a theme most befitting a dance troupe as beautiful and as glamorous as Troupe Mayakov.
13416 : The majethtic drawing of the curtain! The dathling thine of the thpotlight! And then! The unparalleled beauty and grathe of my danthing angelth!
13417 : The flying of thweat off of pathion-driven browth! The hypnotic clicking of heelth on the hard, polithed, wooden thtage! I promithe to thend our audienthe home with an evening of rapture they will not thoon forget!
13418 : Bravo! Bravo!
13419 : But, Mr. Mayakov, what is your response, then, to pundits who claim that the current state of affairs is not particularly conducive to the continuation of extravagant arts such as dance?
13420 : Utter nonthenth!
13421 : I don't care if it'th coming from the Thadow Lord himthelf, or any other perthon for that matter!
13422 : I don't care if it'th in front of the royal throne, or before the very gateth of hell!
13423 : Troupe Mayakov will continue to danthe no matter what the thircumthantheth!
13424 : Spoken like a true artist!
13425 : Hm...?
13426 : What ith thith perthon doing here? Gindaff, come!
13427 : How do you exthplain thith thpecator getting patht thecurity? The thow hath yet to begin.
13428 : My apologies, Mr. Mayakov, sir.
13429 : I apprethiate your enthuthiathm, but I'm afraid we are thtill undergoing pre-thow preparathionth. I'll have to athk you to leave for the time being, but be thure to come back later with your ticket.
13430 : Wait a moment, there...
13431 : Do you even have a ticket?
13432 : Do you have a ticket? Got it right here! N-no, I don't.
13433 : Well then, thertainly you wouldn't mind thowing it to me. Humor me, if you would, pleathe.
13434 : Heeheehee, thurely you're joking. What kind of thidethow attracthion do you take Troupe Mayakov for? Ticketh to our performanthe have been thold out for weekth!
13435 : Even the platinum ticketh going for hundredth of thouthandth of gil thold out in the blink of an eye.
13436 : Unfortunately, without a ticket, you thimply cannot get into the thow. I'm thorry, but you'll jutht have to chalk it up to a lack of luck thith time.
13437 : Thee to it our guetht findth [hith/her] way out, Gindaff!
13438 : Come ooon, when is the show going to start? I can't wait...
13439 : I've been looking forward to this for weeks. And now that it's so close, I can barely contain myself! How much longer will it be?
13440 : Unfortunately our rehearsals have run a bit longer than initially expected. The troupe asks that you remain patient for just a bit longer, and offers its sincerest apologies for any inconvenience.
13441 : Well, this doesn't look promising. I have to get going soon...
13442 : You scoundrel!
13443 : Ah! Wh-what are you doing here!?
13444 : So this is what was so important you had to leave the shop? What is this? What's going on here?
13445 : N-nothing. It's just some... Well, there's this...
13446 : What's that you have there? A ticket? Troupe...Mayakov...?
13447 : No, no! I have no idea what that is! I didn't do anything! I admit nothing!
13448 : I knew you were up to something, acting all shady like you were! And look at you now! Skipping work and leaving the shop unattended to come to a place like this!
13449 : Well, if you don't get back to work, there'll be no dinner tonight! Or any other night for that matter!
13450 : But I...like...dinner...
13451 : You do not have %!
13452 : You, again? Quite the perthithtent one, aren't you? Thome people never learn, I thuppothe.
13453 : Hm? You brought a ticket with you thith time? Let'th have a look at it, then.
13454 : What the...
13455 : Ewww... It looks as though it's been through hell and back! Do I even want to know what happened to that ticket?
13456 : It'th filthy! Ith thith thing even real?
13457 : To be sure, it bears the seal of the Melusine, our official logo. Everything seems to be in order...
13458 : Hmmm...
13459 : I'm thorry, I can't allow it. That you could have come upon a ticket tho quickly, and in thuch condition, ith motht...thuth-thuthpithiouth.
13460 : We've had enough trouble with people trying to get in with fake ticketh already.
13461 : Excuse me, please pardon my interruption.
13462 : Oooh! Thir Ragelithe of the Knighth of the Ironcretht Hawk. It ith a motht profound honor for Troupe Mayakov to be blethed by your cuthtom!
13463 : We have been eagerly awaiting your arrival, thir! The finetht theat in the houthe hath been prepared for your viewing pleathure and comfort!
13464 : I am most pleased to hear that. What's this? Is there some trouble?
13465 : No, thir, not at all. Thimply another fan trying to gain entry with a fake ticket. You needn't worry yourthelf. We have matterth well under control.
13466 : I even have half a mind to order them all rounded up and thrown into Ronfaure for their detheit!
13467 : I'm afraid I can't stand idly by and let you treat my friend in such a manner.
13468 : Thir!? Your...friend, thir!?
13469 : That's correct. Isn't that right? So please, some leniency, I beg of you.
13470 : My profuthe apologieth, Thir Ragelithe! I intended no dithrethpect.
13471 : Indeed, a friend of our great and noble guetht, Thir Ragelithe, thall be more than welcome by Troupe Mayakov.
13472 : Forgive my impertinenthe. Troupe Mayakov ith honored by your patronage.
13473 : The performanthe will begin momentarily. Pleathe hurry to your theatth!
13474 : Well, that was a close call, wouldn't you say? Artists! Haha, the troupe leader is by no means a bad fellow. But he certainly can be a stubborn and selfish one.
13475 : You caught my eye by the door, there, adventurer. You have an air of regality about you. You are a knight of the Kingdom, yes?
13476 : Ahhh, serving under Grand Knight Rongelouts in the Knights of the Iron Ram, are you?
13477 : I had heard that a recent addition to his ranks was turning out to be an exemplary recruit. No doubt it was you this rumor was in reference to.
13478 : Of the Republic, you say? A Bastoker, are you? In the Seventh Legionnaires? That sounds vaguely familiar...
13479 : Ah, yes, of course! Led by Praefectus Zazarg, if I recall correctly. A position to be proud of.
13480 : Windurst!? You don't say! And one of the Cobra Mercenaries, no less? That explains the hardened look in your eyes. No doubt you have plenty a story to tell.
13481 : Nearly everyone by now knows of the capable command of your Romaa Mihgo. The tales of her deeds reach us even here in San d'Oria.
13482 : I needn't tell you, then, of the horrors of this great war. The ranks of the Beastman Confederate stretch in all directions with no end in sight. We in the service of the Allied Forces rarely have a free moment to enjoy the very freedoms we fight for.
13483 : Which is why it is so essential that we make the most of our time away from duty. To forget the troubles and worries that this war has thrust upon us, and to enjoy what little time we have with our friends and loved ones.
13484 : That is why I spoke up on your behalf at the door.
13485 : Hm? Who am I? Oh, well, that's neither here nor there. Consider me no more than a fellow soldier.
13486 : But let us speak now of what brings us here. The critics are touting Troupe Mayakov's performance as the show to see! And I can attest firsthand to the quality of the dancers. Come, come. Let us enjoy the evening.
13487 : I love the anticipation of a good show!
13488 : It begins!
13489 : Greetings to all, and a heartfelt thank you on behalf of the troupe for gracing us with your presence tonight. And without further delay, on to the evening's presentation!
13490 : Come now, and behold a fair dance, Be moved to dream, in deep waking trance!
13491 : Pauper, sage, even the nobleman knows, All are welcomed, with warmth, by Troupe Mayakov! Old hag, young beauty, even the sweet child knows,  All are embraced, with love, by Troupe Mayakov!
13492 : Sever ties, fettered fool, and make merry this night! Come now, honored guests, and forget all this night!
13493 : For the dark, still young, swallowed the sun what once shone, And the time to revel is this night, and now alone!
13494 : Let the show begin!
13495 : See? Didn't I tell you? A group of lookers all!
13496 : You better not even think about making a move on the one all the way on the right, though. I've got my sights set on her! Don't make me pull rank on you!
13497 : So what do you think of Troupe Mayakov? Simply amazing, aren't they?
13498 : It's easy to see how they have come to be known as the pixies of the battlefield. I've never seen such grace and beauty of movement. And so seemingly effortless...
13499 : Which dancer are you finding to be the most entertaining?
13500 : Which dancer is your favorite? The one on the right. The one in the middle. The one on the left.
13501 : And now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, the moment you have all been waiting for. A solo performance by the star of Troupe Mayakov, the Moonshade Butterfly, Lilisette!
13502 : Hm? Caught your attention, has she?
13503 : That's Lilisette. They say she's a real mystery, that one. Not too much is known about her.
13504 : She only just recently joined the troupe. But apparently she was able to pass their stringent screening on the first go. No easy feat, that. Troupe Mayakov is notoriously strict in their recruiting practices.
13505 : An absolute natural. See how she captivates the audience the instant she sets foot on the stage? Such a gifted child...
13506 : And nobody knows how or why. She doesn't speak about her age, where she's been, where she's from. All anyone knows is that her father is an Elvaan and her mother a Hume. Other than that, she's a complete mystery.
13507 : No doubt that aura of mystery has helped to propel her to such stardom so quickly. If there's one thing people love, it's the effect of the exotic. We love the unknown.
13508 : And so the fluttering of the butterfly's flight draws to a close. Did you find yourself traipsing the night winds with her, guided by the light of the moon?
13509 : And how will your experience this evening change you, ladies and gentlemen? Was the seed of a dream planted tonight that will bloom? Or simply fade away...?
13510 : Sir Ragelise! There you are, sir!  We have been searching all over for you.
13511 : The order is most distressed, sir! For the commanding officer of the Knights of the Ironcrest Hawk to be wandering about in the open is most uncouth.
13512 : Hahaha, you would rather I remain in my quarters, the overprotected maiden in her tower, yes?
13513 : But it is regulation, sir! Surely this is no laughing matter.
13514 : Yes, yes, very well. I only jest. I gave our hawks quite the scare, did I?
13515 : Yes, sir. All of our knights have assembled on the Parade Ground awaiting some news.
13516 : Then I shall go and set their minds at ease, at once. By your leave, Mr. Mayakov.
13517 : On behalf of my entire troupe, thir, good night to you.
13518 : Hm? What is it?
13519 : If you'll excuse me, I have some minor business I must see to.
13520 : I'm sure that our paths will cross again. We are on the same side, after all. Farewell for now.
13521 : How fare things in La Vaule?
13522 : Sir, according to intelligence reports from the latest courier, ranks are currently regrouping at that location.
13523 : The Knights of the Madder Falcon report to be rebuilding the defenses and barricading strategic points. The resistance, however, continues in waves...
13524 : A considerable portion of the local populace has already been abducted by the beastmen, sir. We haven't a moment to lose. The time to act is at hand!
13525 : Agreed. The position cannot be lost! Deploy immediately!
13526 : Sir, there is another...problem to consider.
13527 : What is it?
13528 : Sir, we too are preoccupied here at the capital with the rebuilding of fortifications and rallying of the troops. In anticipation of your orders we attempted to garner what forces we could to send into the field, but... I'm afraid such a force would be significantly lacking in its capabilities to reinforce the location, sir.
13529 : You needn't worry yourself about that. I had considered our lack of manpower and took the liberty of scouting a formidable ally to our cause.
13530 : A formidable ally, sir?
13531 : I had heard the Kingdom wath low on infantry, but I hadn't imagined the thituathion wath thith dire.
13532 : Ah, there you are, Mr. Mayakov. Your assistance is most welcome!
13533 : What you see is quite remarkable in its own right, considering the blow which we suffered at the Battle of La Theine.
13534 : Sir Ragelise, if I may inquire as to who our guest is?
13535 : Of course. This is the leader of the prestigious Troupe Mayakov. He has agreed to lend us the strength of his dancers in our desperate hour.
13536 : Troupe Mayakov? The d-dancers, sir?
13537 : Don't be mistaken, knight. The dancers may hide themselves away in obscurity in these traveling troupes...
13538 : But they shall play a key role on the battlefields in our opposition to this damnable Beastman Confederate!
13539 : But surely...
13540 : The majority of Troupe Mayakov'th memberth are orphanth who were brought up at the convent in La Vaule.
13541 : Believe me when I tell you that none are more dithheartened than we by the current thtate of affairth there.
13542 : We may not be the impothing fighting forthe that you were hoping for, but we will do everything in our power to protect our homeland.
13543 : Portia!
13544 : The lovely lady you thee before you ith not only one of our more talented performerth, but altho our motht accomplithed battle danther. No doubt Portia here will prove an invaluable addition to your cauthe.
13545 : Are you sure you are up to the task, my lady?
13546 : By your will, milord. Should it please you, Sir Ragelise, I would willingly follow you to the very ends of Vana'diel.
13547 : What about the other one? The cute one... Lilisette, I think her name was. Can she come along as well?
13548 : Bah! Lilithette ith thtill but a mere child. Only rethently hath the joined our troupe and I have no intenthionth of endangering her life.
13549 : <Sigh>... All right...
13550 : It is settled, then. We depart at once! Knights, bid farewell to your ladies.
13551 : <Gulp>... F-farewell, sir?
13552 : Do not be so easily shaken, boys! It is only a figure of speech! Tell them naught but you love them, and shall hold them in your arms again before many nights pass!
13553 : Dismissed!
13554 : The door is firmly locked...
13555 : I wonder if perhaps... No, it couldn't be...
13556 : Wh--!? My apologies, [sir/ma'am]. You gave me a bit of a start, is all.
13557 : I beg your indulgence. My mind wanders and is ill at ease. If you would please be so kind as to excuse me.
13558 : Unless... If I may be so bold as to impose upon you, [sir/ma'am]. A certain dilemma of sorts has been plaguing me for quite some time now. It has me up at nights, truth be told.
13559 : Does this talk interest you? Immensely, yes. Not in the least, no.
13560 : Very well. I would humbly ask that you leave me to my own devices, then. I bid you good day, [sir/ma'am].
13561 : That could only mean...
13562 : No, no. By Altana, that simply cannot be...
13563 : Ah, but first, do allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Nichais, the humble and most junior of sons born to a countryside lord of no notable circumstance.
13564 : I made the journey to the capital here with hopes of studying under the most prestigious historians in the Kingdom. I have been fortunate enough to secure such a post, interning at the private residence of a very well-known scholar.
13565 : And may I ask your name, kind adventurer?
13566 : It is both an honor and a privilege to make your acquaintance, %.
13567 : Well, I shall not presume to waste any more of your time than I absolutely must. Tell me, does the topic of the great wyrms interest you? For it is they I wish to speak to you about this day!
13568 : Pray tell, have you heard the legends of the so-called Eastdrake? It is believed the beast resides somewhere in the craggy, cavernous expanses of Grauberg, though any such accounts are of course no more than hearsay.
13569 : The legend itself has been passed down for hundreds of years now. The oldest existing literature on the subject claims that the wyrm's ancestral home lies somewhere in the Far East.
13570 : Many finer details of the stories differ from one another, but one astonishing fact seems to be agreed upon by all the sources I have had the chance to study. They say that the wyrm relished in taking on the form of an elegant young Elvaan maiden, under the guise of which she would call upon villages and hamlets.
13571 : Until one day she capriciously took wing and bore the high winds to our continent of Quon, settling in the harsh environs of Grauberg. There she met a great and mighty warrior, and they bound themselves to their words and to each other, entering into a noble and timeless oath.
13572 : A pact born of honor, and swearing protection. The Eastdrake thus became the Mountain's Eye, vowing to give her life in defense of the peak, the warrior, and his line, for all of time.
13573 : I have since been to Grauberg to bear witness for myself. The only vestiges now left of this ancient tradition are the scattered Elvaan settlements which still hold true to the cult of the great wyrm.
13574 : Even so, the mere thought of a wyrm what takes on the shape of an Elvaan maiden... Surely the stuff of fairy tales. Until now, most all of the pundits here in the capital who occupy themselves with the study of such topics, myself included, had simply written the entire account off as a mummer's farce. Or at the very best, an anachronistic myth.
13575 : But something has happened recently which has given me cause to reconsider my views.
13576 : Soldiers of our own Allied Forces returning from campaigns in Grauberg bring back most intriguing tales! Eyewitness accounts of an enormous dragon in the region!
13577 : Upon hearing this, my thoughts went immediately to the legend of the Mountain's Eye, and my hope of proving the myth was rekindled.
13578 : And so we come to my present dilemma. Please forgive the brevity of my synopsis, but you must admit it is a rather intriguing story, yes?
13579 : I cannot help but wonder whether or not there is some way of confirming if this wyrm actually exists. And if so, could it truly be the Mountain's Eye of which the legends speak? The wyrm who walks as an Elvaan, as the books say?
13580 : I implore you, if your travels ever happen to take you within the vicinity of Grauberg, would you mind investigating the premises for me?
13581 : I would forever be in your debt, %.
13582 : %! How very good to see you again!
13583 : I truly hope you can forgive my abrupt parting back in Grauberg. But it was not without good reason that I felt the need to return to the city's walls at once, I promise you.
13584 : It concerns the wyrm we saw taking flight, and the young girl those hooded callers were referring to as Areuhat.
13585 : I gather that your powers of reason are sound enough to reach the obvious conclusion.
13586 : Yes, I can now state without the slightest doubt that the creature we saw was indeed the Mountain's Eye of Grauberg! And the young Elvaan maiden named Areuhat, none other than the same wyrm in its mortal guise!
13587 : According to the recorded legends which I have been poring over...
13588 : Her supplicants had dubbed her Odzmanouk, which for whatever reason she found to be too harsh for her liking. Instead, she insisted that her followers refer to her as Areuhat, and Areuhat alone, and so it was.
13589 : All of the signs I took note of back in Grauberg I have confirmed here in the annals. The angel-like hair with its platinum brilliance, the ornate eastern fineries and garments, the manner of speech. And that unmistakable Elvaan maiden...
13590 : I concede it is a bit much to absorb all at once, and perhaps difficult to believe. But as you well saw for yourself, the splendor that being possessed was nothing short of a bona fide deity. Never before have I witnessed such radiance, nor felt such presence.
13591 : The grace with which her wings embraced the sky, and the solemn, divine aura about her. The books had not prepared me, they made no mention of this...this sublime majesty.
13592 : Still, even if that young Elvaan should prove to be the Eastdrake, it is no cause to rejoice.
13593 : The men accompanying her appeared to me to be emissaries dispatched from the east, seeking her audience. I cannot be sure of their motives, but no doubt they are seizing upon this opportunity while Grauberg is racked by the maelstrom of war.
13594 : It sounded as though they were attempting to persuade the Mountain's Eye to relinquish her post and return to the East. And from the looks of it, she was not entirely opposed to the idea. I fear we haven't much time!
13595 : To think I have come this far, only to lose sight of my goal now! But no, I must not give myself to despair just yet.
13596 : There may still be a chance to remedy the situation.
13597 : Countless hours spent in the cathedral's libraries laboring over the archives have not gone unrewarded. I uncovered a mere whisper of a clue, lost to the ages beneath stacks of papyrus and parchment.
13598 : It would seem that keeping the peace around Grauberg was not the only charge put to the Elvaan warrior by the Mountain's Eye in their pact with one another.
13599 : There is mention of a certain fancy of Areuhat's, which was agreed to be given to her as an offering on a daily basis.
13600 : The text I discovered, however, was extremely cryptic. A riddle, one might say... Do listen.
13601 : It read, An ageless armor, impenetrable, and yet of no metal wrought. To lay at rest only the comfort of anvil-hard beds are sought. Protected from without, protecting from within, yielding naught.
13602 : Unfortunately, it does not go on to specify exactly what the offering is. No doubt it was intended to be a closely-guarded secret known only to a select few. I'm afraid these were the only details I was able to uncover.
13603 : But if we were somehow able to ascertain the true identity of this item, perhaps we could make an offering of it in the manner that the text describes. And if that young Elvaan maid is truly the great wyrm of the East...
13604 : I am the first to admit, that is a great many if's. But should they all prove true, by the grace of the Goddess... Well, then perhaps ingratiating ourselves with the great Eastdrake of legend is not as unrealistic as I thought!
13605 : %, you must forgive my persistent impositions. It was truly never my intention to come to rely so heavily upon you. But I fear I have another task to ask of you.
13606 : I plan to remain here and throw myself wholeheartedly into the deciphering of this riddle. If you happen across anything in your travels that you feel may fit this description, would you be so good as to bring it to me?
13607 : I promise that your efforts will not go unrewarded!
13608 : %, you've returned! So good of you to come again. Pray tell, were you able to gain any insight into our little puzzle?
13609 : Hmmm... I certainly had not thought of this. Though, to be honest, I'm not sure I see the relevance. Perhaps we are veering farther from the truth.
13610 : %, what's this? Hmmm... Most intriguing. I dare say, I think you may be on to something with this.
13611 : Yes, it just may be... But...
13612 : Alas, %, I fear this may be a bit too large.
13613 : By the Goddess! An authentic %! How did you happen across a copy of this!? Are you aware of the value and rarity of this text, %?
13614 : I confess, the thought had occurred to me as well. But on reflection, I realized an ancient tome such as this would never make for a practical daily offering. Though unfortunately not the item we are searching for, please, keep it with you. And keep it safe.
13615 : Hm? What's this, then?
13616 : Why, %, of all things, whatever could have possessed you to bring me this? But, if only... No, it couldn't possibly... Could it?
13617 : An ageless armor, impenetrable, and yet of no metal wrought. Well, I suppose that is one way of stating it. The shell bug certainly is armored.
13618 : To lay at rest only the comfort of anvil-hard beds are sought. Protected from without, protecting from within, yielding naught.
13619 : I've heard it said that the shell bug is a parasite which thrives within the shells of Quadav! They derive safety from within while at the same time ridding their hosts of other disease-ridden vermin. Textbook symbiosis, really.
13620 : It could be that the anvil-hard beds is a reference to the Quadav shells preferred by the shell bug. Hmmm...
13621 : It certainly seems to fit the description, with a bit of creative interpretation. But could it be that the great wyrm of legend is interested in such a meager sacrifice?
13622 : Regardless, %, we haven't the luxury of time to continue debating over this conundrum! My desperation has come to get the better of me. I suppose there is no harm in trying.
13623 : Still, such a magnificent creature as the Eastdrake is no doubt accustomed to more...regal offerings. Simply tossing her a bug seems to be awfully lacking in tact.
13624 : I have an elaborate jeweled box that I think may be just the thing! I shall make all the necessary preparations and head to Grauberg at once!
13625 : %, the Goddess herself must have sent you to help me! Surely, I would not have been capable of weathering this storm on my own. You have my eternal thanks!
13626 : Still, who would have thought that a great wyrm, the fiercest and most majestic of beings, would derive such pleasure from a common bug? I must say, in retrospect, the whole thing is quite amusing, don't you think?
13627 : I can honestly say that I shall never forget the look of sheer satisfaction on her face when she plopped that % into her mouth. Not for all my days!
13628 : I bear a message from Captain Rahal:
13629 : The Knights of the Swiftwing Griffin are to convene at headquarters from sundown.
13630 : Captain Rahal has informed me of what transpired at the Garlaige Citadel...
13631 : ...And of Sir Vailanice's passing. The beastmen must be made to pay--I myself shall strike back and exact revenge! Er...after I become a proper knight, that is.
13632 : The War Council is about to commence. Please take your place.
13633 : Listen up, everyone.
13634 : It was as I had expected. We were not allowed to officially join the ranks of the Iron Rams.
13635 : Awww...
13636 : Curses! That captain's skull is more rigid than granite!
13637 : However, permission has been granted for us to partake in all their drills, should we wish it.
13638 : Iron Ram-style murderous military drills under the watchful, sadistic eye of Captain Rongelouts...
13639 : Uhhhn... My stomach is churning at the mere thought of it...
13640 : Hahaha, my feelings exactly. All the same, this is a grand opportunity for us to demonstrate to Captain Rongelouts that we're much more than squirming maggots.
13641 : Captain. Was there...no mention of me?
13642 : You needn't fret, Bistillot. You were specifically singled out and requested to assist with their research on the Orcish warmachine.
13643 : Research!? You...you jest not!? I shall do my utmost to earn glory and respect for the Swiftwing Griffins!
13644 : And %. I've brought something for you.
13645 : It's from Captain Rongelouts himself.
13646 : %, I've been wanting to speak with you in private for some time now.
13647 : Have you...ever been to Tavnazia?
13648 : Or, even if you haven't, perhaps you've some knowledge of it?
13649 : A-actually, never mind... You needn't tell me.
13650 : I've much to talk about with Excenmille the next time he and I meet...
13651 : And then I'll put things right between us...
13652 : What's the matter? Already beset with homesickness?
13653 : It...it's nothing, sir.
13654 : Need I remind you the consequence of not passing beyond these dunes by the night's end? The beastmen have amassed a force of unprecedented scale. Should they arrive first and lay siege to Tavnazia before we can come to her aid, all would be lost.
13655 : ...Yes, sir. I beg your pardon, sir.
13656 : Keep pace, soldier. We've much distance to cover yet.
13657 : You, there. Have you happened to come into possession of any sealed containers in your crossings with the beastmen?
13658 : Some of our bravest soldiers have recently been bringing back a number of such containers following successful invasions of beastman strongholds. Our hope was that within they would contain some sensitive intel we could exploit. Only, upon returning, all those who came in contact with these containers began to die off inexplicably, one after the other.
13659 : At present, the Allied Forces are treating these as cases of assassination by the Beastman Confederate elite. It would seem they are willing to go to any length to prevent the contents of these containers from being made known.
13660 : Should you happen to get your hands on any such container, it is imperative that you bring it back here with all haste and turn it in to an agent.
13661 : Just as we suspected. This contains a great deal of information that will prove vital to our cause. Hm, what's this? Not sure what to make of this... Doesn't seem to be terribly important. Here, why don't you hang onto it? See if you can't get some use out of it down the road.
13662 : Just as we suspected. This contains a great deal of information that will prove vital to our cause. I'll keep it here under strict supervision while we investigate its contents. Job well done, soldier.
13663 : The [Royal Army of San d'Oria/Republican Army of Bastok/Federal Forces of Windurst]'s [funds have increased/resources have increased/supplies have increased/reconnaissance has improved/skill has risen/production has risen/morale has risen/prosperity has risen]!
13664 : Oh, it'th you, er...%, wath it? Thimply gorgeouth to thee you again!
13665 : Looking for Lilithette, are you? I'm afraid you've jutht mithed her.
13666 : I'd be willing to wager a complimentary ticket the'th trotted off to the Thateau d'Oraguille again.
13667 : Both she and Porthia have made it a habit to vithit Thir Ragelithe on a regular bathith ever thinth he thuthtained that terrible wound.
13668 : The two of them have been thpending much time by hith thide ath of late. Too much, if you athk my humble opinion.
13669 : Why, I honethtly cannot recall when I latht thaw them rehearthing. I do thympathithe with them during thethe trying timeth, but I have a danthe troupe to run.
13670 : Ankleth may thprain, puth may oothe from blithterth...and loved oneth may be thtruck down by unholy magickth, but the thow mutht go on!
13671 : I've tolerated their unprofethionalithm for long enough. I mutht remind mythelf to mete out a fitting punithment for the two of them. Lilithette, ethpethially.
13672 : If you happen to run into our prodigal diva, be thure to thare with her the detailth of our converthation. The part about punithmenth, in particular.
13673 : ...Jutht a moment!
13674 : Thank you for the other day. The girlth owe you their liveth.
13675 : It theemth I wath mithtaken about you.
13676 : I mean, who would have guethed you packed thuch a punch, jutht by looking at you? You truly are full of thurpritheth!
13677 : Now, jutht between you and I...
13678 : My heart thkipped one whole beat witnething you in action back in La Vaule.
13679 : What would you thay if I were to invite you to join Troupe Mayakov, hmmm? I'll perthonally thee to your training ath my firtht and foremotht priority!
13680 : Will you join Troupe Mayakov? It-it'd be my greatetht honor! I truly am flattered, but...
13681 : <Snicker>... I wath jutht teathing! I didn't think you'd take my propothal theriouthly. My, my, hath anyone ever told you how adorable you are? Ohohohohoho!
13682 : <Snicker>... I wath jutht teathing! You really are adorable thometimeth, you know that? Oh, how I wish I could've captured the exthprethion on your fathe jutht now! Ohohohohoho!
13683 : Concerned for the wounded Sir Ragelise, Lilisette and Portia have been paying him regular visits as of late. Alexei Mayakov suggests that the Chateau d'Oraguille is where the two of them are likely to be.
13684 : Halt. Beyond here lies Northern San d'Oria and Chateau d'Oraguille, the residence of His Majesty, King Destin.
13685 : Access through this gate is not granted to commoners. If you haven't business here, begone.
13686 : What? An acquaintance of Sir Ragelise of the Knights of the Ironcrest Hawk? And the two Troupe Mayakov dancers, you say?
13687 : Even if you speak the truth, I cannot permit entry to those not in possession of pertinent documentation.
13688 : What's the matter?
13689 : Sir Vestillet! All is well, sir. I was just about to send this loiterer on [his/her] way...
13690 : Ah...you're the one from La Vaule.
13691 : This person is known to you, sir?
13692 : My acquaintance, to be sure. But moreover, a close friend of Sir Ragelise himself. You would do well to treat [him/her] with all courtesy.
13693 : I-I...
13694 : A thousand pardons, [sir/ma'am]. You are free to pass.
13695 : Oh, it's you...
13696 : Well met, % of the [/Knights of the Iron Ram/Seventh Cohors/Cobra Mercenaries]. Glad am I to see you again.
13697 : What brings you to this ramshackle part of town, if I may ask?
13698 : ...
13699 : Surely, you've come not because this sad excuse for a wound has been keeping you tossing and turning at night?
13700 : Your concern is deeply touching, but quite unnecessary.
13701 : After all, it was not by virtue of looks alone that I assumed leadership of the proud Knights of--
13702 : Ugh...
13703 : Sir Ragelise!
13704 : ...'Tis nothing.
13705 : But, milord...
13706 : %, I have a favor to ask of you.
13707 : Not a single soul can know of my wound--not those in my unit, no one.
13708 : Never has there been a time so critical for us in this accursed war. The Ironcrest Hawks were nigh annihilated at the Battle of La Theine, and it has taken me till now to painstakingly rebuild what little remained.
13709 : Soldiers cannot be sustained by rations alone. They must be nourished with hope, and instilled with confidence.
13710 : If I were to collapse--nay, if the mere word of my condition were to fall upon the soldiers' ears, all that I have labored for would have been for naught.
13711 : Can I trust you to fulfill this simple request, %?
13712 : You have my undying gratitude. I couldn't hope for a more dependable comrade than you.
13713 : The war council will be convening presently. By your leave...
13714 : Sir Ragelise...
13715 : That is always the way with him.
13716 : It takes not a trained eye to see that he weakens with each passing day.
13717 : But, in front of his knights, he'd sooner throw away his life than betray his true condition...
13718 : I worry so for him...
13719 : If the wound were to tighten its grip...
13720 : If Sir Ragelise were to fall, never to rise again...
13721 : <Sob>... The thought alone...is too much for me to bear...
13722 : What will you do? Leave her be. Comfort her.
13723 : <Sniffle> Please forgive me... Now is not the time to be succumbing to emotions. I've much to learn from you, %.
13724 : ...Thank you, %. Kind souls like you are few and far between in this age of strife.
13725 : I believe I understand now why Lilisette has taken to you.
13726 : Moonshade Wolverine, her troupe mates call her in jest, and somewhat fittingly so. But, dare to venture underneath that superficial layer, and you'll find a gentle, caring young woman who really just needs a friend.
13727 : Lilisette once shared her secret with me.
13728 : She told me of how she'd lost her parents...and of the solitude she's had to endure since they left her all alone in this world.
13729 : You'll look out for Lilisette, won't you, %?
13730 : I doubt that this will make any sense, but seeing the two of you together warms me up inside, in such a way I've never felt before...
13731 : Oh? You're looking for Lilisette?
13732 : She was mumbling something about catching a...cat? And then took off with a few other troupe members in tow but a moment ago.
13733 : There was talk of going to Jugner Forest, if I heard correctly. I wasn't privy to any more than that, I'm afraid.
13734 : According to Portia, Lilisette has left for Jugner Forest in the company of a handful of Troupe Mayakov members.
13735 : Ah, %. Crave your pardon for my recent effrontery. Sir Ragelise himself has informed me of the invaluable role you play in our nation's defense.
13736 : Please, enter at will. Your passage shall be hindered no more.
13737 : ...I beseech your reconsideration, Sir Nag'molada!
13738 : Impossible. The message has already been delivered to His Majesty the King.
13739 : But, sir, the citizenry--surely, they deserve the right to have a say in this matter.
13740 : Hm? It would appear you have visitors.
13741 : You are evidently a busy man. I will keep you from your duties no longer.
13742 : If you could spare but a few more moments, I'd like to introduce to you % of the [/Knights of the Iron Ram/Seventh Cohors of Bastok/Cobra Mercenaries of Windurst], a loyal soldier of the alliance.
13743 : Is that so...?
13744 : %, as a fellow member of the Allied Forces, I implore you to join with me in dissuading Sir Nag'molada.
13745 : Hm? Medicine, you say? That must wait. We have more urgent matters to resolve.
13746 : Sir Nag'molada, you see, has brought with him news of dire gravity from Jeuno...
13747 : It is the intent of the Duchy to surrender to the Beastman Confederate.
13748 : The beastmen have been targeting Jeuno with an unsettling singleness of mind as of late, with many fierce clashes taking place within the city's immediate vicinity.
13749 : According to Sir Nag'molada, Jeuno cannot stay the enemy's indefinite battering on its walls for much longer; that it is only a matter of time before the Duchy is completely exhausted of manpower and resources...
13750 : The archduke wishes not for the nation to continue bleeding in vain. Following lengthy and impassioned deliberation, surrender was deemed to be the sole course of action that could avert total annihilation from befalling Jeuno.
13751 : But...
13752 : The three nations, too, are advised to commence preparations for unconditional surrender.
13753 : If I may venture a proposal...
13754 : I shall seek audience with King Destin and request permission to dispatch troops to bolster Jeuno's defensive effort. In the meantime, if talk of surrender could be held in abeyance...
13755 : A generous offer, but I fear it will be in vain.
13756 : It is no secret that San d'Oria has suffered numerous stinging defeats at the hands of the beastmen. The Duchy is not so unsympathetic as to deprive your ailing army of what little remains.
13757 : Your Excellency is gracious, even in declinature.
13758 : If the Duchy finds San d'Oria's assistance alone wanting, I shall personally see to it that Bastok and Windurst, too, provide Jeuno with reinforcements.
13759 : If it please you.
13760 : ...
13761 : Sir Nag'molada!
13762 : So be it. Archduke Kam'lanaut will be informed of your proposal, but his opinion is unlikely to change.
13763 : I believe this will prove to be a royal waste of time. I take my leave of you.
13764 : ...
13765 : My lord, to where are you headed?
13766 : To see the king and request his permission to mobilize a contingent of knights for the defense of Jeuno.
13767 : Will he be alright?
13768 : ...
13769 : Something weighs heavily on your mind.
13770 : ...!
13771 : S-Sir Nag'molada...
13772 : It seems to me Sir Ragelise is unwell. A wound taken to the chest, if experience tells me true.
13773 : H-how did you--? I beg you, sir, please keep this matter in confidence.
13774 : I understand.
13775 : Thank you, milord.
13776 : ...
13777 : I know a skilled physician based in Jeuno. At your word, I can have medicine prepared to treat Sir Ragelise's affliction.
13778 : You're very kind, milord, but Lilisette and % have already brought some for him. But thank you all the same.
13779 : S-Sir Nag'molada?
13780 : I say this not lightly. I want you to come with me.
13781 : Doing so will not only be for your sake, but for that of the world also. Of this fact, you will come to realize in due time.
13782 : Wh-what are you saying? The world...?
13783 : Now, come...
13784 : ...Touch me not, sir!
13785 : A simple dancer I may be, but milord would do well to not underestimate me.
13786 : Hahaha, a spirited woman, no less than I had expected.
13787 : Pray forgive my trespass.
13788 : Phew... What was that about?
13789 : The king has granted permission for both the Ironcrest Hawks and the Iron Rams to be mobilized. The two units will depart as soon as preparations are complete.
13790 : As for me, I shall first head to the other two nations to entreat their armies' aid, and rejoin the knights in Jeuno shortly thereafter.
13791 : But, milord, you still need rest...
13792 : I will be fine. Now, I must make haste and-- Urgh...
13793 : Sir Ragelise!
13794 : It...it's nothing.
13795 : My lord, you mustn't go, not in your current condition!
13796 : No, this chance must not be wasted. Even Count Borel himself has pledged his full cooperation and will assume the role of official emissary on the mission.
13797 : Um...excuse us.
13798 : First, we've brought this medicine here for you. And, second...
13799 : % and I volunteer to undertake the journey to Bastok and Windurst in your stead.
13800 : !?
13801 : % has proven [himself/herself] to be quite a competent navigator. I guarantee you'll not find a more qualified substitute. We'll be back before you know it!
13802 : And since Monarlais Halv--errr, I mean, Count Borel will be doing all the talking at each destination, you can rest completely assured!
13803 : ...
13804 : Please consider, milord. I have every confidence that these two will not fail you.
13805 : ...Very well. %, Lilisette, I'm relying on you. The fate of Vana'diel may well be resting in your hands.
13806 : Yes, sir! Leave everything to us, sir!
13807 : Now, this way, milord. You need to lie down.
13808 : I must admit, never once in my life had I dreamed of traveling in the company of a Troupe Mayakov dancer. Not that I'm complaining, of course. Not in the least.
13809 : The pleasure is all ours, Count Borel.
13810 : My name is Lilisette, and with me here is my trusty partner, %. Together, we form the unbeatable tag-team duo, Future Fabulous!
13811 : Just to give my lord an idea of our recent accomplishments, not a few days ago, we made mincemeat out of a dark dragon. And on a separate occasion, overcame the extinction of a plantoid species!
13812 : Whatever the task, and no matter the odds, Future Fabulous shall prevail!
13813 : That's...errr, wonderful...
13814 : During these needy times, we certainly welcome all help offered us. On behalf of San d'Oria and her citizens, I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude for coming to our aid in this hour of need.
13815 : You needn't mention it, my lord. We are at your most humble service.
13816 : Now, to recap, our contact in the Federation of Windurst is Velda-Galda, of the Patriarch Protectors.
13817 : And in the Republic of Bastok, Radford, of Strategic Command. Both are acquaintances of mine.
13818 : Royal messengers have already been dispatched to inform both parties of our coming.
13819 : We should not have to wait overlong to be granted audience with the Warlock Warlord and President Prien. Now then, without further ado...
13820 : Aye aye, sir!
13821 : Can't you see that I'm occupied with my duties? I'm far too busy defending this realm from the forces of darkness to engage in idle chit-chat with ungrateful civilians like you. Now, begone!
13822 : Greetings! Your tireless efforts on behalf of the Allied Forces are well known in these parts!
13823 : What a coincidence that you stopped by. As a matter of fact, I have an offer that might prove interesting for you.
13824 : I'm not allowed to reveal my sources, but let it suffice to say that a substantial treasure hoard has been unearthed!
13825 : The area in which this treasure was found was one recently annexed to our territory thanks in no small part to your valiant efforts, so I simply had to let you in on the news.
13826 : There is one small catch, however. Word has it that a frightening monster has staked out the surrounding environs as its lair, and laid claim to the riches within.
13827 : Ordinarily a reclusive beast, it has been sighted only on the rarest of occasions. In an odd coincidence, each of the search parties that encountered it happened to be carrying a % at the time...
13828 : Curious, is it not? Yet, as the rumor has spread, many brave souls are trying to get their hands on these %, in the hope that they might draw out and slay the beast, and dispossess it of its treasure.
13829 : Where can you get your hands on one, you ask? Ohoho... What would you say if I told you that I just happen to have one with me right here?
13830 : I procured it from my...sources, just for you! After all, you have as much claim to the riches as any of those would-be treasure hunters.
13831 : Mind you, these aren't easy to come by. If we didn't swear allegiance to the same nation, I'd have to charge a fee of # Allied Notes, but...
13832 : Seeing as you're such a staunch ally to our cause, I'd be willing to let it go for only #. Do we have a deal?
13833 : Deal? (You currently possess # A.N.) Deal. No thanks.
13834 : Really proceed with the transaction? Yes. On second thought...
13835 : That's a shame.  Well, if you change your mind, I suggest you come back quickly. Now that our forces occupy the area, there's no telling when the beast might move on to greener pastures...
13836 : Wonderful! You won't regret it. With this, the treasure is as good as yours!
13837 : I'm afraid you haven't enough Allied Notes...
13838 : I'd appreciate if you could share this news with your comrades as well. A chance like this doesn't come every day, you know, and word has it there's more than enough treasure to go around.
13839 : The monster lurks within the region recently brought under [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] control. Make haste, and may the Goddess protect you!
13840 : Oh, it's you again!  Let me guess. You've come back for the %. Am I right or am I right?
13841 : How about it? Right you are. Actually, no...
13842 : Yes? I'm afraid I have no time at the moment. Come back later, and we'll talk.
13843 : Ah!
13844 : %!!!
13845 : It's me, Lilisette! You do remember me, don't you? Oh, please tell me you do!
13846 : Do you remember? How could I ever forget? You got the wrong person, lady.
13847 : R-really!? What about our tag-team duo, Future Fabulous? Do you remember that, too?
13848 : Phew... What a relief!
13849 : What!?
13850 : B-but it's me! Lilisette! How could you forget, after all we've been through?
13851 : I'm glad to see your memory is still intact, %.
13852 : ...
13853 : Hmmm...
13854 : Rather than try to explain, I think I'll just show you what's been happening. Come on, follow me!
13855 : Hm?
13856 : Yes? Something I can do for you?
13857 : Hi there! Troupe Mayakov is in the midst of preparations for a dazzling new performance! We hope to see you among the audience when the curtains are drawn!
13858 : Hm? You again!?
13859 : What is it with you? Even stubbornness has its limits, you know.
13860 : Look! How many times must I tell you? It's me, Lilisette!
13861 : <Sigh>... And how many times must I tell you? We don't have a blinking clue who you are!
13862 : (Did you see that, %? They don't recognize me...)
13863 : Then...what about % here? You don't remember [him/her], either?
13864 : Eh?
13865 : It's %! The one who stumbled into the trap we laid for that snotty talking cat out in Jugner Forest!
13866 : We don't know you, we don't know [him/her], and we certainly don't know no talking cats! How many ways do you want us to say that?
13867 : Now, away with you!
13868 : Well, that was kinda creepy...
13869 : She's probably just a harmless fan...who's slightly touched in the head. You've got to admit, though, she did a pretty good job with the outfit.
13870 : Harmless or no, I think it's best we ignore those nutty types. Ah, fame can be such a hassle at times...
13871 : Why is this happening...?
13872 : They've forgotten you, too, %.
13873 : ...
13874 : Ah! Mister Mayakov!
13875 : Mister Mayakov! Portia!
13876 : Y-y-you remember me, right? Right!?
13877 : What hath gotten into you thethe dayth?
13878 : Lilithette. You're one of the motht talented dantherth I've ever taken under my wing. But at the thame time, incredibly uncouth and unthophithticated.
13879 : You mutht learn to embrathe the grathe and eleganthe of danth in every day life ath I do. After all, thothe who with to mathter danthe, mutht allow danthe to mathter them!
13880 : M-Mister Mayakov...
13881 : Hmmmmmm?
13882 : How have you been keeping, Lilisette? Mister Mayakov and I were discussing the routine for the troupe's next performance. It would be lovely if you could join us.
13883 : In times such as these, it's the least our troupe can do to put on a show that will warm the dampened hearts of the citizens. We've even received the backing of Sir Ragelise and the knights.
13884 : <Sniff>...<sob>...
13885 : L-Lilisette? Is something the matter?
13886 : Portia!!!
13887 : ...Forgotten who you are, you thay?
13888 : Are you abtholutely thertain? Weren't they jutht pulling thome kind of dithtathteful prank?
13889 : I hate to say it, but they were dead serious. They don't even remember who % is!
13890 : It's as though the two of us have completely disappeared from their memories. But why...?
13891 : Us two from the future...disappearing...
13892 : Does this mean-- No...it can't be! The future itself is...disappearing!?
13893 : Oh, Lilithette. You're thtill going on about that?
13894 : You have to believe me, Mister Mayakov! This isn't some fool's errand I'm running!
13895 : Now, look here--
13896 : Sir, you have to admit that many a strange event has taken place since Lilisette joined us.
13897 : The strangest of all being that time back at La Vaule when Sir Ragelise was struck down by the purple-garbed fiends.
13898 : Moreover, many is the time when Lilisette has displayed knowledge of things no ordinary person could possibly know.
13899 : My senses tell me that something well beyond our comprehension is taking place...
13900 : <Sigh>... All right, all right...
13901 : I'll thare with you what little I know. It would theem that the mythteriouth pair drethed in ghathtly purple--their wardrobe coordinator thould be punithed, by the way--hath been the topic of many a dithcuthion among the knighth lately.
13902 : A knight friend of mine thaid that royal thcouth have brought back reporth of their thighting out about Valdeaunia.
13903 : Really!?
13904 : Now, before we get all exthited and act hathtily, don't forget that thethe fiendth were able to thubdue even a knight of Thir Ragelithe'th caliber.
13905 : %, we have to hurry to Valdeaunia!
13906 : Lilithette!
13907 : I beg you, Mister Mayakov! Please allow me to go!
13908 : Something terrible is about to happen...I just know it.
13909 : It feels as though everything I hold dear is being taken away from me...like the time Father and Mother died.
13910 : ...
13911 : I just can't sit by idly while this feeling eats away at my soul.
13912 : <Sigh>... Onthe your heart ith thet on thomething, there'th no talking you out of it, ith there?
13913 : Very well, then. I give you permithion to thkip your lethonth. But refrain from doing anything reckleth. Underthtood?
13914 : Thank you, Mister Mayakov!
13915 : %, Portia. I want the two of you to come with me!
13916 : I...I would, but I must stay by Sir Ragelise's side...
13917 : Portia. Why don't you go and keep them company?
13918 : But...
13919 : You needn't worry about Thir Ragelithe. It'th already been taken care of...
13920 : Beg your pardons!
13921 : Allow me to introduthe Thir Noillurie, the ethteemed Commander of the Knighth of the Red Rothe. The hath kindly volunteered to thee to Thir Ragelithe'th every need.
13922 : What...?
13923 : Please rest assured. The chateau and its amenities are familiar to me. I shall personally see to it that Sir Ragelise lacks neither for company nor comfort during his convalescence.
13924 : ...
13925 : (I'm tho thorry, Porthia. Thith wath a propothal from General Coutheraux himthelf, and I jutht couldn't thay no...)
13926 : P-Portia! We're going to find a way to remove Sir Ragelise's curse...and we'll come back straight after that!
13927 : A-all right...
13928 : I...I leave Sir Ragelise in your capable hands.
13929 : You got all that, right, %? First stop, the Beaucedine Glacier!
13930 : Ah, %! How does this day find you? You seek Sir Ragelise, I trust?
13931 : Please enter the chateau at will.
13932 : Why, %. What brings you back so soon?
13933 : Where are the others? I thought Portia and Lilisette had left in your company.
13934 : Egads! What in blazes is that black and white creature--?
13935 : Small details such as my identity can wait. Will keep until another day. Your comrade % has urgent news to divulge to you.
13936 : Wh-what!? Both Portia and Lilisette!?
13937 : Confound it! Confound it to hell!
13938 : %! I cannot believe you permitted such a thing to happen!
13939 : Eep!
13940 : What...what am I saying? The blame is not yours, but mine. Had only I been strong enough to overcome my condition...
13941 : I...I'm sorry...
13942 : Ringaling...
13943 : Please forgive me my outburst.
13944 : Wh-where are you going?
13945 : You know as well as I. I strike out for the Beaucedine Glacier.
13946 : N-no! Wait! You can't handle this on your own! We need to think before we act! Chart out each step!
13947 : !!!
13948 : Ugh... Damn this wound...
13949 : Sir Ragelise! Why are you not resting in bed?
13950 : !?
13951 : You are in no condition to be wandering about unescorted!
13952 : N-Noillurie!? I...I thought you were engaging enemy forces out at the Vunkerl Inlet...
13953 : I had indeed gone and joined the fray at the inlet. But I was there only in body, for my mind had never left you. In reconciling the two, I knew there was naught I could do save one thing: return here to be by your side.
13954 : I have no excuses to offer. My irrational behavior astonishes even myself.
13955 : It is true what they say about love...that it can drive a woman insane.
13956 : Noillurie?
13957 : I arrived here just in time to hear of your intent to go north.
13958 : It would be my honor to go forth in your stead and color the white snow of Beaucedine crimson with steaming heathen blood!
13959 : Noillurie, listen--
13960 : Say no more! For bereft of love and honor, a woman's life holds no meaning!
13961 : I-I'm not sure I follow...
13962 : Rest easy, Sir Ragelise, for distance is no obstacle for two who are bound by destiny.
13963 : Erhm...
13964 : Upon my return, I...
13965 : I would that we were joined before the Goddess.
13966 : ...
13967 : Company, fall in!
13968 : Hahaha, the trials and tribulations of a heartthrob...
13969 : <Sigh> This is no laughing matter.
13970 : I know, and envy you not in the least. I came here not to mock, but to say that I, too, will depart for the north.
13971 : I assume you're already aware of the Allied Forces' preemptive strategy underway there?
13972 : Some time ago, it came to light that the beastmen were amassing a sizeable force out in Valdeaunia.
13973 : Noillurie's unit and my own have been assigned the task of laying an ambush.
13974 : What? I've heard of no such thing. Why have my Ironcrest Hawks not been called?
13975 : The war is far from over, my friend, and you, far from fully healed. Likely, General Cousseraux deemed it best that your unit is kept in reserve for a more dire time.
13976 : I cannot abide by this. I will not be left behind.
13977 : Ragelise, listen to me. The war is already lost if we knight captains cannot distinguish between duty and personal affairs.
13978 : Consider this. Should the operation fail, and you were to fall with us, the kingdom's defenses would be severely compromised. All would be lost.
13979 : Now, tell me. Portia...is she in danger?
13980 : Aye...
13981 : I thought as much. You just sit tight and leave this matter to us.
13982 : Ooh, ooh! Don't forget Lilisette! Lilisette's in danger, too!
13983 : Hm? Understood.
13984 : I'm counting on you...
13985 : (%! This is the chance we've been waiting for! An opening!)
13986 : (While the Madder Falcons and the Red Roses hold any encroaching enemies at bay...)
13987 : (You and I will attempt to locate Lilisette and Portia! Extricate the two damsels!)
13988 : (Let's go and ask Vestillet and Noillurie for permission to join their company!)
13989 : Hm? Why, you're the one who so rudely interrupted my private interlude with Sir Ragelise...
13990 : If you've yet to be introduced, this here is %, one of Ragelise's closest friends.
13991 : Ask for permission? Take me with you! On second thought...
13992 : (No, you mustn't chicken out now! Think about poor Lilisette and Portia! Their two lives are at stake!)
13993 : Hm? You wish to accompany our units north so as to rescue the two Troupe Mayakov dancers?
13994 : Having had the honor of fighting alongside you in La Vaule, I know full well your battle prowess. However--
13995 : Absolutely out of the question!
13996 : Aye... 'Tis unfortunate, but I fear I cannot extend my hand in welcome.
13997 : Our orders come from above, and it is not our decision to make.
13998 : Above all else, I'll not allow my unit's integrity to be compromised by unproven personnel.
13999 : (Unproven? What nerve! %! Surely, you'll not take this insult lying down? Be walked all over?)
14000 : What will you do? Show some backbone. Give up and go home.
14001 : (Yes! That's the spirit, %! Show them the kind of mettle you're made of!)
14002 : (Hissssss! Well I never! A fool I was to ever place my confidence in you! Extend my trust!)
14003 : Hmm... Sir Ragelise does seem to hold you in some regard...
14004 : Very well. I shall hence retire temporarily to undertake my pre-departure purification ritual.
14005 : During which time, bring us that which can attest to your martial prowess.
14006 : A close friend of Sir Ragelise would surely lack not for recognition among Kingdom troops.
14007 : Ah yes, a fine proposal. What better way for % to prove [his/her] worth than with the endorsement of our own soldiers?
14008 : %. Seek out the knights within the Kingdom's walls for their support in writing.
14009 : Something upwards of around # signatures should suffice.
14010 : Naturally, more signatures can only lend greater weight to your cause.
14011 : Do your best to put your credentials beyond doubt, and we shall negotiate with our superiors on your behalf.
14012 : Then it is agreed. Waste no time, though, for war waits for no woman.
14013 : You must gather signatures from at least # knights of the Kingdom.
14014 : Current %: #.
14015 : What? You wish me to sign your petition?
14016 : Pardon my asking, but am I correct in assuming you are % of the [/Knights of the Iron Ram/Seventh Cohors of Bastok/Cobra Mercenaries of Windurst]?
14017 : Haha, I knew it! Much have I heard of your valorous deeds at the Battle of Jeuno! You have my wholehearted support, and not the least, my signature!
14018 : How may I be of assistance? Hm? A signature, you say?
14019 : But of course! How could I refuse, knowing you're the esteemed % of the [/Knights of the Iron Ram/Seventh Cohors of Bastok/Cobra Mercenaries of Windurst]?
14020 : So you'll strike out for the Northlands with the Madder Falcons? I shall pray for your safety and success on the battlefront.
14021 : You would have my signature? It would be my pleasure!
14022 : Not that I give signatures to anyone who asks, mind you. You're a good friend of Sir Ragelise's, are you not?
14023 : From what I understand, Sir Ragelise has taken ill recently. As his trusted comrade, I have faith that you will be there for him in his time of need.
14024 : Hm? What's this talk of signatures?
14025 : Why, if it isn't % of the [/Knights of the Iron Ram/Seventh Cohors of Bastok/Cobra Mercenaries of Windurst], the [man/woman] of the moment! The Kingdom's walls resound with praise for you!
14026 : I've heard much of you from Sir Ragelise. In fact, there's a note of pride in his voice every time he brings your name up in conversation. Any friend of Sir Ragelise's is a friend of mine!
14027 : Let us never give up the fight for the survival of all that is good in this world. May the blessing of the Goddess be upon us!
14028 : Wh-who goes there!?
14029 : Egads! Startle me not, [man/woman]! I might have lopped off your head!
14030 : What? You wish to join our forces north, and so are gathering signatures?
14031 : I certainly have no reason to refuse such a request from one who offers to give to the Kingdom. Go well.
14032 : Hm? Gathering signatures, you say?
14033 : So you seek to join the Madder Falcons and the Red Roses on their mission to the Northlands...
14034 : I'll lend my name to your cause, lest I be branded a quill-pincher. But whether a sheet of parchment scribbled with names would have any weight with the higher-ups...
14035 : Eh? You're petitioning to join our northbound troops?
14036 : Hmm... The Madder Falcons suffered heavy losses at the Battle of La Theine, and would benefit from every extra sword they can get.
14037 : Very well. You have my signature, and my blessing, too.
14038 : What's that you say? You require signatures in order to go to Valdeaunia and snatch the Troupe Mayakov dancers out from the jaws of death?
14039 : Is this t-true? Th-that the girls are in grave danger?
14040 : M-my apologies. I meant not to lose my composure over the news. I would be glad indeed to lend my voice to your cause.
14041 : <Sigh>... Would that I could leave my post and go rescue those beauties myself...
14042 : Ah, you must be Sir Ragelise's trusted comrade, %. How fare you?
14043 : ...So that's why you're seeking signatures. I understand your predicament, and empathize with your cause. My name alone may not count for much, but I offer it without reserve.
14044 : Sir Ragelise is a great knight and an even greater man. His courage and valor have earned him the deep respect of the entire San d'Orian army.
14045 : A San d'Oria bereft of his inspirational leadership would be utterly unimaginable in these dark times.
14046 : Hm? Gathering signatures, are we?
14047 : So Sir Vestillet and Sir Noillurie and their respective units are bound for Valdeaunia...
14048 : Pundits say that a fierce battle the likes of which has yet to be seen is set to erupt there.
14049 : An extra hand to help thin out the beastman ranks cannot hurt, surely. You have my vote.
14050 : What? You're gathering signatures for a petition to be allowed to head north with our troops?
14051 : I'm presently off duty, but I suppose that's neither here nor there...
14052 : They say that the Northlands is a field of horrors, a veritable burial ground for the unprepared. If you must go, take all necessary precautions, and more...
14053 : ...Lest you have the ill fortune of stumbling into one of those fell creatures that prowl the Beaucedine Glacier.
14054 : What prowls the Beaucedine Glacier? Raptors. Smilodons. Imps.
14055 : And not to mention the dreadful beasts that call Xarcabard their home...
14056 : What calls Xarcabard its home? Yagudo. Tauri. Gnoles.
14057 : But of all the fearsome creatures that inhabit the glacier and Xarcabard both, none curdles the blood more than...
14058 : What inhabits both regions? Gnoles. Smilodons. Ghosts.
14059 : What are you saying? Such creatures cannot be found there.
14060 : Yes, yes. Those are the creatures of which I speak. Lower your guard not for a second in their presence, or you'll find yourself homebound...in a casket.
14061 : Very well. Wait here while I have my comrades add their signatures to my own.
14062 : Here you are. May the Goddess watch over you.
14063 : Hm? Gathering signatures for a petition, you say?
14064 : That can wait. The Kingdom requires your cooperation for a more pressing matter.
14065 : I've been tasked, you see, with compiling a report detailing the military structure of the Beastman Confederate. It would put my mind at ease if I could crosscheck a number of facts with someone prior to submitting the final product to my commanding officer.
14066 : Marvelous! I knew I could count on your aid! Now then, without further ado, my first question is with regards to the pigmen: how many Orcish units are scattered across Quon?
14067 : How many Orcish units? One. Three. Four.
14068 : Moving on. What is the name of the unit led by the Orcish general One-eyed Gwajboj at the Battle of Jeuno?
14069 : The name of One-eyed Gwajboj's unit? Gravemakers. Gutrenders. Dismemberment Brigade.
14070 : I see, I see... This brings me to the last question: what is the name of the Orc leader who commands the Orcish Hosts on Quon?
14071 : The name of the Orc leader? Grradhod. Rojgnoj. Gnadgad.
14072 : Your ambition far exceeds your knowledge, it seems. I fear I cannot in good conscience vouch for one such as you to join our forces north. Speak with me again after you've reviewed your military intelligence.
14073 : Hmmm, a sharp mind to match your sharp reflexes, I see.
14074 : My apologies for having doubted you. I had to make certain that you would not be a liability if sent to the frontlines.
14075 : Wait here a moment.
14076 : I've had other members of my unit sign your petition as well. Good luck.
14077 : What's that? You would have me sign a petition?
14078 : I suppose you fancy yourself well-versed in all things to do with the San d'Orian army. All right, let's do it this way. You answer a few questions, and I'll give you what you seek.
14079 : Any fool off the street knows the Kingdom's three knightly orders: the Royal Knights, the Temple Knights, and the Royal Guards.
14080 : But know you who stands at the helm of each?
14081 : The leader of the Royal Knights is... Rahal S Lebrart. Yrvaulair S Cousseraux. Febrenard C Brunnaut.
14082 : The leader of the Temple Knights is... Curilla V Mecru. Yrvaulair S Cousseraux. Febrenard C Brunnaut.
14083 : The leader of the Royal Guards is... Altedour I Tavnazia. Valaineral R Davilles. Ragelise B Baloumat.
14084 : Next question. As you know, the Kingdom is served by a great many regiments of knights. Which of the following does not exist?
14085 : Which does not exist? Knights of the Cardinal Stag. Knights of the Rustwing Hawk. The Royal Guards.
14086 : I'm sorry, but you must do better than that if you wish for my name to grace your petition.
14087 : Very good. You've demonstrated satisfactory knowledge of the Kingdom's forces. Wait right here. I shall return presently.
14088 : Here are the signatures I promised. I took the liberty of having fellow unit members sign your petition also.
14089 : Hm? What is it?
14090 : Ah, so you're the one rumored to be scurrying about gathering signatures. I suppose it was only a matter of time before you found your way here.
14091 : Your determination is deserving of admiration, but that alone will not win wars.
14092 : And considering how it may send a [man to his/woman to her] death, I'll not put my name to parchment lightly.
14093 : I shall quiz you with regards to San d'Oria's allies. After all, any member of the Allied Forces worth [his/her] salt should have a basic understanding of the state of affairs. Answer satisfactorily, and my signature is at your disposal.
14094 : My first question concerns our allies down south. Who is the current President of the Republic of Bastok?
14095 : The president of Bastok is... Franz Werner. Derek Karst. Uwe Prien.
14096 : All right. And what is the name of the special unit under the direct command of the president?
14097 : The name of the unit is... The Iron Musketeers. The Gold Musketeers. The Mythril Musketeers.
14098 : And who is the serving captain of the Mythril Musketeers?
14099 : The serving captain is... Klara Bester. Volker. Bartholomaus Krueger.
14100 : The next question concerns our Mindartian allies. Who holds the post of commander-in-chief of the Windurstian forces?
14101 : Windurst's commander-in-chief is.. Lehko Habhoka. Ajido-Marujido. Robel-Akbel.
14102 : Moving on. How many units comprise the War Warlocks, Windurst's spellcasting elite?
14103 : How many War Warlock units are there? Three. Twelve. Thirteen.
14104 : Fighting fang and claw alongside the ranks of the War Warlocks, we have the Mithran Mercenaries.
14105 : Who amongst the following isn't a mercenary major?
14106 : Who isn't a mercenary major? Perih Vashai. Choh Moui. Haja Zhwan.
14107 : I fear your dearth of knowledge on the Allied Forces does not instill me with sufficient confidence to support your cause. My shift will keep me here for some time, though, should you wish to try again.
14108 : Outstanding! Your sound knowledge of the Kingdom's allies is proof positive that you are a staunch soldier of the Allied Forces!
14109 : Here, take this. You'll find not only my signature, but those of my fellow unit members also. May it serve you well.
14110 : Is something the matter? What's that? You desire my signature?
14111 : Why, nothing would give me more pleasure than to assist a comrade in need! As I'm sure, you wouldn't hesitate to extend a helping hand were I to beseech your aid. Speaking of which...I've a favor to ask of you.
14112 : I'm low on my supply of %, you see. Might I trouble you to fetch some for me? The big fellow here has such an appetite as would make paupers out of princes!
14113 : That would be % I require, and the more the merrier!
14114 : Thank you kindly! While you were away, I had my fellow knights sign their names on your petition also. I hope you don't mind.
14115 : Be ever vigilant out there, you hear?
14116 : Yes? You've business with me?
14117 : Gathering signatures, you say? You may have mine...for a small favor in return.
14118 : My latest inspection of the army's inventory has revealed that our supply of % nears the bottom of the barrel.
14119 : Procure a goodly amount for me and I shall see to it that more names are added to your petition.
14120 : Our army is low on %. Bring as many as you can.
14121 : Ah, you're back, and with the requested items, I see. You have my thanks. Here, you've earned this.
14122 : Signatures? What are you going on about?
14123 : Urrrgh... I'm so famished, I can scarce comprehend your words.
14124 : Aaah, if the Goddess would grant me any dish of my choosing right now, it would have to be...beans! Yes, beans!
14125 : A bean dish, a bean dish, my signature for a bean dish!
14126 : As long as it's made from beans, I care not the slightest what dark crevasse it came from! But...<slurp>...I do have a soft spot for %.
14127 : This unmistakable aroma...! Altana be praised!
14128 : Here's my signature as promised, and those of my fellow Iron Rams also. Now then, without further ado--! Um...you wouldn't perchance have a spoon I might borrow?
14129 : What? You're petitioning for permission to join our troops to the Northlands?
14130 : While you seem to be possessed of some battle experience, I'll not attest to it unless absolutely certain you would be a valuable addition to our forces.
14131 : Let's do it this way. A soldier who fancies [his/her] chances in Valdeaunia should break not a single bead of sweat when pitted against Orcs.
14132 : Bring me a piece of equipment taken from a felled Orc to prove your prowess, and my name will adorn your petition.
14133 : That's one piece of equipment from an Orc I require. Until you bring what I ask, we've nothing further to discuss.
14134 : Hm? Be that % I see?
14135 : You've measured up to my expectations. I shall honor my promise.
14136 : Take this with my blessing. Others in my unit learned of your plight and have contributed their names also.
14137 : Go forth then, and do unto the enemy as they've done unto us. Keep in mind, though, that a soldier is only valuable so long as [he/she] draws breath. Know your limits, and you may live to fight another day.
14138 : Hm? [/What business have you here, maggot?/And who do you presume to be...?/And who do you presume to be...?]
14139 : What? You wish to join our army's expedition to Valdeaunia, and want my signature for the petition?
14140 : Your insolence knows no bounds, maggot. You either have nerves of steel or are as thick as behemoth hide to so flippantly demand such a thing of me.
14141 : It will be my distinct pleasure to personally backhand some discipline into you. Eyes front!
14142 : First lesson of the day: a soldier's worth is measured by [his/her] actions, not words. Now, go and fetch me %, posthaste!
14143 : %, I said! Have you sawdust for brains? Make me repeat myself once more, and your pouting lips will find themselves at odds with my gauntlet!
14144 : Hm? So you've somehow managed to find %. Not bad...for a worthless maggot.
14145 : Where's my signature, you say? Hah! I withdraw my behemoth hide comment. Why, you're thicker than one of Tavnazia's defensive walls!
14146 : Eyes front! Next in the order of business: RPS training!
14147 : Hm? Haven't had enough pain, you say? In that case, I'd be happy to oblige! We shall pick things up from the %...
14148 : ...Is what I would say ordinarily, but I haven't anymore of my precious time to waste on a single, squirming maggot.
14149 : We shall resume from the RPS training. Keep your posture ram-rod straight, and your mind on high alert. Eyes front!
14150 : Do you need everything to be spelled out for you? Alternatively, if you intend to scamper off with your tail between your legs, now's the time.
14151 : Do you require an explanation? No, thank you. Yes, please.
14152 : RPS is a revolutionary training method developed by the Kingdom, for the Kingdom. The R stands for Rock, the P stands for Phantom, and the S stands for Scorpion.
14153 : In this training, you must choose from one of the following to use as your weapon:
14154 : A congealed volcanic rock, a sheet of nether vellum, or a scorpion stinger.
14155 : I, on the other hand, will unleash a ferocious monster upon you.
14156 : 'Tis unfortunate and takes away from the thrill, I know, but the monsters I produce will be mere illusions. You shan't be requiring diapers.
14157 : Your challenge is to predict, based on my movements, the monster I intend to set loose so as to choose the most effective weapon to strike against it.
14158 : Do you require a more detailed explanation of RPS Training?
14159 : Listen to a detailed explanation? No, sir. Yes, sir.
14160 : Very well. First: Rock! The unyielding density of the rock makes it impervious to blows from enemies. Rocks are the favored foundation upon which defense is built!
14161 : Next: Phantom! This apparition will envelop its foes in a shroud of deadly curses. Beware these spectral assassins of the Underworld!
14162 : And last but not least: Scorpion! The razor-sharp stinger of this creature can rip right through opponents. Scorpions are the shock troopers of arthropod society!
14163 : The rock's uncompromising hardness will shatter the scorpion's stinger...
14164 : ...But be ineffective against the insidious curses of the phantom.
14165 : The phantom's diaphanous form will cloak the rock in ethereal curses...
14166 : ...But be easily ripped to pieces by the scorpion's stinger.
14167 : The scorpion's menacing stinger will tear the phantom to shreds...
14168 : ...But break against the unbending surface of the rock.
14169 : Through RPS training, soldiers are instilled with the observation skills necessary to identify and exploit an enemy's weakness. Naturally, luck too has a role to play in the outcome, as it does on the battlefield. Were you able to digest all that, maggot?
14170 : Now then. Let us begin. The first to win three rounds shall be declared the victor.
14171 : Round #! Fight!
14172 : You've # [win/wins] and # [defeat/defeats].
14173 : RPS!
14174 : Choose your weapon! Volcanic rock. Nether vellum. Scorpion stinger.
14175 : Not bad, maggot! Not bad! But the fight isn't over yet!
14176 : Hah! Consider yourself fortunate!
14177 : Fool! Were you paying any attention to my movements?
14178 : You disappoint me, maggot! Go reflect on your failure and return when you've unraveled the true essence of RPS!
14179 : Well done, maggot! That concludes your training!
14180 : I've added # [signature/signatures] to your petition. Take it, and serve the Kingdom well.
14181 : Hm? Why are you still dawdling about here? Aren't you supposed to report back to Sir Vestillet and Sir Noillurie?
14182 : For whose sake do you think they delay departure, maggot? Keep them waiting any longer, and mark my words, I'll drag you kicking and screaming myself.
14183 : How fare you, %? Sir Vestillet and Sir Noillurie have been expecting you.
14184 : You're finally back.
14185 : I see you've gathered # [signature/signatures] for the petition. Are you ready to submit it?
14186 : Submit the petition? Gather more signatures. Yes, please.
14187 : Are you certain? On second thought... I surely am.
14188 : Such a plentiful amount of signatures... You've proven your reputation beyond all doubt, %.
14189 : Truth be told, the instant I set the task upon you, I wondered whether I was being unreasonable in my demands. But it seems my worries were unfounded.
14190 : I'm of the same sentiment. Please accept our apologies, and this also as a small token of our regret for having scrutinized you needlessly.
14191 : With this many knights rallying behind you, no one will have any grounds to question your joining us.
14192 : Very well, %. It would be our pleasure to have you accompany us to the Northlands.
14193 : Our units will depart for the Beaucedine Glacier presently.
14194 : We shall see you there.
14195 : # point(s).
14196 : Ah, greetings, %. Glad am I to see you returned unscathed.
14197 : Sir Ragelise awaits within. Please come with me, if you will.
14198 : Um...Sir Ragelise...
14199 : Please forgive us. We...we failed to rescue Portia.
14200 : Well, that's a half-truth of sorts, to be honest. She was deceived and willingly--
14201 : Beg your pardons, but have we met?
14202 : What?
14203 : Your outfit tells me you're a dancer from Troupe Mayakov, though I must confess, I do not recall having had the pleasure of seeing you on stage.
14204 : !?
14205 : With regards to Portia, Sir Vestillet came and briefed me on the situation but a moment ago.
14206 : On behalf of the Royal Knights, I apologize that a civilian has been put in harm's way. On my honor, I swear I shall not rest until she is safely returned to within the Kingdom's walls.
14207 : No...
14208 : <Sob, sniffle>...
14209 : %...
14210 : Even Father...<sob>...has forgotten about me.
14211 : What's going to happen?
14212 : The future we came from...<sniff>...is it really going to disappear?
14213 : Should things continue as they are, your future is grim indeed.
14214 : The enemy always seems to be one step ahead of us. Have the upper hand.
14215 : Unless the tides can be turned, and soon, your very existence is at stake.
14216 : ...
14217 : But what can we do? I've tried so hard...<sob>...yet nothing seems to change.
14218 : Is it because I'm...too weak?
14219 : Would we stand a chance of winning...<sniff>...if I were stronger and more grown-up...like that Lady Lilith?
14220 : I understand you'll strike out for Valdeaunia, sir.
14221 : Aye.
14222 : A battle of colossal proportion is set to be joined in Xarcabard. I will take to the field with the Ironcrest Hawks.
14223 : If I may venture to speculate your true objective, sir...
14224 : ...?
14225 : Portia--your wish is to rescue her, is it not?
14226 : I... No. My duty is to serve the Kingdom.
14227 : So all other concerns--Portia's welfare included--are relegated to secondary status...
14228 : Precious little good though it may do, sir, you have my sympathy.
14229 : It...cannot be helped.
14230 : If I could again be forgiven my audacity, are you certain this is how you wish things to be?
14231 : Let us suppose that the Allied Forces triumphed over the beastmen.
14232 : But victory came at a price most dear: the life of your beloved. Would a future bereft of her tender presence hold any meaning?
14233 : Thoughts such as these are racing through your mind, I'm sure.
14234 : ...
14235 : Far be it from my station to advise you, sir, but is it not time you became true to your feelings?
14236 : But, I...
14237 : 'Tis not an easy decision to make, choosing between love and duty. If I could be permitted to speak but once more, I've one final suggestion to offer...
14238 : Pull yourself together, lass. Now isn't the time to be sulking. Crying into your knees.
14239 : <Sob, sniff>...
14240 : Remember always that you are the chosen ones! The Champions of the Dawn!
14241 : Hand-picked out of obscurity by my noble kin and I!
14242 : Have faith in who you are and take pride in what you do, for numerous are those who rely upon you! Isn't that right, %?
14243 : What will you do? Offer words of encouragement. Give her a royal scolding.
14244 : (No, no, no! Chastising her will have the opposite effect! A young girl's heart is delicate beyond reckoning! Unimaginably fragile!)
14245 : But...but...
14246 : (Go on, %! Say something else to cheer her up! Append a few words!)
14247 : What will you say? We'll get through this together! Stick with me and it'll be okay. I'll be beside you to the bitter end...
14248 : Thank you, %. I'm feeling a little better now.
14249 : Just the knowledge that I'm not alone...that you're with me gives me heart. I'll stay strong from now on. I promise!
14250 : Cait Sith. You said that two futures are in contention for survival. What must we do to ensure the continued existence of our own?
14251 : Wh-what? You're asking me? Um, ah...infinite possibilities...<mumble>...unaccountable factors...<mutter>...
14252 : <Sigh> Are you really a servant of the Goddess? Your lack of solutions makes me wonder sometimes...
14253 : Come on, %. We'll put our heads together and figure this out.
14254 : Let's begin by reviewing the knowledge we have so far on the enemy.
14255 : First of all, where did Lady Lilith and her lackeys come from?
14256 : Lady Lilith is from... Present day Vana'diel. The Vana'diel of the past. The Vana'diel of the future.
14257 : Are you sure about that? Think about it carefully, %.
14258 : And what kind of world is that?
14259 : It's a world where... War has yet to begin. War has yet to end. War has ended.
14260 : And %, where do you think the key to victory lies?
14261 : The key to victory lies with... Lady Lilith's scanty attire. The number of Spitewardens. The Crystal War.
14262 : That's right. Their future is one where the Crystal War never ended.
14263 : Which means that at some point in the war is a decisive moment, a point of divergence from which two futures branch out.
14264 : Yes, yes. A sound assumption.
14265 : Do you recall the glowing object rising towards the heavens when you had felled the band of demons at the glacier?
14266 : True to its mindless nature, Atomos is devouring the future indiscriminately.
14267 : So when we defeated the demons, a fragment of their future was devoured...?
14268 : It is as a game of chess, wherein two sides struggle for dominion with a limited number of pieces at their disposal.
14269 : Chess pieces...
14270 : Portia...
14271 : It's becoming clear to me now. Making sense. With Portia in their grasp, they intend to execute the next move...
14272 : ...At the Battle of Xarcabard!
14273 : It's highly likely that some movement on their part can be observed there. New developments.
14274 : Then this is what we must do.
14275 : We take back Portia and all our chess pieces--for in doing so, we reclaim our future!
14276 : And to prevent any more of your future from being devoured, we must reduce the tears of suffering. Put an end to the Crystal War.
14277 : That woman...
14278 : She called Portia...Mother...
14279 : That she did. So she said.
14280 : ...
14281 : Well, she's gravely mistaken if she thinks she can keep Portia.
14282 : I'll bring her back...whatever it takes!
14283 : The hour of reckoning is nigh.
14284 : Spitewardens. Make ready for war.
14285 : You have gathered # [signature/signatures] for the %!
14286 : Clap clap!
14287 : Mister Mayakov, allow me first of all to thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to speak with us here today.
14288 : Now if you would, sir, please share with us the inspiration behind this, your latest show.
14289 : It would be my pleathure. Ath I'm thure you all know by now, when it cometh to the purthuit of artithtic beauty and exthellenthe, my Troupe Mayakov knowth no boundth.
14290 : It matterth not a whit whether we thtand before the royal throne, or within the very bowelth of hell! Troupe Mayakov will continue to danthe no matter what the thircumthantheth!
14291 : Even thould the abyth be our dethtinathion, I, Alekthei Mayakov, thall danthe to the end of dayth!
14292 : Bravo! Bravo!
14293 : Ah, %! Over here!
14294 : Thank you for coming. You must've heard about the send-off?
14295 : You hadn't? Why am I not surprised? To educate you, the knights are being treated to a dance performance on the eve of their departure for Valdeaunia.
14296 : I'm sure you were present for Mister Mayakov's interview. Did anything about his interaction with the journalists strike you as odd?
14297 : Noticed anything unusual? The strangely familiar speech. The flamboyant gestures.
14298 : I'm glad to hear it didn't escape everyone's attention. Those flowery words dripping like nectar from his mouth--I know I heard something uncannily similar not so long ago.
14299 : Did you take a knock on the head, %? Why, I'd be deeply concerned if his gesturing were any less flamboyant!
14300 : Here's my theory. This blurring of history and waning of memories could only be the work of Atomos.
14301 : It's devouring time as it sees fit and doing a rather shoddy job of patching together the shreds.
14302 : Lilithette! How're the girlth thuppothed to rehearth while you're out here thothialithing? Hurry up inthide thith inthtant!
14303 : I-I'll be right there, Mister Mayakov.
14304 : I must go and prepare.
14305 : But %. Just this night, let's forget all the unsettling events of late and enjoy ourselves to the fullest. Okay?
14306 : Oooh! Thir Ragelithe of the Knighth of the Ironcretht Hawk. You do Troupe Mayakov the highetht honor by blething uth with your ethteemed prethenthe!
14307 : We have been bethide ourthelveth with the antithipathion of your arrival, thir! The finetht theat in the houthe hath been prepared for your viewing pleathure and comfort!
14308 : You have my thanks.
14309 : Why, if it ithn't %! There'th a theat inthide with your name on it!
14310 : It'th fabulouth to have you here, but I'm afraid young Lilithette won't be grathing the thtage tonight. The other girlth inthitht they don't remember her, and they jutht can't theem to keep in time. <Thigh>...
14311 : ...
14312 : Ladies and gentlemen! On behalf of Troupe Mayakov, I extend to you our warmest welcome.
14313 : Tonight, we have prepared a special performance to honor the brave knights who will soon leave hearth and home behind to march for the frozen north. Please join me now in a spirited round of applause for these indefatigable defenders of San d'Oria!
14314 : Thank you, thank you. At this juncture, I would like to call upon Sir Ragelise of the Knights of the Ironcrest Hawk to say a few words on behalf of the Kingdom's knights.
14315 : Ahem! Please make yourselves at ease.
14316 : Before I begin, I would like to say that I stand before you as an equal. For truly, no man or woman here is less worthy than I to be given the stage.
14317 : The fire of war has raged across the realm, from Jugner and La Theine to the very gates of our fair city. In this age of strife, 'tis all too easy to succumb to despair.
14318 : ...
14319 : But never must we lose heart. For though the sun may set, it most assuredly will rise again. Then we may behold the light of morn banishing the darkness.
14320 : The beastmen may rend our flesh and batter our walls, but never will they shatter our courage. Though blade may break, and quiver be spent of shaft and bolt...never shall our hope fade.
14321 : With our brothers and sisters of the alliance fighting by our side, we shall weather this storm and emerge triumphant! For the children of Altana!
14322 : On the morrow, Allied commanders shall convene in Jeuno for a strategy meeting. The final stage of the Northern expedition is nigh, and when it finally commences, rest will become a distant memory for us all.
14323 : So let tonight be a time of unbridled joy and merriment. Revel, my friends! Revel to your hearts' content!
14324 : ...
14325 : Doeth the entertainment not pleathe you, Thir Ragelithe?
14326 : I am most pleased, Alexei, I assure you. Yet I cannot deny that the stage feels eerily empty, bereft of her presence.
14327 : ...
14328 : I've been meaning to ask a favor of you.
14329 : Then athk away, my good thir! If there'th anything thith thimple danther can do to be of thervithe, nothing would give him more pleathure!
14330 : Then I shall be frank. We are short-handed for the upcoming operation.
14331 : Ohohoho! You'd have the dantherth of Troupe Mayakov fight at your thide? Conthider it done!
14332 : Loath as I am to disappoint, fleet-footed message runners, not warriors, are what I require.
14333 : Awww... And poor little me wath dethperately hoping to thee thome acthion...
14334 : Success in an operation of such grand scale, you see, rests upon perfect synchrony between the nations. Thus the need for the swift relaying of information.
14335 : Your troupe's is a recognized and respected name across the realm. Further, I know full well that your people can hold their own in battle should the need arise, heaven forfend. I would be loath to entrust a role of such import to any other.
14336 : Oh, you have thuch a way with wordth, Thir Ragelithe! If that'th the tathk you'd have uth do, then look no further than Lilithette and thith [thtrapping lad/winthome lath] here.
14337 : A pleasure to make your acquain--
14338 : I say...have we met?
14339 : I fumble to express myself, but my heart tells me our paths have crossed previously...
14340 : A-ahem! I pray you do not misinterpret my intentions, my lady. My profoundest apologies if I have given offense.
14341 : ...
14342 : Allow me to introduthe Lilithette, my brightetht young danther. Bethide her ith %, our troupe'th number one thupporter.
14343 : You'll be pleathed to know that %'th a decorated member of the [tag-team duo, Future Fabulouth/Iron Ramth/Seventh Cohorth/Cobra Merthenarieth].
14344 : You've set my mind at ease, my friend. Once again I find myself sinking deeper into your debt. Now then, without further ado, I shall set you two your first assignment.
14345 : Pray make for Jeuno immediately upon the conclusion of the festivities. I shall brief you regarding the details of the operation thence. May the Goddess speed your way.
14346 : Ah, Mister Mayakov! %!
14347 : There you are, Lilithette.
14348 : The thingth you've been telling me...they were all true.
14349 : Huh?
14350 : Being erathed from peopleth' memorieth--a debonair gentleman of Thir Ragelithe'th caliber wouldn't think to indulge in thuch a tathteleth jetht.
14351 : You do have a point...
14352 : Pluth there'th thtill no thign of Porthia. What in the Goddeth'th good name ith happening to my girlth?
14353 : In light of thethe rethent, inexthplicable eventh, I've dethided to take a grand jet of faith...and believe your fantathtical taleth of time traveling.
14354 : <Sigh>... It took you a while, Mister Mayakov, but I'm glad that you've finally come around.
14355 : You two are up againtht thothe fathion-challenged fiendth, aren't you?
14356 : You p-poor thingth... I can't imagine how f-frightening it mutht have been at t-timeth.
14357 : You don't have to worry, Mister Mayakov! After all, I'm the Moonshade Butterfly, Troupe Mayakov's rising star!
14358 : What's more, I have % to back me up. Together, we form Future Fabulous, the tag-team duo that simply can't be beat!
14359 : Hehehe. Your youthful optimithm did alwayth raithe my thpirith.
14360 : Mister Mayakov. I want to thank you for your kindness. Looking after me when I first joined the troupe...drilling me on the finer points of the Kriegstanz...
14361 : To be honetht, there wath hardly anything left for me to do. It wath ath if you'd been danthing thinthe you were inthide the womb. Did you ever retheive training under anyone?
14362 : Truth be told, Mother did teach me a thing or two.
14363 : One latht thing, Lilithette, %. Whenever you feel like thingth are pirouetting out of control, remember that you can alwayth theek refuge here.
14364 : I'm not about to forget my own troupe'th pothter girl...or her truthty thidekick. That'th a promithe.
14365 : Th-thank you, Mister Mayakov!
14366 : Now that all the formalities are settled, we can get back to focusing on our mission. Something's brewing in Xarcabard... I can feel it in the pit of my stomach.
14367 : With me, %! Next stop, the Grand Duchy of Jeuno!
14368 : You would waste my time with such claptrap!? Do you take me for a fool!?
14369 : F-forgive me, Captain, sir, but eyewitness accounts had grown too numerous to disregard. Despite my own skepticism, I judged it best you were informed.
14370 : The occurrences have stirred disquiet among even the Cardinal Stags' most seasoned veterans, to say naught of fresh recruits.
14371 : Utterly absurd! You expect me to believe that Count Aurchiat has returned from the dead? I shall personally set straight any cowards in my ranks found clattering teeth at ghost stories!
14372 : Hm? Oh, it's you, %.
14373 : You. See that the discussed matter is kept private, lest you provoke unwarranted alarm among our men. Dismissed!
14374 : Sir!
14375 : %. You were present for the bulk of that exchange, yes?
14376 : The Cardinal Stags are instrumental in the Allied campaign against Castle Zvahl. It would serve us ill to have them falling prey to their own minds.
14377 : Make haste to Xarcabard, %, to the Cardinal Stags' encampment. Dubious rumors aside, I would know the soundness of their morale.
14378 : The Allied Forces are locked in battle with the beastmen in Xarcabard. Many a skirmish has reportedly taken place right before the gates of Castle Zvahl!
14379 : <Gasp>! %!
14380 : Wh-where have you been all this time? Without you around...<sob>...I was wandering aimlessly like a stray kitten. A lost soul...<sniff>...
14381 : Nyaaaaaah...
14382 : What will you do!? Who, me? Take evasive measures!
14383 : Ever since we lost Lilisette...
14384 : I've traversed the land, observing the changes that have come to pass. Bearing witness.
14385 : Come with me, %. There's something I need you to see. Show and tell.
14386 : Look yonder...
14387 : Un, deux, troith! I want to thee thothe legth higher! Touching the thkieth!
14388 : Thtop! For the love of the Goddeth, thtop! <Thigh>... Whatever am I thuppothed to do with you?
14389 : Mutht I remind you all of thomething tho bathic ath the three teneth of Troupe Mayakov?
14390 : The grathe of a flight of thwanth!
14391 : The vigor of a thouthand tigerth! Growrrr!
14392 : And latht but thertainly not leatht...
14393 : The charm of he for whom thith danthe troupe ith named!
14394 : Lithen well. With the abthenthe of Porthia, the Moonthade Butterfly, the three of you mutht thtep up to fill her thoeth.
14395 : The audienthe ethpecth naught but the betht from uth, and I do not intend to dithappoint. Ath you are now, however, you will thurely bethmirch our illuthtriouth reputathion!
14396 : F-forgive us, Mister Mayakov. We promise to give our very best.
14397 : That inspirational monologue, I trust you heard. Were paying attention.
14398 : The Moonshade Butterfly is supposed to be Lilisette, not Portia! The daughter, not the mother!
14399 : It's as though the poor girl no longer exists. Has been wiped from reality.
14400 : There can be no doubt as to the cause of this. The reason why.
14401 : It all started that day, when Lilisette was reduced to so many glowing memory orbs and devoured by Atomos. Swallowed whole.
14402 : Who goeth there!?
14403 : !!!
14404 : Getting an eyeful of my girlth, weren't you?[ Undrething them in your thinful mind?/] Don't even think to deny it.
14405 : I than't thuffer trethpatherth, ethpethially not during rehearthal. Gindaff!
14406 : N-no, it's a misunderstanding!
14407 : Look! % here is on your side! A friend!
14408 : You prethume to thay that I, Alekthei Mayakov, danther ekthtraordinaire, would befriend any [cad/tramp] off the thtreet? Utterly abthurd!
14409 : Thow thith dethpicable gawper and [hith/her] odiouth beathtman accomplithe the door!
14410 : M-meow!? What did you call me!?
14411 : Think twithe before you thow your fatheth here again!
14412 : Nyow-ow-owww...
14413 : I hate to say this, %, but even your existence is under threat. In jeopardy.
14414 : The future looks grimmer than ever. Dark clouds gather.
14415 : Look up to the sky, if you would. Tilt back your head.
14416 : The comet grows ever larger. Every second brings it nearer.
14417 : It's only a matter of time before the fair future whence you came is consumed. Forever lost.
14418 : Then all that remains will be a reality of conflict and strife. A world enveloped in darkness.
14419 : Together, you and Lilisette formed the wings of the Goddess.
14420 : But now the Champions of the Dawn are incomplete. Missing a piece.
14421 : Poor, poor Lilisette...
14422 : Is this truly the end? Checkmate? Will we all fade away into nothingness, the will of Altana along with us? The Goddess's wish unfulfilled?
14423 : Is this the end? We can't give up! We...we're done for.
14424 : Nyaaah! You torment me by giving voice to such horrid thoughts! Add grief to misery! <Sniffle, sob>...
14425 : You have the right of it, %. So long as we still exist, we must cling to hope. Keep up the fight.
14426 : Nyehehehe... That the children of Altana have proven so resilient in the face of adversity delights me to no end. Impresses the whiskers off me.
14427 : Now then. Deep in the Northlands the war rages on. The outcome yet undecided.
14428 : I propose we head there and see how the struggle unfolds. Reassess the situation.
14429 : Even though only one Champion of the Dawn remains to Altana, there may yet be a way to set the world to rights. Win back the future.
14430 : From where? The beginning. Met with Cait Sith. Break and enter. Peepin' and stuff. Shown the door.
14431 : Hm? What have we here?
14432 : Halt. Beyond here lies Northern San d'Oria and Chateau d'Oraguille, the residence of His Majesty King Destin.
14433 : Only authorized personnel may enter. If you haven't business here, begone.
14434 : I've brought medicine to give to Fath--I mean, Sir Ragelise.
14435 : Sir Ragelise is in the midst of convalescence. I have strict orders to allow none to disturb his rest.
14436 : B-but this medicine might well cure him of his illness!
14437 : I beg of you, sir! Please allow me to pass!
14438 : Orders are orders. I must ask you to remove--
14439 : What be the source of this commotion? For a moment I thought the pigmen had yet again breached our walls.
14440 : A-apologies, Sir Vestillet. The lass here demands to see Sir Ragelise, and is being most stubborn about it.
14441 : Well, well, if it isn't young Lilisette who so staunchly fought beside us in La Vaule! I had not imagined to have the pleasure again so soon.
14442 : The pleasure is all mine, sir!
14443 : This young lady happens to be a most dear friend of Sir Ragelise.
14444 : He would be all the better for her visit, I promise you. Allow her to pass, I say.
14445 : A-as you will, sir.
14446 : I've been told that Portia, too, has recently arrived to give comfort to our recuperating friend. 'Tis times like this I wish it were I that took the battle wound, hah hah hah! Now, off you go then. 'Twould not do to make the poor man wait.
14447 : You have my gratitude, sir!
14448 : Sir Ragelise!
14449 : Lilisette! Why, you're all flushed! Upon what storm did you ride to come here?
14450 : S-Sir Ragelise! Please drink this!
14451 : And what might this be, pray?
14452 : It's an infusion...one that might heal your affliction.
14453 : Please, sir! You must try it!
14454 : If it please my lady, then I am powerless to do elsewise.
14455 : H-how do you feel? Does the pain ail you still?
14456 : Uhngh...
14457 : Sir Ragelise!
14458 : ...I shall be fine.
14459 : My thanks, Lilisette. The knowledge alone that your thoughts are with me lends me strength. Rest assured, a little scratch such as this shall not bedevil me long.
14460 : ...
14461 : Be not discouraged, now. Together, we'll surely get through this trying time.
14462 : Portia!!!
14463 : Wh-what in the...? A-as I was saying, only those with pertinent documentation may pass.
14464 : That...medicine. Mayhap I can keep it in your stead.
14465 : Sir Ragelise, I fear, will be absent from the chateau for a time.
14466 : Upon his return, however, I shall see that it is delivered to his hands.
14467 : What? Has a girl named Lilisette come seeking induction into our ranks, you ask?
14468 : ...Forgive me, my lady, but I fear exemptions cannot be extended. Not even for the famous Moonshade Butterfly.
14469 : Only those possessed of % are permitted to undertake the initiation. There are no two ways to interpret this.
14470 : Moreover, should something foul befall you in the course of--
14471 : Who do you take me for? Some helpless damsel!?
14472 : I'll have you know that this delicate darling of Troupe Mayakov beat a dragon to a bloody pulp at La Vaule, and then laid waste to the Orcish forces at the Battle of Jeuno!
14473 : If my credentials as a founding member of Future Fabulous alongside % don't satisfy your recruitment criteria by a malm, then I honestly don't know what will!
14474 : ...%?
14475 : That's right! % of the Knights of the Iron Ram, one of your very own!
14476 : Ah, yes, I recall now. Although [his/her] induction into the Iron Rams was unconventional, [he/she] proved [his/her] steel beyond a shadow of doubt.
14477 : ...
14478 : Unconventional? How do you mean?
14479 : You must tell me more of how % joined your ranks.
14480 : Hm? Where was I? Oh, right, a lass named Lilisette.
14481 : I regret to say the name is not familiar to me.
14482 : I should think I'd remember had a child come calling, wishing to play at war.
14483 : I'm afraid the name Lilisette is not familiar to me.
14484 : You've brought the clues we seek, you say? Hmm, how shall I put this...
14485 : While we are grateful for your help, the mystery has long been solved. Now, we must ask you to kindly desist from any further involvement in this matter.
14486 : What? All that work...to no avail.
14487 : Why, be this not the lovely Lilisette of Troupe Mayakov?
14488 : Lost your way in our vast city, mayhap? I should be most glad to provide escort for milady, if it please her.
14489 : ...
14490 : Eyes front!
14491 : <Gulp> C-Captain Rongelouts!
14492 : I absent myself not for a moment, yet what do I return to find but mine own men slavering over a caparisoned filly!?
14493 : Pathetic, the whole sorry lot of you! If you've a yen to babysit children, I shall pack you off to join the Swiftwing Maggots!
14494 : Pathetic, the whole sorry lot of you! If you've a yen to babysit children, we could always do with more eyes to keep surveillance over those pesky maggots!
14495 : A-apologies, Captain! It shan't happen again!
14496 : Hmph...
14497 : Mainchelite! Is it your intent to turn the proud order of Royal Knights into a hive of maggots?
14498 : B-beg pardons, Captain!
14499 : Hey! Who're you calling a maggot!?
14500 : This knight has done no wrong. If you feel the urge to cast blame, know that I came here of my own accord.
14501 : Well, well, don't we have a feisty one here?
14502 : I shall allow that you have kick. For bereft of that, a soft, squirming maggot is useful for naught.
14503 : What!?
14504 : I had credited you for showing backbone at the Battle of Jeuno, but it seems 'twas too high an evaluation for an invertebrate.
14505 : Allow me to hazard a guess. You've come here seeking none other than %, correct?
14506 : ...!
14507 : Th-that's right. % and I form the tag-team duo, Future Fabulous! I've sworn to watch out for [him/her]!
14508 : You'd suggest that one of my battle-hardened soldiers requires the protection of an unweaned brat? The very notion offends me!
14509 : Un...unweaned!? W-well, how appropriate, you fight like a cow!
14510 : If you would prove yourself more than a suckling babe, capable of protecting yourself and others, I counsel you to do so with actions.
14511 : You profess your desire to watch over %, but I say 'tis you who yearns for the security of [his/her] company. That is, unless you mean to say that % cannot be trusted to walk on [his/her] own two feet?
14512 : ...!
14513 : Hmph! I've had a bellyful of your contempt! % happens to be hard as nails as you say, but I most certainly am no babe at the breast!
14514 : Future Fabulous fights to protect the very future of the world--hardly a task for namby-pambies!
14515 : Hah. At the very least, it appears you lack not for conviction. You are free to do as you will. Know, though, that I shan't suffer your overwrought behavior upsetting my soldiers' morale.
14516 : What? You seek the red-haired girl? Who do you take me for? The keeper of maggots!?
14517 : Should you find her, though, you'd do well to see her back to where she belongs. We've enough maggots squirming hereabouts as it is.
14518 : Ah, %! Gorgeouth to lay eyeth!
14519 : Word of your valorouth exploith at the Valdeaunian Front hath been rethounding all over Than d'Oria!
14520 : Everyone thpeakth with high praithe of the cruthial role you played in thecuring a foothold in the thtruggle.
14521 : To think that it wath I who thaw your potenthial from the very thtart! My uncanny thenthe of perthepthion never failth me, I tell you! Ohohoho!
14522 : With your invaluable thervithe, our northern fortheth were able to regroup. They're preparing for the final offenthive ath we thpeak! Oh gloriouth day!
14523 : Hm? Ith thomething amith? You don't theem to be deriving any pleathure from the happy tidingth...
14524 : Talk with Mayakov about... Lilisette. Ragelise.
14525 : Talk with Mayakov about... Lilisette.
14526 : Talk with Mayakov about... Ragelise.
14527 : Lilithette? That'th no name thith danther hath ever heard.
14528 : Your truthty partner who fought bethide you throughout the war, you thay?
14529 : Oh, come now, %. We both know you're modetht to a fault, and thith ith doubtleth thome ploy to catht attenthion away from yourthelf. Thethe earth of mine hear many a rumor, but they all thpeak of you ath a dauntleth lone wolf! Aroo-aroooooo!
14530 : Marvelouth newth! Thir Ragelithe hath been reinthtated to the Royal Knighth! Numerouth perthonth of influenthe thent petithionth to the Allied headquarterth, you thee, and hith dithmithal wath thubthequently overturned.
14531 : What'th more, it'th looking ever more likely that the Knighth of the Ironcrest Hawk will be reinthtituted under hith command.
14532 : Truth be told, that Thir Ragelithe appearth to have lotht all recollecthion of hith time in Valdeaunia did give me pauthe. But theeing him back otherwithe hale and hearty ith more than anyone can athk for.
14533 : Now, hold on to your proverbial hat, for here cometh the biggetht, motht exthilarating newth to crown them all!
14534 : It pleatheth me to no end to tell you that a wedding date hath been thet! Huthah!
14535 : Whothe wedding, you athk? Why, who elthe but our very own dream couple, Thir Ragelithe and Porthia!
14536 : With authpithiouth eventh taking plathe both on and off the battlefield, the prevailing mood in the Allied Fortheth hath become one of optimithm.
14537 : <Thigh>... It feelth like forever thinthe we've had occathion to thelebrate.
14538 : Thith here ith an offithial invitation with your name on it.
14539 : Knowing your incurable propenthity for wanderlutht, Thir Ragelithe entruthted it to my thafe keeping.
14540 : The theremony will be held at the Temple of the Goddeth in Jeuno. I thall make my way there prethently. Thee to it that you thow up in a timely fathion!
14541 : The gathered dawndrops unleash a brilliant light, melding together to form %!
14542 : You have retraced all junctions of eventualities. Hasten back to where Cait Sith and Lilisette await.
14543 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
14544 : Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.
14545 : Those who possess % may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused. Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.
14546 : Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
14547 : I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
14548 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Have stratum abyssite examined. Request teleportation. Analyze atmacite. Ask about atmacite. Ask about atmacite enrichment.
14549 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.
14550 : Infuse which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) Previous page. Next page.
14551 : Infusing the % (lv.#) requires # cruor.
14552 : Infuse % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
14553 : You do not have enough cruor.
14554 : [Infuse/Purge] which atmacite? None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#)
14555 : Purge % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
14556 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with % (lv.#)!
14557 : The atmacite could not be infused...
14558 : % has been purged of the % (lv.#).
14559 : % purges the % (lv.#), infusing % (lv.#) in its place. (Cruor expended: #)
14560 : You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.
14561 : Enrich which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # Previous page. Next page.
14562 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
14563 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
14564 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
14565 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
14566 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
14567 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
14568 : The atmacite could not be purged...
14569 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
14570 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
14571 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
14572 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
14573 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
14574 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
14575 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
14576 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
14577 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
14578 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
14579 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
14580 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
14581 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
14582 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
14583 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
14584 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
14585 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
14586 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
14587 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
14588 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
14589 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
14590 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
14591 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
14592 : Your % has evolved into %!
14593 : Supply me with the # cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.

15328 : I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the [Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana]. My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.
15329 : I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.
15330 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Ask a bunch of questions. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
15331 : While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess % may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
15332 : The % is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.
15333 : Enlisted in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s armed forces, you say? Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.
15334 : I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
15335 : While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel. Come back again once you have proven your worth.
15336 : You must be at least level # to participate in Voidwatch.
15337 : Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!
15338 : I see you've yet to be issued %. Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.
15339 : Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.
15340 : You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or jurisdiction.
15341 : Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.
15342 : While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with %.
15343 : Operations are presently underway at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
15344 : Operations are presently underway at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
15345 : Operations are presently underway at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
15346 : It would seem some other requirement exists besides the usual % and %.
15347 : Rest assured, you will be apprised of this information as soon as we acquire it.
15348 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].
15349 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg].
15350 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo].
15351 : When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension. The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.
15352 : Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!
15353 : Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.
15354 : The % you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.
15355 : You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
15356 : Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts. This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.
15357 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
15358 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
15359 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
15360 : Operations are currently underway [in the greater Jeuno region/in the three nations]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
15361 : Ah, I daresay your % has undergone change!
15362 : How many would you like? None. Just one. Fill me up!
15363 : Here is your additional % allocation. Make each and every one count, you hear?
15364 : It appears you already possess the maximum allocation of # stones. I'm not authorized to provision you with more.
15365 : I'm afraid we're out of stock. The next shipment is expected to arrive in # [minute/minutes] (Earth time).
15366 : Obtained key item: # %!
15367 : Obtained key item: # %!
15368 : Your outstanding allocation of %? My records tell me you have # to your name.
15369 : Exchange for what? (Cruor: #) Nothing right now. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #.
15370 : # cruor is required for %.
15371 : # cruor is required for the %.
15372 : Proceed? (Required Cruor: #) Yes. No.
15373 : It seems you do not have enough cruor.
15374 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for %!
15375 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for the %!
15376 : Hm? It seems you already possess %. In that case, you won't be needing another.
15377 : This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.
15378 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.
15379 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.
15380 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.
15381 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.
15382 : A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.
15383 : A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.
15384 : A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
15385 : What will you ask about? Nothing. The Voidwalker threat. How I can do my part. The Voidwatch. Voidwatchers. Ascent items. Riftworn pyxides. %. Stratum abyssite. Planar rifts. Cruor. Abyssite. Voidstone consumption.
15386 : Voidwalker is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.
15387 : Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.
15388 : While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.
15389 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.
15390 : As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.
15391 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.
15392 : To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.
15393 : Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.
15394 : Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.
15395 : Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought. Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.
15396 : These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team. They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.
15397 : Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.
15398 : The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to # stones per person at any given time.
15399 : That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.
15400 : The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call Voidwalkers.
15401 : Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.
15402 : Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.
15403 : Possession of % is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
15404 : It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.
15405 : You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.
15406 : Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
15407 : In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.
15408 : The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.
15409 : When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.
15410 : Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.
15411 : However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.
15412 : Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.
15413 : Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.
15414 : But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the existential spectrum.
15415 : You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned. In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.
15416 : The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.
15417 : To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.
15418 : Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
15419 : Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.
15420 : One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items, while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.
15421 : Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.
15422 : All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.
15423 : Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.
15424 : For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.
15425 : In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.
15426 : Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.
15427 : If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.
15428 : Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company. It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.
15429 : Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.
15430 : Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.
15431 : Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.
15432 : % and % are representative of such items. They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.
15433 : (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)
15434 : They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.
15435 : Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.
15436 : Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.
15437 : Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.
15438 : Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding. But I digress...
15439 : Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.
15440 : As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch. Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.
15441 : It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.
15442 : Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong. Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.
15443 : Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.
15444 : The % is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.
15445 : Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.
15446 : The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.
15447 : I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.
15448 : I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.
15449 : Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?
15450 : Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.
15451 : Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them. Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!
15452 : And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.
15453 : I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really. Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.
15454 : As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray. Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...
15455 : Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.
15456 : Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing. There exists another: stratum abyssite.
15457 : Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite. Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.
15458 : Are you familiar with voiddust? Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.
15459 : As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch. Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.
15460 : The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust. Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me? Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.
15461 : At any rate, should you manage to obtain any voiddust in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me. Simple enough, wouldn't you say?
15462 : Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
15463 : Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.
15464 : If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.
15465 : Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land. The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
15466 : By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension.
15467 : Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.
15468 : Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.
15469 : Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.
15470 : Keep this fact in mind at all times.
15471 : It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.
15472 : If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...
15473 : Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
15474 : While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.
15475 : As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants. There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.
15476 : Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.
15477 : Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite. If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.
15478 : As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.
15479 : Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.
15480 : Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called periapt--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
15481 : Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.
15482 : Select where voidstones will be consumed from.
15483 : Set to which? Key items. Stock.
15484 : Voidstones will now be taken from [your key items/the stock].
15485 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here is your voidstone! Take it and use it well.
15486 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here are your voidstones! Take them and use them well.
15487 : It seems you already possess as many voidstones as you can carry. You'll want to hold on to that voiddust until you've depleted your supply.
15488 : How many do you need? (Cruor: #) None, thank you. One (# cruor). Three (# cruor). Six (# cruor). Nine (# cruor). Twelve (# cruor).
15489 : % obtains one % in exchange for # cruor.
15490 : % obtains # % in exchange for # cruor.

15499 : At attention, soldier! I've received an urgent alarum calling our best men to arms, and guess whose name is listed front and center? You're to report to Jeuno for further orders immediately.
15500 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me. Pick up those legs and get a move on!
15501 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me.
15502 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate in Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through.
15503 : Time is short, so pick up those legs and get a move on, soldier!
15504 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate just over there and one of our men will see you through.
15505 : Excellent work, %. You serve the Voidwatch well. Your presence has been requested in the Grand Duchy once more. Make your way there with all speed.
15506 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace.
15507 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
15508 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate at Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.

15511 : Where's your %, soldier? I'll need to see one before I can authorize your participation in the [Jeuno/Qufim] Voidwatch jurisdiction.
15512 : % are issued only to those brave men and women who have distinguished themselves in regional Voidwatch efforts.
15513 : Prove yourself capable in the three nations, and you can rest assured that your abilities won't go overlooked. Keep fighting the good fight, soldier!
15514 : Reporting for combat, are you? Yes, this % of yours appears to be in order. Welcome aboard!
15515 : I suspect you've already been briefed about the use of %, but protocol dictates that I ask if you are in need of a review. What will it be, soldier?
15516 : What will it be, soldier? Ready for battle, sir! I need a briefing, sir!
15517 : Now that's what I like to hear, soldier!

15535 : Hold it right there, soldier! A summons just came in from the Grand Duchy, and it's got your name on it. The envoy said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you get moving.
15536 : We've been looking for you, soldier. I've got a summons from the Grand Duchy here, and just look at the name on it: %. Our messenger said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you ready yourself and depart immediately.

My wares can be yours, provided you've got [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes] to trade.

15559 : How many? ( [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes]: #)
15560 : You may purchase up to # at a time.
15561 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
15562 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
15563 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
15564 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
15565 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
15566 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
15567 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
15568 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
15569 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
15570 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
15571 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
15572 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
15573 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
15574 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
15575 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
15576 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
15577 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
15578 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
15579 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
15580 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
15581 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
15582 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
15583 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
15584 : Deal, kupo? (Current gil: #). Check storable items. Deal. No deal.

15597 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
15598 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
15599 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
15600 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
15601 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.

15619 : The merchant who sold 'em to me claimed that you can use 'em to call people to help you in battle. Bah. What fool'd believe in that hocus-pocus?
15620 : You tryin' to cheat me? That's not nearly enough notes!
15621 : Hm? Pray tell, what is that curious % you bear?
15622 : 'Tis good to see your face, %. We remain ever concerned about Excenmille, and can only pray that he is safe.
15623 : 'Tis good to see your face, %. We have been waiting for a missive from our former captain, Excenmille. Have you heard aught?
15624 : I see. So then we are both equally in the dark. I can only hope that naught has befallen him in Rhazowa.
15625 : It would be wholly unlike him to be bested with ease.
15626 : You are right, of course. Ever true the old phrase, No news is good news.
15627 : Truth be told, my worries lie with Captain Rahal.
15628 : %, perchance you have stumbled upon him? As captain of the Swiftwing Griffins, his days are long and his nights yet longer.
15629 : He leads new recruits onto the field of battle nearly each day, aiming to inspire them by vanquishing what remains of the Orcs.
15630 : Regardless of the glory, honor, and fame he earns for himself, he aspires to become more.
15631 : We beg him to repose, to let others handle this task, yet he refuses to listen to us. You, on the other hand...
15632 : It comes as no surprise that Rahal would take nary a moment to rest.
15633 : Excenmille!?
15634 : Is that truly you!?
15635 : Bistillot, Rholont. And %. I trust the three of you fare well and continue to grow each day.
15636 : And you, too, have shot up in height-- But what on Vana'diel has brought you back?
15637 : The struggle against the Orcs is ceaseless, but our efforts have finally borne fruit. We succeeded in toppling one of their main fortresses.
15638 : I was tasked with delivering a report to His Majesty, as well as cobbling together a regiment of fresh reinforcements.
15639 : Jayramus remains ever the bother, so freeing myself from his shackles was somewhat of a boon. I would, however, be weaving an untruth were I to say that my trek across the Uleguerand Range was so simple.
15640 : But seeing you all has lightened my heart and given wings to my spirit.
15641 : Your words are far too kind!
15642 : And news of your victory pleases us further still. Striking at the heart of the enemy and drawing blood bodes well for us--I only hope that it buys us some measure of respite.
15643 : We left men of the highest caliber to secure the front, but I am afraid we cannot rest on our laurels. A counterattack is surely on the horizon.
15644 : But enough tales of victory. You say that Rahal is causing you some consternation?
15645 : Far be it from him to listen to me, or to any of our elders, but I realize now that we cannot be tethered to what we once were.
15646 : Would you not agree, %?
15647 : We become strong to protect what we hold dear, yet with each passing moment our responsibilities grow in number. This is a sign of maturity.
15648 : Excenmille!?
15649 : Wha--!?
15650 : What is the meaning of this!?
15651 : Tell me, %!
15652 : I am your alter ego, Excenmille. Something similar to you, but not wholly the same, representing who you are before you are fully an adult.
15653 : But how is such a thing--!?
15654 : I-is this some form of new magic? Never in my few years have I heard of such...
15655 : Wait! This presents an opportunity most golden.
15656 : Could Excenmille's...alter ego...talk some sense into Rahal?
15657 : Rholont, your perspicacity when facing the unknown has taken me by pleasant surprise.
15658 : Excenmille, your approval means more than I could possibly express!
15659 : Men, word has reached me that Excenmille...
15660 : ...has...
15661 : B-by the Goddess, there are two of them!
15662 : My eyes...deceive me not. I had wondered if I had been beset by vertigo.
15663 : Perhaps...perhaps I should take a rest.
15664 : Captain!?
15665 : Rahal!?
15666 : This has certainly taken a turn for the unexpected...yet somehow, all is well in the end.

15733 : Hmmm... Then I have a stranger question: have you been having any odd dreams lately?
15734 : %...
15735 : A first reunion was surprising enough, but a second!
15736 : This isn't going to be a happy one either, is it? What happened?
15737 : Cait Sith was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and I couldn't pluck the answers off her.
15738 : All I know is that it's got to be related to those dreams I've been having. You've seen them too, haven't you?
15739 : Is this another one of my dreams?
15740 : I've seen all manner of disturbing dreams lately. Perhaps because of Lilith's dark future...
15741 : You've seen similar ones too, haven't you?
15742 : Have you had odd dreams? Not dreams, but visions... Not really.
15743 : I knew I couldn't have been the only one!
15744 : They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.
15745 : Are you quite sure?
15746 : They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.
15747 : I wanted to reach out to them, but instead of grasping their hands I began to float upward, my form bound by light.
15748 : I became one with that selfsame light...and the last thing I saw was your face.
15749 : Your visage was even more noble than usual, and you had become...a god.
15750 : Huh? You had a different dream?
15751 : Wh-what!? That's an ill omen if I ever heard one!
15752 : Could such terror truly be what the world has in store for us?
15753 : Then in my dreams...all that light... Was it just a fraud, and I'm totally powerless!?
15754 : What kind of trickery is this!?
15755 : How do you respond? I'll think of something. I need your help. ...
15756 : Oh, I see how it is. You're going to run off and save the world!
15757 : Hehe! I knew I should have had more confidence in you!
15758 : And so...do you have a plan to meet with Altana?
15759 : You say Cait Sith was on about meeting Altana being our only chance. But I wonder...
15760 : Maybe we'll be able to think of something if we put our heads together.
15761 : %, you're really something else.
15762 : You're right. Maybe we can come up with something if we put our heads together.
15763 : I'm not sure exactly how to go about it, though.
15764 : Cait Sith said that our best bet may lie in meeting with Altana?
15765 : Even if we are the wings of the Goddess, that doesn't mean we have all the answers.
15766 : We might have to rack our brains for this one...
15767 : S-sorry for stepping out of line.
15768 : I might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but that doesn't mean I can't try my best to come up with something.
15769 : After all, it's up to us to protect both the future and the past--and I hope you'd expect nothing less of me!
15770 : So...Cait Sith said that meeting Altana might be our only shot?
15771 : We might be the Goddess's wings, but...well, nothing pops right to mind.
15772 : Maybe we'll find a solution if we put our heads together.
15773 : Oh? What is...
15774 : Goodness! By the stars, what just happened!?
15775 : That was no dream, right? Or was it? I...I saw the future!
15776 : Nothing super far away, mind you, but something close that the two of us can bring about together!
15777 : %, not only did I see the future, but also the past. Memories of the times we spent together, both warm and cold. A phantasmagoric kaleidoscope of images.
15778 : You're...absolutely sure I'm not dead? Hehehe!
15779 : Something awful's happened! Not good at all!
15780 : If it isn't that odd kitty cat!
15781 : Cait Sith...? What's wrong?
15782 : %, it's about that ambassador friend of yours. The person you've been looking for.
15783 : He found his way [here/to the Walk of Echoes]!
15784 : The Walk of Echoes?
15785 : Oh dear. Here. I'll let % explain the rest. Fill you in on the particulars.
15786 : I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!
15787 : How terrible must this foe be if he's managed to make his way [to this world/to the Walk of Echoes]?
15788 : %, I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!
15789 : Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!
15790 : Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!
15791 : That orb you carry...the light erased all my doubts and fears. I'm ready for whatever may come to pass.
15792 : Together we have the strength to conquer the darkness!
15793 : I'll be waiting for you in the Walk of Echoes.
15794 : And this Walk of Echoes...we can get there from a cavernous maw?
15795 : Got it! I'll meet you there!
15796 : There appears to be discord within the Confederate forces. Or perhaps they are simply trying to trick us into thinking so...
15797 : Ah, you are % from the [Knights of the Iron Ram/Fourth Division/Cobra Unit], yes?
15798 : I could never forget a capable new recruit such as yourself.
15799 : I am Valaineral, captain of the Royal Guards. I need your help with a mission of the utmost importance.
15800 : Accept Valaineral's request? Of course. Sorry, I'm busy.
15801 : I see... I guess it cannot be helped. I must think of another way.
15802 : The battle situation is changing constantly, and we may be left with no hope of reprieve...
15803 : Please, allow me to explain. We received a report from the Knights of the Madder Falcon in Valdeaunia the other day that cannot be overlooked.
15804 : We are currently at war with the Beastman Confederate as they ramp up their forces, and they are now preparing some kind of magical weapon to use in the fight.
15805 : Apparently, this weapon is known as the World Eater Egg. Just as its name suggests, it reportedly has the power to devour the world itself.
15806 : However, aside from its name, everything about this egg is shrouded in total mystery.
15807 : As such, we know next to nothing about its actual use, current location, or origin. There is no mention about such an object in any known legend, meaning that we are completely in the dark about it.
15808 : Just as we were planning to interrogate a beastman we captured, we were approached by someone who had inside information.
15809 : According to this defector, the World Eater Egg is an extremely dangerous object, one that not even the Confederate forces are capable of handling properly.
15810 : This defector then asked us to put a stop to the beastmen's plan, so we suspected it was some kind of trap at first.
15811 : We thought that because the defector said the egg was located deep within the Eldieme Necropolis.
15812 : Do you know about the Eldieme Necropolis?
15813 : It is part of the Coveffe Barrows, and was built by the Elvaan civilization long ago.
15814 : I have heard that it serves as a burial ground for the countless knights that have fallen in battle over the years under the kingdom's banner.
15815 : I spoke with both the grave keeper and also a gravedigger at the site and they mentioned that some sort of egg had been excavated there.
15816 : Since it is of unknown origin, it was determined that it was too dangerous to move. Therefore, it still remains deep within the Necropolis.
15817 : Naturally, there is not enough information to say with certainty that this is the World Eater Egg that everyone is talking about.
15818 : However, we recently received word that the Confederate forces' elite troops have infiltrated Batallia Downs.
15819 : If that is true, we had to assume that they were after this World Eater Egg as well.
15820 : Once we made that determination, our mobile unit known as the Knights of the Red Rose immediately set out for the Eldieme Necropolis.
15821 : Unfortunately, they were ambushed by an enemy unit lurking in the area and their advance is currently at a standstill.
15822 : That is why we need your help. You must reach the World Eater Egg before the Confederate forces do!
15823 : I want you to keep an eye on the World Eater Egg until Noillurie and her knights can get there.
15824 : Inquire about what? Who is Noillurie? I just need to watch it? Where will you be?
15825 : She is the leader of the Knights of the Red Rose. Having studied the art of bushido in the Far East, she wears somewhat unusual armor.
15826 : The weapon she carries at her waist is also quite special. There is no mistaking her once you see her.
15827 : It may be necessary for us to destroy this World Eater Egg before it can cause any harm.
15828 : If possible though, we would like to find out its true origin and purpose, but I am leaving that decision to Noillurie and her knights.
15829 : I must remain here and follow the movements of the Confederate forces so that we can keep abreast of the battle situation.
15830 : At the moment, I am also awaiting new information relating to this World Eater Egg.
15831 : The source of this information is a mercenary known as Duskraven. We know next to nothing about this man, so we still have much to learn...
15832 : Now then, this is no time for idle conversation. You must make preparations for your journey at once.
15833 : In order to reach your destination, you will need to enter the Eldieme Necropolis from a barrow that lies in the center of Batallia Downs.
15834 : There is a strong possibility that you will encounter the Confederate unit. I recommend that you proceed with caution.
15835 : You must find this World Eater Egg that the Confederate forces are after as quickly as possible. Please watch over it until the Knights of the Red Rose arrive.
15836 : In order to reach your destination, you will need to enter the Eldieme Necropolis from a barrow that lies in the center of Batallia Downs.
15837 : There is a strong possibility that you will encounter the Confederate unit. I recommend that you proceed with caution.
15838 : What!? The Confederate unit is heading for the World Eater Egg!?
15839 : You must protect the egg until the Knights of the Red Rose arrive!
15840 : It is good to see you.
15841 : I received a report from Noillurie of the Knights of the Red Rose. I heard that you drove off the Confederate unit.
15842 : However, you failed to secure the World Eater Egg as requested. Tell me what happened.
15843 : If we can believe what that demon Delkfutt said, the egg is not meant to be used as a weapon.
15844 : Although, we have no reason to trust him. If we are not careful, it could lead us to ruin.
15845 : I am having our agents continue to track the whereabouts of the World Eater Egg.
15846 : Also, we need to investigate the egg's origin. In order to do so, we will have to journey to a country far beyond the sea.
15847 : In fact, I received some very useful information during your mission. The source was the mercenary known as Duskraven.
15848 : According to him, the Sacred City of Adoulin had books on the World Eater Eggs.
15849 : I would like to check them out, but we are already stretched to the limit. I cannot afford to send anybody out on such a long journey at the moment.
15850 : For the time being, I asked Troupe Mayakov if it could seek out the necessary intelligence on our behalf. However, it was not very realistic of me.
15851 : As such, I suppose I will need to go investigate the matter myself. Perhaps I shall go after the allied forces have seized victory.
15852 : With the Kingdom of San d'Oria welcoming peace, my existence only serves to spark conflict, not the good of the people...
15853 : Now then, I shall relieve you of your responsibilities.
15854 : You may leave the rest to us. Go forth and devote yourself to a new mission from the [Knights of the Iron Ram/Fourth Division/Cobra Unit] to serve the Forces of Altana.
15855 : Although it is not much, I have prepared a small reward for your efforts.
15856 : This weapon is something that fans of Troupe Mayakov desperately want.
15857 : Actually, maybe it is not a weapon, but rather a projectile or maybe even some kind of musical instrument? At any rate, waving it about is sure to draw attention.
15858 : It is rather pointless for me to be in the spotlight, so I would like for you to have it. Please take good care of it.
15859 : Wait. You forgot your reward. Be careful out there!
15860 : Your report has revealed new information about the World Eater Egg. I must examine every last detail until we can get to the bottom of the matter.
15861 : I have no intention of believing the words of a demon, but there is a deeper meaning behind its mention of Valhalla and Odin.
15862 : I have come up with a way to enlist the help of a theologian from the church. You can leave the rest to us.
