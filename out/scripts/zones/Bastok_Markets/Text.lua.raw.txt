6809 : I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!

6811 : Press it and the Mog House menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
6812 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
6813 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
6814 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
6815 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
6816 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
6817 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
6818 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
6819 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!

6824 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!

6843 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?

6845 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
6846 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
6847 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
6848 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!

6870 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.

6894 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
6895 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...

6908 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
6909 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
6910 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
6911 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
6912 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
6913 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
6914 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
6915 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
6916 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
6917 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
6918 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
6919 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
6920 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
6921 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
6922 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...
6923 : Do something? Read instructions. Change parameters. Teleport to key locations. Warp to home point. Receive items. Obtain 100,000,000 gil. Do nothing.
6924 : Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
6925 : But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!

6998 : Use the Map in the main menu for a more detailed view of your surroundings.

7039 : You may teleport between these crystalline nodes called home points for efficient travel. Be sure to examine any you stumble upon.
7040 : There's some special crystal nodes known as home points that'll undoubtedly serve you well. Don't forget to interact with all that you find, as they can help you get to far away places.

7098 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. I have been appointed by the Guildworkers' Union to manage the trading of manufactured crafts and the exchange of guild points.
7099 : However, to assure product quality, I cannot carry out any business with those who rank lower than novice.
7100 : I see that you currently have a trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild. I'm sorry, but I cannot do any business with you.
7101 : You do have the option to terminate your contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and form one with us.
7102 : After signing a new contract, you will have to wait until the next delivery phase to trade Guildworkers' Union requested items.
7103 : Create a new contract with us? Immediately. Not today.
7104 : Are you certain? I said, Immediately. On second thought...
7105 : You have terminated your trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7106 : Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.
7107 : If you happen to create a high quality version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.
7108 : Trading us these items will earn you guild points which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.
7109 : The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.
7110 : When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.
7111 : I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.
7112 : If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.
7113 : You have formed a new trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.

7115 : Currently, no items are being requested by the guild. You have # guild points accumulated.
7116 : Is there something you need? I'm just passing through. I would like to use my points. What are the current limits? How does the trade system work?
7117 : You have # more days (Vana'diel time) to provide us with the requested item.
7118 : Today (Vana'diel time) is the final day we will accept the requested item.
7119 : You can still receive up to # guild points by trading us the item before the time limit is up.
7120 : You are not eligible to receive guild points at this time.

This procedure cannot be undone, so please consider your decision carefully.
7141 : Renounce your rank as a [Carpenter/Blacksmith/Goldsmith/Weaver/Tanner/Boneworker/Alchemist/Culinarian]? No, retain. Yes, renounce.
7142 : You have successfully renounced your status as a [craftsman/artisan/adept] of the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7143 : Ah, welcome, young [man/lady], to the Goldsmiths' Guild. This is a special association for those who work with silver, gold, gems, and all precious materials.
7144 : If you have no interest in joining our selected few, then off with you. There are no guided tours here.
7145 : Wonderful... You are one of those...what do they call them...adventurers, are you not? I think we shall start you off with crystal synthesis.
7146 : I'm sure you already know, but crystals are a form of condensed energy. Using crystal synthesis draws the energy from the crystals, and uses that energy to convert matter into different forms.
7147 : It sounds simple, but true works of art can only be made by forming an image of the item when you synthesize. The better the image, the better chances you have of getting a product worth keeping.
7148 : That's why professional goldsmiths such as myself can produce superior goods...but don't take it personally.
7149 : Our guild does not prefer crystal synthesis to traditional methods, but if you ask the others here, I'm sure they will give you some good advice. They are all top-class artisans.
7150 : The long history of goldsmithing tells the never-ending tale of man's pursuit for beauty. That history will continue as long as gold glitters. So, take your time, and start slowly.
7151 : Do you remember your first accessory? Do you remember the person who wore it? No matter how skilled a goldsmith you become, you must never forget how you felt at that moment.
7152 : It looks as if you are ready to take the next step in your goldsmithing career. Try your hand at %.
7153 : Succeed, and I shall grace you with another gem of knowledge.
7154 : Ah, this is a fair example of craftsmanship. [Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice] is the title you may wear. And remember...take your time. There is no need to rush things.
7155 : Ah, this is a fine example of craftsmanship.
7156 : Ah, this is an excellent example of craftsmanship.
7157 : This... This is a fabulous example of craftsmanship... No, a fabulous work of art! You have more than earned the title of adept. There is little more I can teach you.
7158 : This is so beautiful! I think I will be asking you to make all of my jewelry from now on!
7159 : Hey! Watch it! Do you want me to like, miss a flaw?
7160 : Come on! I just helped you out!
7161 : Are you like, trying to rip me off or something? I'm a respected goldsmith, you know.
7162 : Okay, I'll help you out. Shut your eyes...
7163 : Why don't you, like, make %? You're gonna need these, though...
7164 : And that's it! If you don't think you've got what it takes, I'd be happy to help you out...for a price, of course.
7165 : Nope... Can't stop to chat with you right now.
7166 : Hey, don't you remember someone helping you five seconds ago?
7167 : Not enough, [mister/lady]. Sorry, but I don't work for free.
7168 : Okay. Eyes closed, now.
7169 : You? You'd be best off trying your luck with %. Get your notepad ready...
7170 : That's all. Collecting materials yourself is a cheap way to practice your goldsmithing...unless you've got gil to burn.
7171 : If you have any business with me, receive permission from the guildmaster before returning.
7172 : I can be of no service to you now.
7173 : I understand that your funds may be limited, but we have certain rules and restrictions we must abide by.
7174 : Concentrate... Concentrate....
7175 : ... Why not try %? You will require...
7176 : ...and nothing more.
7177 : I see you have matured into a fine goldsmith. Perhaps it is time you entered the leagues of the greats. Try your hand at %.
7178 : If you are able to complete this task, you will be worthy of the title of craftsman.
7179 : However, you must realize that with the title of craftsman comes certain responsibilities. More will be asked of you.
7180 : I do not mind you becoming a craftsman of another guild, but remember that your status among other goldsmiths may fall...
7181 : I must commend you on your exquisite work and hereby grant you the title of craftsman.
7182 : Feel free to become a craftsman of another guild, but do not forget that it may be difficult to maintain your level of goldsmith skills.
7183 : Such ingenuity, such inventiveness! I commend you on your efforts and hereby grant you the title of craftsman. Continue to polish your skills and your bracelets and bijoux will shine even brighter!
7184 : % is a wonderful new method of goldsmithing that allows you to enchant precious metals with the mysterious energy of black magic and anima.
7185 : % is a wonderful new method of goldsmithing that allows you to enchant precious metals with the mysterious energy of white magic and anima.
7186 : I see you have become a registered craftsman in another guild--and this after I warned you that your goldsmithing skills would go down if you did.
7187 : %, you are an elite goldsmith. I know few who can match your talent. And that is why I want you to concentrate on your work for this guild.
7188 : Will you consider revoking your craftsman status in all other guilds? If you like, I can contact the other guildmasters and tell them of your decision.
7189 : Revoke all other craftsman statuses? Yes. No.
7190 : A wise decision, %. I look forward to your further development in the field of goldsmithing.
7191 : I see... And I thought that you had your sights set a little higher...
7192 : Hmm, the synthesis items for that rank are still beyond your skill, I'm afraid.
7193 : % is a wonderful new method of goldsmithing that allows you to shape softened ingots with a mandrel, making it easier to process more chains with one crystal.
7194 : % is a wonderful new method of goldsmithing that allows you to shape softened ingots on a workshop anvil, making it easier to process more sheets with one crystal.
7195 : % is a wonderful new method of goldsmithing that allows you to craft mechanical parts based on the same techniques used to build timepieces.
7196 : Let's see now... This shaft's connected to...this gear. This gear's connected to my...belt buckle? Could you, like, not talk to me right now?
7197 : We're really busy researching the application of our cutting-edge clockmaking techniques in the field of automaton augmentation. Whoa, I sound really professional, don't I?
7198 : Well, if it isn't our very own [veteran/expert/authority/luminary/master]. Quite some time has passed since you achieved your current rank. Are you perhaps ready to strive for greater heights?
7199 : Strive for greater heights? Certainly! Maybe later...
7200 : Excellent! That's just the answer I was hoping to hear from our rising star. First, you'll want to speak to Ellard and obtain yourself %.
7201 : Some guild points will be required for the transaction, but that should prove no obstacle for your considerable talents and devotion.
7202 : A shame that you would allow your potential to go to waste. But I will hold no grudges. Should you ever have a change of heart, simply say the word.
7203 : First, you'll want to speak to Ellard and obtain a copy of %.
7204 : Ah, you've returned. And that look of confidence on your face tells me you've already grasped the contents of %.
7205 : Very well, then. Your task is to craft %. Now I'll only say this once, so I encourage you to take notes. The ingredients you will need are...
7206 : Finally, you'll want to remember to sign your masterwork. This is not merely a guild regulation, but also speaks to the pride that a goldsmith takes in [his/her] work.
7207 : <Sigh>... I thought I told you to take notes. I am loath to repeat myself, but will make an exception this once. The ingredients for % are...
7208 : Splendid! Marvelous! Spectacular! I am blinded with the brilliance of your craftsmanship. I hereby bestow upon you the rank of expert. Wear it with pride!
7209 : An admirable attempt, yet it lacks a certain...something. Ah, a signature! Do you so lack confidence in your work that you are unwilling to put your name to it?
7210 : Needless to say, this won't do at all. Back to the studio with you, and do try to follow instructions this time.
7211 : I see you have matured into a fine goldsmith. Perhaps it is time you entered the leagues of the greats. Try your hand at %.
7212 : If you are able to complete this task, you will be worthy of the title of [artisan/adept/veteran].
7213 : However, you must realize that with the title of [artisan/adept/veteran] come certain responsibilities. More will be asked of you.
7214 : I do not mind you becoming [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in another guild, but remember that your status among other goldsmiths may fall...
7215 : While I cannot prevent you from striving for [artisan/adept/veteran] status in another guild, bear in mind that you may find it difficult to maintain your high level of goldsmithing proficiency if you do.
7216 : %. Is it true that you've been recognized as [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] at a guild other than our own?
7217 : I must say, I struggle to understand this decision. To put it bluntly, you do both yourself and those who would appreciate your work a disservice by not devoting your efforts to your one true calling.
7218 : Fortunately, it is not too late to reconsider. What would you say to giving up your [artisan/adept/veteran] status elsewhere?
7219 : It is a simple enough process--I can even inform other guildmasters of your decision to save you the trouble.
7220 : %. I see that you are still spreading your talents thin. Do you not remember the conversation we had about focusing on your one true calling?
7221 : <Sigh>... But I have said enough. Dabble in lesser crafts as you see fit--it is of no concern to me!
7222 : You can't fish here.
7223 : You can't fish without a rod in your hands.
7224 : You can't fish without bait on the hook.

7322 : I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...
7323 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
7324 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
7325 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7326 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7327 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7328 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7329 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7330 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7331 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7332 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7333 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7334 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7335 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7336 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7337 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7338 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7339 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7340 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7341 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7342 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7343 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7344 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7345 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7346 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7347 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7348 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
7349 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
7350 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
7351 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.

7373 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7374 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7375 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7383 : Hey, you! I'll have you know that only the rightful leader of the Star Onion Brigade can sit there! Get down right now before I charge you with trees-on and disturbing the peas!
7384 : I don't know how you got inside, but that area is off limits. Vacate the premises immediately!
7385 : He...he...here's your delivery...<wheeze>...!
7386 : Thanks once again. Light on your feet today, I see!
7387 : Walking trees!? How positively...peculiar. Are these also creations conjured up with Tarutaru magic?
7388 : In the Gustaberg Mountains of Southern Quon lies the industrial nation known as the Republic of Bastok.
7389 : Compared to San d'Oria, with its legendary orders of knights, or Windurst, with its ancient institutes of magic, Bastok is still but a newborn nation.
7390 : But advanced technology and near limitless underground resources have allowed Bastok to rival the other two nations in power.
7391 : Innovative and adaptable Humes make up more than half the population of Bastok.
7392 : With their flair for industry, economy, and politics, they were the driving force behind Bastok's rapid growth. Even now, Humes hold key positions in those areas.
7393 : The Galka, a race of hulking humanoids, comprise a third of Bastok's population. Originally hailing from Zepwell, they came to this land over six hundred years ago.
7394 : Without their incomparable strength, the countless ore mines that drive Bastok's economy would never have been dug.
7395 : Adventurers seeking fame and fortune flock to rising nations like Bastok. You are one of them.
7396 : Your story begins here, amid the smoke and bustle of the industrial city of Bastok.
7397 : Hey, Gwill! Is it true? You really saw Captain Volker!?
7398 : Are you really, really sure? We're talking about the captain of the Mythril Musketeers here!
7399 : I'm telling you, I'm sure! I saw him walking toward the Mines District. I bet you he's investigating something!
7400 : Yeah, right! Like you'd ever know!
7401 : ...
7402 : Hey, didn't you say you wanted to become a Mythril Musketeer someday?
7403 : You're too slow. They'd never take you! Besides, Galka can't become Musketeers! Even if they did, they'd never become captains!
7404 : That's not true! Two of the five Mythril Musketeers are Galka...
7405 : But one of 'em disappeared a long time ago, right? He doesn't count!
7406 : And...and...there was even a Galka who was supposed to become a captain, once...
7407 : Ha! That's a laugh! Whoever told you that?
7408 : Gumbah, from the Mines District...
7409 : He's just a kid! What would he know?
7410 : And I can't believe you'd hang around that dirty ol' place! Well, we're not playing with grubby Mines people like you!
7411 : Hey, hey. What's all this bickering about?
7412 : Dad! Are you going adventuring again?
7413 : I am. I'll be gone awhile, but if you don't get along with the other kids, I won't bring you any presents...
7414 : Yes, sir!
7415 : You're going too, Mister Dalzakk?
7416 : Yes. Be good and look after my place for me, Gwill.
7417 : Hey, let's go play over there!
7418 : H-hey, guys! Wait for me!
7419 : Well then, let's... Oh?
7420 : You're an adventurer too, I see. Ah, but you're still new, aren't you? I can't ask you to come with us, then.
7421 : Like Dalzakk and myself have done, you should try to find a party of people who are the same level as you.
7422 : ...We do not always adventure together...
7423 : ...Right. Is there anything we can help you with? What is it you want to do first?
7424 : For starters, I'd like to... Fight monsters! Go shopping. Find some work.
7425 : Then you want to be outside the city walls. Head southwest of here and you'll find the West Gate.
7426 : Always check your target's strength before engaging it and make sure it won't eat you whole.
7427 : You're standing in the Bastok Markets. You should find everything you need in this district.
7428 : On the Kulatz Bridge near the West Gate you'll find the Dragon's Claws weaponry store, Brunhilde's armor shop, and Mjoll's goods shop. Sororo's magic shop and the entrance to the Metalworks are in the northern section.
7429 : Setting goals for yourself, that's good. What kind of work are you looking for?
7430 : What do you want to do? Serve Bastok. Help people. Get rich, quick.
7431 : Ah, a patriot! You want to talk to a guard in charge of assigning missions. You should be able to find one at the West Gate. That's southwest of here.
7432 : Hmm... I don't think I know anyone in need of help right now.
7433 : I do. Her name is Michea. She's an Elvaan who lives next door to me. Could you talk to her and see if you can help?
7434 : Go to the Kulatz Bridge near the West Gate. There you will see three buildings with shops in them. Michea lives on the second floor of the middle building.
7435 : Why don't you help her yourself?
7436 : ...
7437 : Fine, I won't ask. Well, there you have it.
7438 : Then you should go to Gold Street, where Bastok's rich and famous live. It runs along the canal east of here. You should have no trouble finding some high-paying work there.
7439 : Anyway...here, take this %. Give it to a guard named Reet, and she'll give you some starting money.
7440 : You can find her...
7441 : Here. Open the Map from the main menu on the right if you want to check it again.
7442 : Use Trade from the main menu to give items to people. Reet will tell you more about that.
7443 : Well, we really should be going. Good luck on your travels, adventurer.
7444 : I say, are you an adventurer? Looking for some work?
7445 : Are you looking for work? Yes. No.
7446 : Then I have no business with you. Out, I say! Out!
7447 : Let me introduce myself. I am Horatius, the foremost gem collector in all of Bastok.
7448 : I've collected every single kind of precious gem, but now I want to get my hands on a rare stone of a different kind.
7449 : I'd like to get my hands on something called %.
7450 : As you can guess from the name, the Dangruf Wadi is where you'd want to look. What's more, legend says that it can only be found on bright, sunny days.
7451 : If you manage to get your hands on %, bring it to me. You will be greatly rewarded.
7452 : Ah! %! Good work, good work! Here is your reward!
7453 : What a strange, wondrous stone... I think I want more of these!
7454 : My husband says he's a collector, but I must say he doesn't have much taste.
7455 : He simply doesn't know what to do with all that money he made during the Crystal War forging cannons for the Republic.
7456 : Well, well. What do we have here? An adventurer, I'd say. Yes, you do have that eager look on your face.
7457 : Well, since you're here, you might as well do some work for me. A monster took my parcel from the courier who was carrying it.
7458 : The courier said that he was attacked near the lighthouse in South Gustaberg. The adventurer I sent before failed to catch it, and the beast won't come out anymore.
7459 : There must be a way to lure it out. I would have asked Dalzakk--he is very informed in such matters--but he's out of town, adventuring. <Sigh> What is it with you people and this adventuring business?
7460 : If you manage to bring it back to me, though, I'll give you a reward. I know that's what you people want.
7461 : If you're looking for Mister Dalzakk, he's gone adventuring for a while.
7462 : The monster in the lighthouse? Yeah, actually, I've heard Mister Dalzakk talk about it before. I think you have to put % behind the lighthouse to lure it out.
7463 : He said you have to Trade with selectable points on the field to use or place items. Does that help?
7464 : Good, you got it. Here's your reward.
7465 : Bastok is a wellspring of rare and precious gems...and I swear on my collector's pride, I will have them all!
7466 : Hmm? What do you want from me? Get out! Out!
7467 : If you're looking for Mister Dalzakk, he's out adventuring. He lets me stay here and read his books while he's away.
7468 : Hm? What's this I'm reading now? It's called The Chronicles of Prien the Brave. It's the biography of some famous president that ruled during the Crystal War.
7469 : I first picked the book up because of the interesting engravings on its binding, but after reading a few pages, I felt a deeper connection to the story.
7470 : I wonder if it has something to do with the bronze bullet I found myself clenching upon my rebirth...
7471 : Well met, adventurer. My name is Nudara. I was once master of this fine guild. I now occasionally drop in to give advice to the young adepts, though they rarely have the time to lend their ears to the musings of a grizzled, old goldsmith.
7472 : As you can see, these days, exotic metals such as platinum and orichalcum line the guild's shelves like weeds in a garden.
7473 : However, when I was still young, the distribution of most all metals, from bronze to silver, was regulated by the Republic. It was a struggle to find enough resources to forge a simple ring.
7474 : It was regulations such as those that impelled us to focus on our techniques. It gave young soldiers a reason to spend a whole month's wages on something special to leave their loved ones before marching off to the front.
7475 : I shall always treasure the thought that my skill brought a glimmer of happiness in an age so filled with sorrow.
7476 : <Yawn> Guess I'll skip work today, too...
7477 : Oops...you heard that? I work in the Metalworks, you see, but my work there is pretty boring. Doing the same thing over and over, every day of the week... It really gets to you after a while, you know?
7478 : Take Firewater Circle, for instance. I heard that during the Crystal War, there used to be a giant tower right where the fountain is. Now wouldn't that be a sight to see?
7479 : <Sigh>... Why can't there be a new war, or something? Then, I could quit this dead-end job and enlist in the Republican Legion!
7480 : With my brains, I'd be a commander in no time! Just don't ask me to go to the front lines... I have this thing about dying...
7481 : Hungry Wolf told you about %? Yeah, he's a real gourmand, that one. Much like myself.
7482 : It's really hard to make, and takes years of practice to perfect it and all that, but if you get this one special ingredient, even you can make one. Wanna know what that special ingredient is?
7483 : It's Goblins. No, not the Goblins themselves, silly. They make this campfire up in the mountains that's got these special properties, see? All you have to do is stick % in it for just a little while...
7484 : And presto! You get %! It's as simple as that. Getting up there's not easy, but that shouldn't be a problem for an adventurer like you.
7485 : An adventuring friend of mine brought one back to me once, and mmm-mmm! Boy, was it delicious!!!
7486 : You can put items up for sale or bid for items at this auction house.
7487 : Personally, I believe that the joy of bidding and buying items at these auctions is a privilege only true connoisseurs, such as myself, can fully appreciate.
7488 : Here in the Markets, they sell instruments, jewelry, weapons, armor, goods... Anything anyone could ever want!
7489 : The future of this city is as bright as mine!
7490 : My dad says that in this city, you can do anything as long as you have the money to pay for it!
7491 : Emrys is bragging how he's already finished collecting all his stamps! I haven't even started the stamp hunt yet!
7492 : I wasn't bragging!
7493 : Say, can you go do it in my place? I can give you a reward. My family's rich, you know? Here, take my %.
7494 : You're here for the stamp hunt? Why are adventurers doing it, I wonder. Never mind, here's your stamp.
7495 : You received a stamp!
7496 : Thanks! Here you go!
7497 : Arawn and I are neighbors, you know.
7498 : The house at the far end of this canal is Arawn's house. Mine is next door to the west, across from Harmodios's Music Shop.
7499 : This bridge connects the Mines and the Markets Districts.
7500 : The Galka in the Mines District are a rough lot. To tell you the truth, I'm glad I'm not on post there.
7501 : My husband's always off adventuring, my son is out playing all day, and my stepfather keeps rambling about the strangest things...
7502 : Augh! I miss being single...
7503 : Oh, no! We're out of % again. I wonder why...
7504 : I can't cook without fire, but I don't have time to go shopping! Say, can you spare any %? If you have four of them, I'll buy them off you.
7505 : Great! Thank you! Here's your money. Now, stand back! It's cooking time!
7506 : I'm sorry, I don't need any more % for now.
7507 : Hmm? Ah, the hot springs in the Dangruf Wadi? Those were great! I felt like a new man after bathing there!
7508 : I wish they had been built back when I was a legion praefectus...
7509 : You wanna make money? Buy cheap, and sell high! That's my motto!
7510 : The merchants in the city are all crooks! Don't buy from them--they'll rob you blind! Buy items cheap from people who don't need them.
7511 : Then sell them to people who do--for more than what you bought them for, of course! Check people out to see what kind of items they're likely to be looking for. That's how you do business!
7512 : You look surprised. You find it unusual to see a lady of high birth standing in her own kitchen, perhaps?
7513 : I believe that cooking is a refined hobby worthy of one such as me. I only use the best ingredients gil can buy, of course.
7514 : Well now, what should I make today? Oh, I have not done the groceries yet...do you happen to have anything to spare?
7515 : Breakfast, breakfast, I wonder what's for breakfast? Maybe, maybe, just maybe, a salad with %?
7516 : Lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch, I wonder what's for lunch? Maybe, maybe, just maybe, a stew with %?
7517 : Dinner, dinner, I wonder what's for dinner? Maybe, maybe, just maybe, delicious, sauted %?
7518 : Mom is cooking, la, la, la. But I'm just looking, la, la, la.
7519 : %! Why, that's just what I need to make this dish! Here's something for your trouble.
7520 : Oh, %. I guess this will do. Here, let me pay you.
7521 : Thanks to you, I'll make the best dish yet!
7522 : I'm a goldsmith, but I don't work for the guild.
7523 : True goldsmiths are artists and artisans. But the goldsmiths in the guild only make the same trinkets over and over again. That's just not right!
7524 : As people walk these streets, most of them marvel at the Hume technology that was used in building the waterwheels and drawbridges of this city.
7525 : But we Galka were the ones who built the foundations of Bastok, making it possible for those Hume contraptions to exist. Alas, Humes forget so easily...
7526 : It's either poorly-guarded poor houses, or well-guarded well-to-do houses... How am I supposed to work under these conditions?
7527 : What kind of work do I do? I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you! Hah hah hah. Just kidding.
7528 : Yes? Are you in need of assistance?
7529 : Ask for directions? Ask. Don't ask.
7530 : Which area do you want to know about?
7531 : Which area do you want to know about? The Mog House, Metalworks, and the port. The shops and the Mines District. The Kulatz Bridge and the West Gate.
7532 : First, go north from here, then turn east and go down the steps to get to the entrance of the residential area.
7533 : You can put your inventory in order or change jobs in your Mog House there.
7534 : There is also another entrance to the residential area on the other side of that big building to the left.
7535 : If you go north at the intersection instead, you'll come across the entrance to the Metalworks.
7536 : The Metalworks is Bastok's center. It's a complex of metal forges, the Blacksmiths' Guild, and all administrative buildings including the President's Office.
7537 : Walk further north, passing the other entrance to the residential area on your right, and go down the steps...
7538 : ...through a small housing area where you'll find the magic shop, and you'll be at the entrance to the port.
7539 : The Port District is where you'll find the air travel agency, the tavern, the drawbridge, and the North Gate.
7540 : From here you can see on the left, in order, the Goldsmiths' Guild and the jewelry store. Further back along the canal is a housing area.
7541 : On the right is the area where street vendors set up shop, and further down you'll find more houses and the music store.
7542 : If you go down the stairs and head south, you'll come to the entrance to the Mines District.
7543 : The Mines District is where you'll find the Zeruhn Mines, the Alchemists' Guild, and the South Gate.
7544 : On the other side of this fountain is the auction house. You can bid for items or put your own items up for sale at the auctioneer's window.
7545 : The Galkan deliveryman there can also send items to people's houses as well as your own.
7546 : To the south of the auction house is the Kulatz Bridge. The weapons, armor, and goods shops are there.
7547 : If you cross the bridge, you'll come to the West Gate. Walk through the gate to go to South Gustaberg.
7548 : You should be able to find one of the guards in charge of assigning missions, and a high guard in charge of conquests, nearby.
7549 : Come back and ask me again if you need further assistance.
7550 : You are at Bastok's West Gate. Go through the gate if you want to go to South Gustaberg.
7551 : The entrance to the Metalworks, Bastok's administrative and manufacturing center, is just a few steps to the north.
7552 : If you go further north, you'll be on the road leading to Port Bastok.
7553 : Over there to the east is the entrance to the residential area where your Mog House is located.
7554 : From the square to the west, you can access various shops, the West Gate, and the road to the Bastok Mines.
7555 : Just south of that intersection is the entrance to the Metalworks. You'll find the administrative buildings and forges there.
7556 : If you go further south, you'll come to the central square. From there, you can access the West Gate, the Mines, and various shops.
7557 : The entrance to the residential area is to the east. You can use the Mog Houses there.
7558 : If you go down these steps toward the north, you'll be able to see the entrance to Port Bastok.
7559 : This is the entrance to the Metalworks, the heart of Bastok.
7560 : In it you'll find the Blacksmiths' Guild, the forges, the consulates, and the President's Office.
7561 : This is the entrance to Port Bastok. The air travel agency, the tavern, and the North Gate can all be found in the port.
7562 : On the other side of this canal are the Goldsmiths' Guild and Carmelide's jewelry store.
7563 : On this side, down that way you'll find Harmodios's Music Shop and the housing area.
7564 : These stairs leading west are a shortcut to the entrance to the Mines District.
7565 : On the other side of that canal are the Goldsmiths' Guild and the jewelry store. On this side, you'll find the music shop and some houses.
7566 : Walk west along the canal and up the steps to get to the central square. From there, you can access the Metalworks and the West Gate.
7567 : What should I do? It's times like these I wish I was a member of the guild...
7568 : Oh, hello there. You're an adventurer, are you not? I could really use your help.
7569 : I'm a goldsmith...yes, I know that most people think the Elvaan are no good at that kind of craft. Nevertheless, that is what I do.
7570 : For my own reasons, I am not a member of the Goldsmiths' Guild. But because of that, I am having trouble collecting the materials I need for my work...
7571 : I'd be indebted to you if you could bring me %.
7572 : Thank you! With this, I can finally complete my customer's order. Here, this is for you. Thank you again.
7573 : Ah! An adventurrrer! Good, good! I need your help!
7574 : I want to give % to my daughter as a present, but I could only get my paws on %.
7575 : Could you make it into % and give it to my daughter? Of course, I'm not asking you to do it for nothing. I have enough to pay you.
7576 : I'd do it myself, if it weren't for that guard over there. I think she's got me marrrked. Anyway, here's the %.
7577 : Why is the guard watching me? Oh, it's nothing for you to worry about. By the way, my place is in the Mines District, in the lower level housing area. There aren't that many Mithra around, so it shouldn't be too harrrd to find.
7578 : Damned guard! I've got to make a living, too! Come on, look the other way!
7579 : There have been numerous reports of burglaries and pick pocketing in this area lately. Hmm...that Mithra looks mighty suspicious.
7580 : So, did you do it? What's that? A letter from my daughter? Oh, how sweet!
7581 : Be patient, my little kitten--Mom's gonna work hard for you! Oh, wait...I should give you this first. Thanks again!
7582 : Wait... You've read this, haven't you? That's not very commendable, you know? Still, I should pay you for your work.
7583 : Oh, hi! I've been looking for you! I need you to do something for me again. You're a good person and I trust you, so I'm going to tell you this...
7584 : I recently got some information about a treasure! It's supposed to be buried under one of the signposts on the Konschtat Highlands.
7585 : I'd go myself, but I got this other thing I have to take care of first...
7586 : But I wouldn't want anyone else to take it before I do, so I thought of asking you, my trusty sidekick! If whatever's buried there is worth anything, I'll be happy to buy it off you.
7587 : So, could you go get it and bring it to my house? Have a chat with my daughter and wait if I'm not there. I'll try to shake that guard off my tail before then.
7588 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Sarutabaruta, but it's not easy getting stuff out of areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
7589 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Kolshushu, but it's not easy getting stuff out of areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
7590 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Aragoneu, but it's not easy getting stuff out of areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
7591 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Elshimo, but it's not easy getting stuff out of areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
7592 : What can I do for you?
7593 : Welcome!
7594 : Hello. Do you have time? I need your help. I was thinking of giving Mister Dalzakk next door a present...
7595 : You see, when I lost both my parents to the war twenty years ago, Mister Dalzakk took me under his wing, even though I was Elvaan. He is like a father to me, and I love him dearly.
7596 : I want to show him that the time and money he spent raising me wasn't a waste. I want to make him a present with what I do best--goldsmithing.
7597 : This is what I need your help with. Could you get % for me? I will reward you with what I can.
7598 : Thank you! It isn't much, but I want you to have this. I must get to work right away!
7599 : Hi! You're the adventurer who helped Michea make her present, aren't you?
7600 : I'm making Mister Dalzakk a present, too, and I need your help! I'm missing %, for the final touch! Do you have any? Could you bring me some?
7601 : Thanks! Now I can finish my present!
7602 : Gwill! Mister Dalzakk's back!
7603 : Oh, no! So soon!?
7604 : Hmm? What is all this racket?
7605 : Welcome back, Mister Dalzakk! Uh... Michea, you first!
7606 : Mister Dalzakk...I made this for you. It's a good luck charm to protect you on your travels. See? Don't you agree I have nothing to learn from that guild?
7607 : Yes, I must say you've become quite an artisan. But artisans should never work for free, Michea.
7608 : I knew you'd say that. Just think of it as a payment from me to you, for all the years you've taken care of me... Thank you for everything, Mister Dalzakk.
7609 : I...I made you a present, too. It's for letting me stay here and read your books.
7610 : You have been practicing with your sword as well, I hope? Remember what I've told you: though studying is important, no scholar has ever become a Musketeer nor an adventurer.
7611 : Augh... No, I haven't forgotten, Mister Dalzakk...
7612 : I am sorry, Gwill. I did not mean to sound critical. Thank you for your gifts. They mean a lot to me. Alas, I must be off again. Gwill, would you take care of the house for me?
7613 : And Michea, do you now have an answer to my riddle about the true value of the red rose?
7614 : Yes. Each person might see a different shade of red, but the fact that we can all agree on its beauty--that is a miracle.
7615 : A wise answer. The day I will have to call you Master Artisan Michea is nearer than I thought.
7616 : Huh? What? What red rose?
7617 : Gwill, have you ever wondered if everyone sees the same color when they look at a rose?
7618 : What if, when people say red, they don't mean the same hue as you or I?
7619 : You mean...just because everyone says fires and sunsets are red, they're not actually seeing the same color?
7620 : Yes. And if so, is the red rose truly beautiful, as it is said to be?
7621 : Oh! And so your answer was: even if everyone doesn't see the same thing the same way, it's wonderful that they can all agree on a thing of beauty--like a red rose!
7622 : That is the answer, Gwill. I see you've studied Mister Dalzakk's books well.
7623 : Heh-heh!
7624 : I think sometimes life works the same way, too. Like us, for example. We might be of different races and ages, but here, today, in this small room above the Kulatz Bridge, we were able to share the same few moments of joy and wonderment.
7625 : And that's...a miracle, right?
7626 : Yes, our own little miracle, Gwill.
7627 : What is one to do, I wonder-blunder.
7628 : You! You're an adventurer, yes-yes? And you've got umption in your gumption, by the looks of it! Then you can help me!
7629 : I'm compiling a tome on magic spells. It's almost complete--I just need a page on curses!
7630 : But curses are scary-wary! They're not for socially upstanding folk like myself! That's where you come in!
7631 : I need you to carry-harry this % to the Quadav stronghold in Beadeaux, and be cursed by both types of statues--the Mutes and the Afflictors!
7632 : When that's done, the % will have captured their secrets! Bring it back quick-slick, and my tome will be complete!
7633 : Good! The % is full! I can finally finish my research! Heh-heh-heh...
7634 : Oh yes, your reward! Here, they're yours, they're yours!
7635 : My research is nearing completion! Heh-heh-heh...
7636 : Hah! Yah! I'm still alive and kickin'! Do you want to know how I can be so energetic at my age? I'll tell you if you bring me the secret ingredient of my formula!
7637 : Do you see that old Hume over there who seems a little too young for his age? I've seen an adventurer bring him % once.
7638 : Rumor says that he grinds those % into a powder and swallows some every day.
7639 : A sad story indeed, if true. Imagine, eating the remains of the dead in hopes of keeping death itself at bay!
7640 : Yes, that is the secret ingredient! Ah, but it's not what you think--I don't eat this, as some seem to think.
7641 : I keep it in a pocket close to my heart to remind myself of my own mortality. That is my secret. Hmm... Maybe you're still a little too young to understand.
7642 : Hah! Yah! I'm still alive and kickin'!
7643 : This is the Goldsmiths' Guild. Do not enter the premises unless you have business with the guild.
7644 : Hmm... This % seems to have some traces of mythril in it. Not enough to be worth much, unfortunately.
7645 : I'm willing to buy it off you, but I can't offer you more than ten gil for it.
7646 : Sell it for 10 gil? Yes. No.
7647 : Here you go.
7648 : Are you going back to Windurst? I'm sorry I could not make your trip here worthwhile.
7649 : Yes? The stone you sold me the other day? You mean the one with the traces of mythril?
7650 : I'm sorry, but I believe it has already been used by one of our guild members in his work.
7651 : Yeah? You a fisherman?
7652 : Have you ever fished? Yes. No.
7653 : Then I got no business with you. Get lost.
7654 : All right, then you got any %? Don't take it the wrong way, I'm not sayin' you ain't good at it or anything. Everyone starts by catching those, yeah?
7655 : If you got some lyin' around, I'll buy them off you. Five at a time only. Deal?
7656 : What do I do with them? Business, ya' know, business. I wipe 'em clean and sell 'em off. Those big shots in the Metalworks buy 'em like crazy.
7657 : One piece of advice, if you wanna start a business of your own: buy cheap, sell high. There's another reason why I can make a living sellin' buckets, tho.
7658 : People just love spending gil that's not theirs. And no one spends more than those big shots in the Metalworks. Makes my job easy.
7659 : Right, that's five of 'em. Good doin' business with ya'. I hope you don't get better at fishing any time soon, heh heh.
7660 : Hey. My name's Julio. I'm an unlicensed alchemist. Heh-heh.
7661 : I know what you want--you want to see my Chart of Elemental Correlations, right?
7662 : See Chart of Elemental Correlations? Yes. No.
7663 : What!? Not interested, are you!? Then leave me alone! Get lost! Shoo!
7664 : I thought so! Take a look at this!
7665 : Do you know the prime elements? They are the eight elements and energies that control the universe. This chart shows their interrelationship.
7666 : See here? The six on the outside ring are in cyclical ascendancy over each other.
7667 : So this shows that: water quenches fire, fire melts ice, and ice stands against wind...
7668 : Furthermore: wind eats away earth, earth absorbs lightning, and lightning boils water.
7669 : The two in the middle, light and darkness, are in direct opposition to each other.
7670 : One more thing--these elements also affect your physical status.
7671 : Would you like me to explain in detail?
7672 : Ask for more details? Yes. No.
7673 : Each status ailment is related to an element: disease to fire, bind to ice, silence to wind, paralysis to earth, stun to lightning, and poison to water.
7674 : Charm is related to light, while blindness, curse, and sleep are all related to darkness.
7675 : If you wear equipment that has certain elemental affinities, it will help you avoid the corresponding status ailments.
7676 : Man or beast, tree or sea, all things are made of these eight elements. This knowledge should help you see the world as it truly is.
7677 : Need something sent to a friend's house? Sending items to your own room? You've come to the right place!
7678 : My, my, what a scruffy-looking adventurer! You can't walk around dressed like that! Not if I, Brygid, stylist extraordinaire, have anything to say about it!
7679 : Let me see... For a person of your size and build, % and % should do the trick! Yes, I can see it now! You'll look fabulous!
7680 : Don't worry, I won't charge you this time. Trust me and go shopping!
7681 : See, what did I tell you? You look marvelous, darling. And you should put these on, too. Wear them, they're yours!
7682 : Yes? You have an order for an Elvaan goldsmith? Why, I'm the only Elvaan goldsmith in this town...
7683 : Ah, of course, it's from Aunt Femitte. Only she could be so oblique.
7684 : All right, I'll do it. But I'm missing the key material. Do you have %? I'll need one to make this.
7685 : I need %. Please find one and bring it to me.
7686 : Thank you. I'll start working right away. Please come back a while later.
7687 : I've finished the item aunt Femitte ordered. Please take it back carefully.  And do tell my aunt and Rouva that I said hello.
7688 : Rouva said that? Yes...I suppose I can talk about it now. I was, of course, devastated that my relatives would reject me.
7689 : But Aunt Femitte told me then that even if everyone else didn't want me back, I would always be welcome in her home. That meant a lot to me.
7690 : But I can't leave yet. First, I've got to try to make a name for myself here. Imagine an Elvaan girl becoming famous in Bastok! That is my goal and my dream.
7691 : Welcome to the Goldsmiths' Guild shop. What can I do for you?
7692 : Welcome to the Goldsmiths' Guild shop. How may I help you?
7693 : Hello! Welcome to the only weaponry store in Bastok, the Dragon's Claws!
7694 : A weapon is the most precious thing to an adventurer! Well, after his life, of course. Choose wisely.
7695 : Hey! I've got just the thing for you!
7696 : Welcome to my store! You want armor, you want shields? I've got them all!
7697 : Hello. What piece of armor are you missing?
7698 : Feeling defenseless of late? Brunhilde's Armory has got you covered!
7699 : Welcome. Have a look and compare! You'll never find better wares anywhere.
7700 : Welcome to Mjoll's Goods! What can I do for you?
7701 : Greetings. What spell are you looking for?
7702 : Hello-mellow, welcome to Sororo's Scribe and Notary! Hmm? No, we sell magic spells! What did you think?
7703 : Add music to your adventuring life! Welcome to Harmodios's.
7704 : Ah, welcome, welcome! What might I interest you in?
7705 : Give a smile to that special someone! Welcome to Carmelide's.
7706 : Hello there! We have instruments and music sheets at Harmodios's!
7707 : Hello there! Might I interest you in some specialty goods from Aragoneu?
7708 : Hello! I've got some goods from Kolshushu--interested?
7709 : Welcome! I have goods straight from Sarutabaruta! What say you?
7710 : Welcome to the auction house. Do you have any questions about our establishment?
7711 : What do you want to know? What is the auction house? How are auctions run? Are there any fees? Are there any limits? How do you check up on merchandise? How do you remove an item? My Sales Status list is full! Nothing right now.
7712 : Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.
7713 : Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.
7714 : Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.
7715 : The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.
7716 : Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).
7717 : If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.
7718 : Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.
7719 : A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.
7720 : The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.
7721 : However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.
7722 : A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.
7723 : Once an item appears on your Sales Status list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.
7724 : If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select Stop Sale from the Sales Status menu.
7725 : To remove an item from your Sales Status list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.
7726 : Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.
7727 : At any auction counter, open the Sales Status menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.
7728 : Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).
7729 : Is there anything else you would like to know?
7730 : In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!
7731 : Vana'diel is abuzz with Adventurer Appreciation fever, kupo!
7732 : We moogles have prepared some nice little goodies and gathered lots of top-secret information on adventurer activity, kupo! Let me check my journal for your statistical data...

7740 : Ah, I understand. With some many goodies to choose from, it's no surprise that you'd want to think about it a bit more. I'll be here once you've decided, kupo.
7741 : %? (# remaining) Yes. No.
7742 : An excellent choice! I hope you enjoy your brand-new %!
7743 : There's your adventuring life in a nutshell! And because it seems you're so eager to get your hands on some more goodies, I guess I could find it in my heart to spare another...but just for you, kupo!

7784 : Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!

7791 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7792 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7793 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7794 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7795 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7796 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7797 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7798 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7799 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7800 : You've earned conquest points!
7801 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7802 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7803 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7804 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7805 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7806 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7807 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7808 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7809 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7810 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7811 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7812 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7813 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7814 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7815 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7816 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7817 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7818 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7819 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7820 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7821 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7822 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7823 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7824 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7825 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7826 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7827 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7828 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7829 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7830 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7831 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7832 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7833 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7834 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7835 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7836 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7837 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.

7839 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
7840 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
7841 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
7842 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
7843 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
7844 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
7845 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.

7849 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
7850 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
7851 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.

7853 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 200 conquest points.
7854 : During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
7855 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
7856 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.

7876 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.

7880 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
7881 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
7882 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.

7898 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
7899 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
7900 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
7901 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
7902 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
7903 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.

7928 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
7929 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
7930 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
7931 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
7932 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
7933 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
7934 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
7935 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
7936 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
7937 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
7938 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
7939 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
7940 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
7941 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
8131 : PAUSE
8133 : Thank you very much. Gwill was so happy that you talked to Dalzakk.
8134 : To tell you the truth, someone saw you heading to Oggbi's and told me that I should go with you.
8135 : She told me that if I couldn't solve the problem myself, I should ask the help of an adventurer. Only a pampered girl like her would think of such a plan.
8136 : Before, I hated the way she acted...doing nothing on her own, always reaching for the hands of others...
8137 : But now I've begun to realize how she feels. We are in the same situation here in Bastok--looked down upon just because we are a little different.
8138 : And the only way to make people understand us is by proving our worth. She has taught me this through her own experiences. Now I can say that she is a true friend.
8139 : It's funny, isn't it? Who would have thought that a mere Elvaan goldsmith and a girl from a well-to-do family could be best of friends?
8140 : Hm? Who am I talking about? Why, Cornelia, of course. You've met before, haven't you?
8141 : We have completed our mission as well.
8142 : Oh, if it isn't Dalzakk. I see that you've made it home safely.
8143 : Did anything strange happen in the Mines District while I was away? I have a bad feeling about that place.
8144 : It's nothing official, but I did hear from a guard there that...
8145 : Mister Dalzakk! Werei has... Werei has...
8146 : Werei has what, Gwill?
8147 : It seems as if Werei has left on his journey of rebirth.
8148 : I see. We all knew this day would come eventually, but the Galka in the Mines District will still be sorrowful...
8149 : What should we do, Mister Dalzakk?
8150 : Keep calm, Gwill. You cannot live your life always depending on others.
8151 : However, we are all worried. I will make preparations to set out again and investigate Werei's disappearance.
8152 : Well? I'd like a report on the activities of the adventurers.
8153 : Captain Volker! You've returned!
8154 : Cleades, has the restlessness of the Galka in the Mines District begun affecting those in the Bastok Markets?
8155 : Due to the small number of Galka in the Markets, I do not feel that the disappearance of Werei has affected them that much.
8156 : Understood. Where could Zeid be at a time like this?
8157 : Wait. You've been to the Gusgen Mines. People say that you've even seen Zeid. Is this true?
8158 : I see... It is critical for us to get him to come back to Bastok. That may be the only way to ease the restless hearts of the Galka.
8159 : I can't tell what Zeid's thinking. I can only hope that he will see things our way. I apologize for holding you up. I wish you success in your further adventures.
8160 : There has been some commotion in the Mines District near Ore Street. People are saying that a new Talekeeper has appeared.
8161 : It sounds fishy to me, but with the disappearance of their elder, Werei, anything could be possible. And the last thing we want is an uprising by the Galka.
8162 : Go to Ore Street and talk to Medicine Eagle. He says he was there when the commotion started.
8163 : I assume an adventurer of your caliber has heard of Norg.
8164 : Well, the place is a haven for pirates. They even have ties with the Tenshodo. In any case, it's an area that cannot be looked upon lightly.
8165 : That is why we want you to travel there as an emissary. Report to Sir Naji in the President's Office for details.
8166 : Currently, Chief Engineer Cid is conducting research on the architecture in Ro'Maeve near the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. Your next mission is to travel there and assist him.
8167 : Report to the Chief Engineer in the Metalworks for further details.
8168 : We are searching for an adventurer holding vital information dealing with a certain national investigation.
8169 : The president himself has expressed great interest in this case. Proceed to the President's Office for the details of this mission.
8170 : You've been ordered by the president to deliver that %. When you have completed that task, you can return here for your next mission.
8171 : It looks like Bastok is really going to begin an investigation of the Galka homeland of Altepa.
8172 : Your role in this investigation will have you traveling to the Quicksand Caves. Get the details of this mission from Iron Eater in the President's Office.
8173 : As a continuation of Bastok's investigation of Altepa, this time you will be traveling to Zepwell Island.
8174 : You will be carrying out your part of the investigation in the Kuftal Tunnel, which connects Cape Teriggan to Zepwell Island. Report to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines for details.
8175 : Senator Alois has asked for your assistance.
8176 : It is something about an expedition to Vollbow...
8177 : I just hope he's not asking you to go get lizard eggs again... Wait, you didn't hear me say that.
8178 : Recently, an adventurer who was sent to investigate the Northlands has been attacked.
8179 : According to her report, the attacker resembled the dark knight Zeid.
8180 : The strange thing is that the attacker passed a letter to the adventurer before letting her go. Now, this letter's content is causing quite a commotion in the President's Office.
8181 : You have been asked to report directly to President Karst for further details.
8182 : You want me to take a look at this earring? Hmmm...
8183 : Why, that is strange. I had a customer come in the other day and ask me to make an earring just like this. She said she had lost one of the pair.
8184 : I told her that it would be impossible for me to replace the lost earring, so I am sure she would be quite pleased if you returned it to her. I think she said her name was Esca.
8185 : Could you please take that earring to Esca? I am sure she would be quite pleased to have it returned.
8186 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
8187 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.
8188 : Now close your eyes...

8195 : Which memory will you have recalled? None.
8196 : Where could she be? We were supposed to meet here hours ago...
8197 : Oh, you're an adventurer, right? You wouldn't have happened to see my wife, now would you?
8198 : She said she was going to go out shopping for groceries, but she's still not back.
8199 : Does that woman think I like waiting here?
8200 : I bet she's just stopped somewhere to gossip with the local ladies.
8201 : If you're not busy...
8202 : Do you think you could help me search for my wife?
8203 : Her name's Alisa. She's got short, blond hair, and beautiful snow-white skin. She's quite a looker, if you ask me!
8204 : ...
8205 : What's this? You say you're looking for an Alisa?
8206 : What are you talking about? Everybody knows that Alisa died in an accident six months ago.
8207 : Her husband, Zacc, is looking for her?
8208 : <Sigh> The poor soul... The accident was so sudden. Zacc probably still hasn't accepted that his wife is gone.
8209 : It's so terrible, what happened...
8210 : Alisa also left behind a daughter. I think her name was Enu. Losing a parent must be hard on a child so young...
8211 : It's a cruel world we live in where a young mother is taken from her daughter--but an old, useless woman like myself is left behind.
8212 : What the hell do you mean, she's dead!?
8213 : If you're trying to be funny, I'd recommend you stop right now, unless you want a knuckle sandwich.
8214 : She left the house this morning. Grabbed her bag and her gloves, and said that she was going to be right back.
8215 : Talk to him all you want--he won't listen.
8216 : Ever since Mommy died, Daddy's heart's been broken.
8217 : Daddy loved Mommy a whole bunch.
8218 : Hey, would you help my daddy?
8219 : I wanna make him happy again, like when Mommy was alive. That's why I need %.
8220 : % is a super-special secret treasure.
8221 : If you hold % up to the sky on a starry night...
8222 : ...any wish you make will come true...but only for that night.
8223 : You don't believe me? It's true! I read it in a book and everything!
8224 : Please, [Mister/Miss] Adventurer, you've gotta find % for my daddy!
8225 : Remember, % is a super-special secret stone. It can only be found inside a huge tree in a jungle far south of here.
8226 : It has to be a starry night for the % to work. We have to wait a little bit longer.
8227 : Oh! You really found one! You really found my daddy %!
8228 : Thank you soooo much, [Mister/Miss] Adventurer.
8229 : Now I can wish for my mommy to come back!
8230 : %... Please send my mommy back...for just one night.
8231 : My daddy really misses her.
8232 : Please, %! Can't you hear me!?
8233 : No... Why doesn't it work...?
8234 : Enu. You know what I told you about playing so close to the edge there. You could fall and hurt yourself.
8235 : Daddy...
8236 : I wished for Mommy to come back from heaven...but nothing happened...
8237 : The book lied to me! It said that the stars would grant me a wish! But it was all a lie!
8238 : Alisa...in heaven? What are you talking about, Enu?
8239 : She left the house this morning. Grabbed her bag and her gloves, and said that she was going to be...
8240 : Her bag...? What did she say she was going to get...? When did she leave...?
8241 : I can't...remember... Where is she...? Where did she...go?
8242 : The meadow...the meadow beyond the pass. That's where she went.
8243 : She said that she was going there to gather mushrooms. It started to get late, so I...
8244 : I went to look for her!
8245 : Daddy!
8246 : She was there...gathering mushrooms by a cliff near the meadow.
8247 : I was about to call her, when...when she slipped on some gravel...
8248 : ...and fell.
8249 : ...
8250 : She fell from the cliff...
8251 : I was right there, but there was nothing I could do! I was helpless!
8252 : I could only stand there and watch as she fell into the darkness...
8253 : Stand there and watch...
8254 : She's...dead. And I just watched her die... I had just...forgotten.
8255 : No. I didn't forget.
8256 : I knew all along.
8257 : But I didn't want to face the truth...
8258 : Daddy! You remember about Mommy now?
8259 : Yes, I do, sweetheart. With your mom gone, I'm the one who has to take care of you...but I was too caught up in my sorrow.
8260 : Will you ever forgive me, Enu?
8261 : Daddy, I'm sorry that I couldn't bring back Mommy.
8262 : Ha ha. Don't be foolish, sweetheart. Daddy's going to be okay.
8263 : You don't need to wish upon a star to see your mom. She'll always be right here with us.
8264 : ...?
8265 : In your heart, Enu. You can see her, can't you?
8266 : !!!
8267 : I can, Daddy! I can!
8268 : I'm sorry for all the trouble my daughter caused you.
8269 : I don't have much, but take this as a token of my appreciation.
8270 : Don't worry. I'm going to do my best to see that Enu grows up to be as strong as her mother.
8271 : I wouldn't want to let down Alisa!
8272 : The % really did make my wish come true!
8273 : Hah! Yah! How did a young'un like you know that I was a disciple of the bushin?
8274 : A wee little Tarutaru from the Tenshodo? Ha ha ha! He never could stop flapping his gums.
8275 : Well, you got me. I did study martial arts under the grand master once...but that was more than thirty years ago.
8276 : Ah, those were the days...
8277 : I was still young and chock-full of pep.
8278 : Back then, I spent day and night and night and day training to be the best. I had my mind on my muscles and my muscles on my mind. Mighty embarrassing, now that I think of it.
8279 : And then I met Maat...
8280 : To tell you the truth, I never saw the bushin wearing his %. He always had it hidden way back in the back of his dojo.
8281 : He did, though, show it to me once.
8282 : But that was only after I had proved my strength by bringing him %.
8283 : Even after thirty years, the image of that belt remains crisp and clear in my mind. I can still see the deep tones of ebony. They say that the color comes from the blood and sweat of all the bushin that have worn it.
8284 : I'm sure if you proved your might to the bushin and brought him %, he would let you take a peek at the % of legend.
8285 : Trick or treat...
8286 : Thank you... And now for your treat...
8287 : Here, take this...
8288 : If you put this on and walk around, something...unexpected might happen...
8289 : Thank you...
8290 : If two people with the same costumes form a party and approach a bomb balloon, then...
8291 : It's time for the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza, kupo! Here, take this initial egg. Collect and trade eggs until you have made a First 3 combination. When you're done, bring the combo back to me for an egg-squisite prize, kupo!
8292 : This year, those who make special undecennial combinations will receive particularly egg-ceptional prizes, kupo!
8293 : Of course, we wouldn't want you counting your chocobos before they hatch. Please egg-xert the effort to make a First 3 combination before going all out on these spegg-tacular new ones, kupo.
8294 : When you've gathered a First 3 combination, bring the eggs back to me! Also, if you want, I can trade you more initial eggs, but you'll have to make it worth my while, kupo!
8295 : Well, that's it for my anniversary egg-splanation. Happy hunting, kupo!
8296 : Egg-cellent! Here's your prize, kupo! Now if only somebody would bring me a super combo... Oh, egg-scuse me! Forget I said that, kupo!
8297 : Egg-straordinary! Here's your special prize, kupo! But how did you figure out the secret combination...?
8298 : How in-eggs-plicably astounding! You're truly a hard-boiled detective of the highest degree, kupo! Here's your prize, and don't forget to enjoy the rest of the festivities.
8299 : Hey, don't get all egg-cited! You can only claim one prize a day, kupo!
8300 : These initial eggs are really egg-spensive, kupo! If you want one I'm going to need a little more incentive. No egg-ceptions!
8301 : Eggs-actly what I wanted! Here's your reward, kupo!
8302 : Ku-kupo! Such an egg-stravagant item, for little old me? Here's a whole basketful of initial eggs for you, kupo!
8303 : My eyes! My eyes! Get out of here, and take those egg-ceptionally nasty things with you, kupo!
8304 : Kupo... Kupo! Please! No more, kupo! Here, take these and get out of here, kupo!
8305 : Hey, I can only trade with you once a day. We wouldn't want to make the egg hunt over easy, now, kupo!
8306 : Hey, you look new here, kupo! If you need anything, just let me know!
8307 : Heh heh heh... I have something egg-specially egg-citing in store for you, kupo!
8308 : And, because you're [as cool as egg salad/as hot as a fried egg, sunny-side up], I'm going to give you a super-duper present, kupo!
8309 : Take any one you want! An "A" egg. A "B" egg. A "C" egg. A "D" egg. An "E" egg. An "F" egg. A "G" egg. An "H" egg. An "I" egg. A "J" egg. A "K" egg. An "L" egg. An "M" egg. An "N" egg. An "O" egg. A "P" egg. A "Q" egg. An "R" egg. An "S" egg. A "T" egg. A "U" egg. A "V" egg. A "W" egg. An "X" egg. A "Y" egg. A "Z" egg. Forget it.
8310 : There are no party members.
8311 : Ku.........po! I can't egg-cept such a rare item. You should take more care of your belongings, kupo!
8312 : Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
8313 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
8314 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
8315 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
8316 : You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
8317 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
8318 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
8319 : Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
8320 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
8321 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
8322 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
8323 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
8324 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
8325 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
8326 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
8327 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
8328 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
8329 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
8330 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
8331 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
8332 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
8333 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
8334 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
8335 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
8336 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
8337 : You can only carry one %.
8338 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
8339 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
8340 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
8341 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
8342 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
8343 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
8344 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
8345 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
8346 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
8347 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
8348 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
8349 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
8350 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
8351 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...

8395 : <Match #> Entry period begins:  Briefing begins:
8396 : I apologize, but your level is too low to participate in an official Brenner match.
8397 : Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times: Match 1: # Match 2:  Match 3:
8398 : Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of # gil is required before each match.
8399 : Travel to the Isle? Yes. Not yet.
8400 : What would you like to know about? Basic rules. Official/private matches. Flammen-Brenner. Flamme. Match score. Petras and quarrying. Sprint. KO. Return.
8401 : The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:
8402 : First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of Flammen-Brenner.
8403 : At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with Flamme, or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
8404 : Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
8405 : The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
8406 : The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
8407 : If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The match score section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
8408 : Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
8409 : You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
8410 : No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
8411 : The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed # members, or if there are fewer than # members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
8412 : Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
8413 : LS Liga is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
8414 : A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
8415 : The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
8416 : If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
8417 : After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
8418 : Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
8419 : In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
8420 : Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
8421 : Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
8422 : However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
8423 : Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
8424 : Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
8425 : The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
8426 : In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
8427 : In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
8428 : I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
8429 : Are you sure you'll be all right? I could always go for you.
8430 : Would you just get off my case? If I don't go by myself, I'll never pass the test!
8431 : But... I'm so worried. What if one of those terrible Goblins finds you?
8432 : Do you have enough potions? What about your map? Remember not to drink any of the water from those dirty springs.
8433 : Ah, an adventurer! It is your job to help people, right? Are you interested in becoming a bodyguard for my little brother?
8434 : Sis! What do you think you're doing!? I'll be fine on my own!
8435 : Hey, no offense or anything, but this is a family problem.
8436 : Okay? Okay. I wasn't talking to you, squirt.
8437 : Good. Now will you go kill some bees or something? This is none of your business.
8438 : Oh, thank you so much! Let me explain the job.
8439 : My brother has taken it upon himself to apply for the military academy. I tried to stop him, but he simply won't listen to reason. Anyway, he has been given an entrance examination that requires him to travel to the Dangruf Wadi and survey a part of the area.
8440 : Dangruf Wadi... Just the name of that place gives me goose bumps! All those lizards and leeches... They're sure to eat Ken alive!
8441 : Why don't you trust me, Sis? That place is a joke! The test orders don't say I have to go in very deep. As long as I get some interesting data, I'll pass with flying colors.
8442 : Come on. Just imagine what the other recruits would think if they found out I had a babysitter during the mission. I'd be laughed out of the academy!
8443 : If I don't become a soldier, our family will never have enough money to do anything! I'm tired of seeing Mom suffer...
8444 : But think of how Mom would suffer if you were brought back from your test in a body bag! She would... I would...
8445 : No! I cannot let you go by yourself!
8446 : Please, [sir/ma'am]! Protect my brother during his test! I promise I'll find something to reward you with!
8447 : Accept the job? You can count on me! I don't like kids.
8448 : Count on you!? But I don't need you! Go on! Don't you have some wild onions to deliver!?
8449 : Oh, thank you thank you thank you thank you! Now I can rest easy knowing that a powerful adventurer will be by Ken's side.
8450 : Hmph... You can tag along if you like--just don't get in my way!
8451 : The Wadi is an evil place crawling with ferocious beasts. Don't allow any of them to lay a finger on my brother.
8452 : See, I told you. Adventurers have better things to do than watch over guys who can handle things on their own.
8453 : Oh, what am I to do... I don't want to be an only child...
8454 : Please, [sir/ma'am]! I ask you again, protect my brother during his test! I promise I'll make it worth your while!
8455 : What's wrong? You haven't begun to have second thoughts, have you?
8456 : Second thoughts? And third thoughts. No, everything's fine.
8457 : And after you said you'd help me! If anything happens to my brother, I'll curse you until you die!
8458 : Sis, would you stop worrying!?
8459 : Cheat!? Who's a cheat!? I didn't cheat! Where's their proof!?
8460 : My brother was accused of cheating on his military academy entrance examination and has been ordered to take a make-up test...
8461 : Please, will you accompany him?
8462 : Babysit Marin's brother? No problem. Not this time.
8463 : Thank you so much for watching over my brother. Now that the test is over, he seems to be in a much better mood.
8464 : Here is the reward I promised you.
8465 : That test was a piece of cake! If that's all the Republican Army has to offer, I'll be a seven-star admiral in no time!
8466 : I do hope that you pass...
8467 : Don't worry, Sis. I'll get in the academy for sure!
8468 : My, my, if it isn't the scruffy-looking adventurer!
8469 : Don't tell me you're still wearing that robe. I mean, it is so last Firesday!
8470 : What is that atrocious outfit you're wearing? Artifact armor? I've seen more original garb on a Goblin!
8471 : Are you still wearing those artifact rags? When are you going to break out of your shell and show off your true colors?
8472 : Do you think you look tough in those scraps of leather and metal? And why do you feel obliged to show off your lint-filled bellybutton?
8473 : Whoever designed that thing you have on must have been colorblind or working in a very dark atelier.
8474 : White mage equals white robes... Give me a break! My pet Opo-opo could come up with a fresher idea.
8475 : Maybe you think that outfit makes you look all intelligent, but it obviously didn't make you intelligent enough to realize you were breaking all fashion laws!
8476 : You're not planning to wear that all the way to level 75, are you? When are you going to learn to live a little?
8477 : Ugh! That terrible design makes you stick out like a sore thumb at a hitchhikers' convention!
8478 : Those hunks of scrap metal give you about as much appeal as a rusty bucket!
8479 : What's with all the spikes? What are you trying to do, put someone's eye out?
8480 : [Mister/Lady], you're dressed up like a mad sheep... Do I have to say any more?
8481 : Don't you have a mirror in your Mog House? You look about as color coordinated as one of those lizards strolling around Valkurm.
8482 : What? Are you going for the I spent all my gil on arrows so I didn't have any left to buy real clothes look?
8483 : Nice outfit... You'd better take that back to the museum before they call the police.
8484 : Yes, wearing your pajamas outside around town will catch all the [ladies'/guys'] eyes, but I don't think that's the kind of attention you want.
8485 : Don't tell me... You're joining the circus and one of those rejects from the Troupe Valeriano made that gawd-awful thing for you.
8486 : You'd think after spending time with all those chic avatars, a shred of their fashion sense would have rubbed off on you...
8487 : Oh please, blue is so last season! You are allowed to wear other colors, you know...
8488 : So, you walk around like that without getting arrested? The fashion police must be getting soft...
8489 : Why, exactly, does what you're wearing have anything to do with puppets? Maybe you should stand behind a screen when you perform...
8490 : Is this what dancers wear on stage? I certainly hope you fired the costume designer for your last performance...
8491 : As a scholar, I'm assuming you know how to read. Ever tried opening a book about fashion...?
8492 : How are you going to harness the power of the lifestream if you can't even grasp the concept of not looking like chocobo excrement? You're a blight upon geomancers everywhere.
8493 : Having runes etched into your body doesn't put you above the laws of fashion, you know. Just remember, clothes make the adventurer, and not the other way around!
8494 : No, no, no! You can't walk around dressed like that! Not if I, Brygid, stylist extraordinaire, have anything to say about it! Now how can we get you back on track for this year's fashion...?
8495 : Let me see... For a person of your size and build, % and % should do the trick! Yes, I can see it now! You'll look marvelous!
8496 : You've already forgotten? <Sigh>... What would you people do without me? You need to find % and %!
8497 : Ah, I am a genius! You're beginning to look much better already. But I won't always be there to hold your hand, you know. You'll need to learn to dress yourself.
8498 : Let's see if any of my talent has rubbed off. Which of the following items do you think would look the best on you?
8499 : The fashion bug is itching... %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. I'm not sure...
8500 : The fashion bug is itching... %. %. %. %. %. Previous page. I need some more time...
8501 : Can't make up our minds, can we? Well, I suggest that we try thinking a little harder. We wouldn't want to keep a busy lady waiting now, would we?
8502 : Well, are you ready?
8503 : Wait a minute... Wearing something you already have is not the sign of a true fashion pioneer. You must have the courage to take chances! Don't tell me they didn't teach you that in adventuring school!
8504 : Hmph... Not bad... Not what I would have chosen, but not bad.
8505 : Would you like to try one on? If you want, I could give you mine...
8506 : What do you say? Where's the fitting room? Now that I think about it...
8507 : Changed your mind already? I know exactly how you feel. Becoming a fashion leader doesn't happen on spur-of-the-moment decisions.
8508 : I don't think your current job will allow you to equip that garment...
8509 : Do you still want to try it on? I know what I'm doing. I'll choose something else.
8510 : Alright! The piece is yours...after you've brought me %! What? Don't tell me you've never heard of %--they're all the rage!
8511 : I'll give you my % if you bring me a sparkly new %. But hurry up! Vana'diel's fashion trends change like the wind. I wouldn't want to be left behind!
8512 : The color... The shape... The aroma... This is exactly what I was looking for!
8513 : Here's the garment I promised you. Wear this, and you'll be the center of attention! I guarantee it!
8514 : Hey! You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right? Take this letter to that [cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?
8515 : Excuse me, [mister/lady]. Would you take this letter to the [guy/lady] in the red hat?
8516 : Adventurer-[man/lady]! Could you take this letter to that funny [guy/lady] in the red hat?
8517 : I would like to take this letter to a certain [fellow/woman] wearing a red chapeaux; however, my parents do not allow me to stray far from home. Kind adventurer, might you deliver it in my stead?
8518 : Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
8519 : Whoa! Thanks, [misterrr/lady]!
8520 : Thank you so very much, [sir/ma'am]!
8521 : Another present? Sorry, but I only have two hands, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!
8522 : Wow! Another present! Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?
8523 : Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent? You're starrrting to scare me, [mister/lady]...
8524 : I just accepted a gift from you, kind [sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.
8525 : ou've brought joy to the children of Vana'diel!
8526 : ou've brought barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel!
8527 : ##
8528 : Have you seen the trees? Have you seen the trees? It must be that time of the year again, kupo! Time for the Starlight Celebration, kupo!
8529 : I've even heard rumors that the craftsman that built the trees has crossed the eleven seas to work here in Bastok, kupo!
8530 : And if that's not enough, there's this strange character in a red hat that's been associating with the city's little people!
8531 : She said she was here to deliver presents, but if anything were to happen to Bastok's children... That's why I've been keeping an eye on the lady by pretending to help her and her underlings, kupo!
8532 : Speaking of children... There were a few kids that were looking for an adventurer to do a favor for them, kupo...
8533 : [None in the Mines District/One in the Mines District/Two in the Mines District/Three in the Mines District]... [None in the Markets/One in the Markets/Two in the Markets/Three in the Markets]... [None in Port Bastok/One in Port Bastok/Two in Port Bastok/Three in Port Bastok], and... [None in the Metalworks/One in the Metalworks/Two in the Metalworks/Three in the Metalworks]...
8534 : Why don't you try helping them out, kupo? But if I find out that you laid a stinking finger on any one of them...
8535 : (Ah! One of the strange hat-lady's underli--) Merry holidays, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer! It looks like you [haven't brought any joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been slacking off bringing joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing a tad bit of joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing a fair amount of joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing ridiculous amounts of joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing caravans loaded with ludicrous quantities of joy to the children of Vana'diel,] kupo!
8536 : Now, if you want, I could warp you to another nation so you could bother--I mean, bring joy to the wee ones there, kupo.
8537 : What do you say? I'm staying right here! Off to San d'Oria! Off to Bastok! Off to Windurst!
8538 : Bye
8539 : Hmph. It doesn't look like you've been bringing much holiday cheer, kupo... You can only obtain true joy by sending joy to others...or something like that, kupo!
8540 : Bastok's trees put all those other nations' trees to shame, kupo!
8541 : Bastok's trees are the best in Vana'diel because we use nothing but the best materials! Now take this and hurry back to the craftsman before he turns us both into firewood, kupo!
8542 : What are you waiting for, kupo!? Go go go!
8543 : Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?
8544 : Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!
8545 : You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.
8546 : This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.
8547 : But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!
8548 : It's just not fair, kupo!
8549 : Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!
8550 : And that's why we need your help, kupo! Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?
8551 : There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!
8552 : For starters, why don't you try finding %, %, and %? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!
8553 : Great! A whole set, kupo! Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole. Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!
8554 : If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo! We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!
8555 : Wow! Another set! You don't know how much this means to us, kupo! Here, take this!
8556 : You hand the clerk the % and # gil, and your set of armor is returned.
8557 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. Have you ever found yourself throwing away items because your Mog Safe is overflowing with dusty sets of armor collected on your many adventures? My colleagues and I have heard the cries of our fellow adventurers and joined together to aid all those in need.

8581 : Have you seen the decorations? The Doll Festival has started, kupo!
8582 : I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.
8583 : Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.
8584 : Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well? We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!
8585 : It looks like you have all the members you need. Time for the festival to begin, kupo!
8586 : After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival. Here, you take one as well, kupo!
8587 : It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!
8588 : In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!
8589 : As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, resourcefulness, I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!
8590 : Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress. Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!
8591 : And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor. I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!
8592 : Kupo!? Something's not right... Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!
8593 : Kupo... I know I said this was a girl's festival, but you need at least one guy to play the emperor, kupo.
8594 : You obtain % and %!
8595 : You obtain %, %, and %!
8596 : You obtain %, %, %, and %!
8597 : You obtain 3 %, 3 %, 3 %, and 3 %!
8598 : Kupo? What happened to your ten-person party? You can't trick presents out of me, kupo!
8599 : Ooh, a shiny new adventurer! Join in the fun, kupo!
8600 : You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day. Try again tomorrow, kupo!
8601 : Hey! Your party has different members all of a sudden! Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!
8602 : Hey! Your party has lost touch with its feminine side! You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!
8603 : Hmm... You seem to have lost your male element. Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!
8604 : #, # #, #
8605 : Anxious 1.
8606 : Anxious 2.
8607 : Assured.
8608 : Celestial Nights has begun, kupo!
8609 : An event based on the timeless, tear-jerking tale of tragedy between Prince Yahiko of the Eastern Nation and Princess Amdina of the Western Nation is being held, kupo!
8610 : In an interpretive recreation of the tale, two actors have assumed the roles of the prince and princess on a sizzling hot date!
8611 : But all is not well...
8612 : You see, the town is overflowing with alluringly attractive ladies, kupo.
8613 : Why is that such a bad thing, you ask? By distracting the prince from giving his undivided attention to the princess, these vivacious vixens could ruin the event, kupo.
8614 : That must not be allowed to happen! If the actor in the prince's role threatens towards fickleness, it's your duty to slap him back to reality--literally!
8615 : And we can't forget about the actress playing the princess, either. She's under a lot of pressure to perform, and is prone to being plagued with severe self-doubt about her feelings towards her co-star, kupo.
8616 : Only with your moral support could she hope to maintain confidence and perform at her brilliant best. A simple nod would go a long way to reaffirm positive thoughts, while a shake of the head would do wonders to cast out negative ones, kupo!
8617 : And going back to the scandalous seductresses I mentioned earlier, you can prevent them from disrupting this royal rendezvous by turning their attention to you. A wave of the hand should do the trick, kupo!
8618 : Whatever happens, you must ensure that the date--the event--goes smoothly! I pray for your success on this most meaningful of missions, kupo!
8619 : Princess Amdina, mine one and only! I have so longed to once more behold thee! Thou art even more beautiful than when last we met!
8620 : Thy words pleaseth me, my sweet prince.  I, too, have ached to be by thy side again.
8621 : Let us make this a reunion that shall never be forgotten! Shall we, my princess?
8622 : Yes, my prince!
8623 : Prince Yahiko, pray forgive me my boldness...but there is something I desire.
8624 : Thou needest but name it, and thine it shall be! There is naught I would deny thee, apple of mine eye.
8625 : <Blush>... Even if thy heart is what I desire, my prince?
8626 : Hahaha! My princess, mine heart has been thine since the day I first laid mine eyes upon thee.
8627 : Prince Yahiko, pray tell me true... I would know why thou dost love me so.
8628 : To answer thy question fully is to tell a tale grander than the greatest epics. Thy beautiful almond eyes that glimmer brighter than the most precious jewels...thy voice of honey that resoundeth more sweetly than angel song...
8629 : Thine entire being is as a soothing spring rain that hath come to nourish the arid desert of my lonely existence.
8630 : <Blush>... My...my prince...I know not what to say...
8631 : Prince Yahiko?
8632 : What is it, my precious?
8633 : <Blush>... It...it is nothing...
8634 : Sweet princess, thou needest not hide anything from me.
8635 : Oooh, that's a good man if I've ever seen one.
8636 : Yoohoo! Mister Prince! You got some time to spare? I'd appreciate the company of a good man like you.
8637 : A-and who dost thou assume to be?
8638 : (Is this shameless woman trying to seduce him!?)
8639 : Ahem! Thou art kind to offer, but as thou canst see, thy company is quite unnecessary!
8640 : My, aren't you feisty? Judging from your reaction, you've got a soft spot for him? Isn't that rich!
8641 : Well, Mister Prince? You coming or what?
8642 : Such charm...such confidence...
8643 : P-Prince Yahiko! Whither dost thou think...!
8644 : I-I must know thy name!
8645 : That's for me to know, and for you to find out.
8646 : I beseech thee, fair maiden!
8647 : Huh? What's wrong with me? I worked so hard to land the leading role for this event, but I almost threw it all away...
8648 : See you around, Mister Prince.
8649 : Princess Amdina! My beloved! Please, find it in thy heart to forgive this foolish prince!
8650 : Hmph! <Sigh>... I believed thou wouldst return to me, my prince.
8651 : Never again shall I leave thy side! This, I swear upon mine honor!
8652 : What?
8653 : Thanks for the attention, but I've got my eyes on Mister Prince over there. See you around!
8654 : Look, I don't have time to get all buddy-buddy with you, okay? Bye.
8655 : (I never imagined my co-star would be so handsome! <Sigh> I wish time would stand still...)
8656 : (Some day my prince will come...)
8657 : (I must have been out of my mind to wish for time to stand still. That's just plain selfish.)
8658 : (He must be really popular with the girls... I wonder what he thinks of me?)
8659 : (Oh, golly gosh! He's staring right at me! What do I do, what do I do!?)
8660 : (Oh wow, that girl over there is really well endo--what!? He's checking her out! How could he!?)
8661 : (Just walking beside him makes my heart beat like crazy! Have I finally mastered method acting? Or is this something...more?)
8662 : (This feeling...it's undeniable. I...I've fallen for him. Somebody, tell me what to do!)
8663 : (On second thought...maybe I'm just a bit run-down. That could also explain why my heart's racing like this.)
8664 : (My co-star...he's so kind, handsome, and intelligent... Perfect in every way!)
8665 : (The man of my dreams, right here in front of me! How could this be true?)
8666 : (What was I thinking? His being perfect is just an act. I can't believe I mixed up reality like that...)
8667 : (Aaah... How wonderful life would be if I had a boyfriend like him. But, do I deserve such happiness...?)
8668 : (But, of course I deserve to be happy! Everybody does!)
8669 : (Such happiness couldn't possibly last, and before long...)
8670 : (The same rehearsed lines over and over... This is getting boring. Couldn't he ad-lib or something?)
8671 : (What was I complaining about, I wonder? It doesn't matter at all that we're just trading lines. Being with him here is more than enough!)
8672 : (And I thought he was a good actor. How disappointing...)
8673 : (Maybe we're just not compatible with each other? If that's the case, there's nothing I can do...
8674 : (Why am I doubting myself like this? After all, even he complimented me on being perfect for the role, the princess reborn! I've got to be more confident!)
8675 : (It's only a matter of time before he starts hating me...)
8676 : (He sure does walk slowly. Shouldn't we be proceeding at a faster pace?)
8677 : (Why on Vana'diel did I ever complain about going too slow? The slower we walk, the longer I get to be with him!)
8678 : (Come on, come on, walk faster already! Grrr, I can't stand this guy!
8679 : (He hasn't said a word for ages now. Doesn't he like my company?)
8680 : (Oh, golly gosh, he's forgotten his lines! I better take the initiative and get us back on track...)
8681 : (I can't stand this silence anymore... Please, say something! Anything!)
8682 : (He sure is confident around women... Too confident...)
8683 : (Me and my overactive imagination... He's simply a gentleman who knows how to treat women. Nothing wrong with that.)
8684 : (He's just a despicable womanizer! He may be a good actor, but the disguise doesn't fool me!)
8685 : (Maybe it'd be better if I quit playing this role...)
8686 : Princess Amdina! Whither dost thou go?
8687 : What troubleth thee, my fair princess? Art thou feeling unwell?
8688 : (He...he really cares for me! Deep inside my heart, I knew it all along...)
8689 : It is nothing, my sweet prince, nothing at all. Now, let us resume our promenade!
8690 : Citizen, canst thou spare not the courtesy to allow the princess and I this rare private interlude?
8691 : There is not a single woman in the world who can rival the loveliness of my princess!
8692 : As long as I live, no harm shalt ever befall the princess. This, I swear upon mine honor!
8693 : I can bear not even the thought of life without Princess Amdina.
8694 : Only with Princess Amdina doth my existence hold meaning.
8695 : There is not a single moment where the thought of Princess Amdina doth not occupy my mind!
8696 : Citizen, canst thou not see that I am attending to...official business?
8697 : My perfect prince... <Sigh>
8698 : The prince concealeth behind his majestic facade an innocent, childlike aspect that hath awakened my maternal instincts.
8699 : I had always been skeptical towards the idea of destiny. And then I met Prince Yahiko...
8700 : Even when we are far apart, the mere thought of the prince bringeth a comforting warmth to my soul.
8701 : <Sigh> How I hope that one day he will maketh me his bride...
8702 : Only I hold the key which unlocketh his soul!
8703 : I beseech thee, loyal citizen! Deliver the prince back to mine arms!
8704 : Why, if it isn't my favorite adventurer! Hope you're having fun!
8705 : I...I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore. Please find someone else to play the role.
8706 : Wh-wh-what!?
8707 : Goodbye.
8708 : Hey, wait!
8709 : Nooo! Princess Amdina! Don't leave me!
8710 : Prince Yahiko, I shall never forget our reunion this day.
8711 : Nor I, my dear princess.
8712 : It is our fervent hope that thou hast thoroughly enjoyed the Celestial Nights event.
8713 : We present this gift to thee, as a token of our gratitude for thine unrelenting support.
8714 : This year's Sunbreeze Festival has begun! A special show is being held at the town square as we speak, kupo!
8715 : In this show, everybody's favorite frolicking fraulein, Mumor, goes head-to-head with a powerful minion of the irrepressibly evil demon king, Ullegore!
8716 : You, too, have a positively pivotal part to play in this classic battle between good and evil, kupo! Only with your boisterous backing can Mumor hope to claim victory over her determined opponent!
8717 : If all her fanatical fans' hearts were to beat as one, the tide of battle would surely turn in Mumor's favor, kupo!
8718 : Watch out for when Mumor prepares to unleash her ultimate attack, the Dancing Force! This is your cue to turn and face the demon king's minion, and dance like you've never danced before, kupo!
8719 : We'll be giving away a special prize to everyone who helps Mumor defeat her opponent, so give it your best, kupo!
8720 : And don't forget to check out the multifarious fun-filled festival games that've been set up in all three nations! Have fun, kupo!
8721 : I heard from Mumor that you helped her defeat the demon lord's minion! You have our heartfelt gratitude, kupo!
8722 : This is the prize we prepared for you. Come back and participate again anytime you want, kupo!
8723 : Wow! Your outstanding assistance makes you today's MVP, or most valuable participant!
8724 : Here is your prize as promised! Wearing it will earnestly enhance your festive mood, kupo!
8725 : This is the prize we prepared for you. Come back and participate again anytime you want, kupo!
8726 : Hello, faithful fans! Mighty Maiden Mumor here!
8727 : I want you all to know how special you make me feel by coming out to listen to one of our little ditties!
8728 : Right, Uka? Uka? Leaping lizards, where could she have run off to?
8729 : Mwahahahaha!
8730 : Who's there!?
8731 : Ah, Mumor. How many years has it been?
8732 : Cinnamon and gravy, it's Ullegore! I won't let you wipe the smiles off my adoring fans' faces!
8733 : Oho, but wipe I will! Uka, come!
8734 : I am herrre, Lord Ullegore.
8735 : N-no!
8736 : Snap this little twig in two.
8737 : By your command.
8738 : Uka...? What's wrong? Why, after all we've been through?
8739 : We're not friends, Mumor. We never were. I exist only to serve his eminence, Lord Ullegore.
8740 : Eeep!
8741 : Stand strong! Believe in the bonds between you and your prancing partner!
8742 : Diva!
8743 : Ullegore underhandedly usurped Uka's will with wicked wizardry! So stop staring and samba her back to her senses!
8744 : And now you turn your back on me, Diva. Very well. I shall sip your tears tonight as well!
8745 : W-wait... Why am I supporting such a second-rate starlet?
8746 : Well, I positively planted my paw in it. No going back now! Go get 'em, girl!
8747 : Don't let Ullegore frazzle you, Uka! I'll bounce those cobwebs right out of your head!
8748 : C'mon, everyone! Let's show Ullegore the true meaning of dance!
8749 : Grk...
8750 : Keep at it!
8751 : Thanks to all your help, I'm beginning to feel tingly and sparkly! Here we go, my lovelies!
8752 : Neo Crystal Jig!!!
8753 : Super Crusher Jig!!!
8754 : Shining Summer Samba!!!
8755 : Lovely Miracle Waltz!!!
8756 : Urgh... It's my turrrn, now!
8757 : Ouchies!
8758 : Please, I need your help!
8759 : Uka...why? Why don't you remember me?
8760 : Mumor!
8761 : Mwahahaha! And so ends the story of the Mighty Maidens--with not a bang, but a whimper!
8762 : Never shall any in this land know fun again!
8763 : Noooooo...!
8764 : And so it came to pass that Mumor was vanquished by her archnemesis and an unending doldrum blanketed land and sea alike.
8765 : The only way this most terrible of fates can be reversed is by lending Mumor strength and spirit, that she may rise once more!
8766 : M-Mumor? What...happened?
8767 : Impossible!
8768 : Uka! You had the butterflies doing laps around my stomach!
8769 : Curse you, Mumor! I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for you meddling spectators!
8770 : But don't rest on your laurels just yet!
8771 : He's...he's a person!?
8772 : Countless eons have I flitted from star to star, bringing to each the sweet embrace of boredom.
8773 : But this clamorous world you call Vana'diel refuses to receive my gift.
8774 : Fine. I can still wrap this world in lethargy and ennui, and neither you, Diva, or Uka can stop me!
8775 : No! As long as there are light and smiles in this world, I will rise up to stop you!
8776 : That's our cue, everyone--Firesday Night Fever time!
8777 : Pardon me for breaking the fourth wall, but perhaps an explanation is in order.
8778 : Firesday Night Fever describes the special moments in a songstress's career when she is so intimately connected to her fan base that she can activate her Dancing Force without the need of any outward shows of support!
8779 : Hmph. You two are pathetic.
8780 : Goodbye, Ullegore, you've had a nice run!
8781 : But the Maidens are here, bringing Vana'diel fun!
8782 : The time has arrived to give the dark lord his due!
8783 : And so, evil spirits, I have this to say: pooh-pooh!
8784 : Wh-what is the meaning of--!
8785 : Now's our chance, Mumor!
8786 : To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
8787 : We'll dance to the abyss and back!
8788 : Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!
8789 : Eternal Vana Illusion!!!
8790 : Graaaaaaaaah!!!
8791 : We surrre gave him his comeuppance!
8792 : H-how could I...?
8793 : Wow, you're way worse at winning than I am!
8794 : You want me to leave your precious festival alone? Fine. I acquiesce.
8795 : Really? 'Cause if you break your promise, it'll be a thousand pricklies for you.
8796 : One thousand, ten thousand...bah, who can keep count?
8797 : C'mon, Mumor! Give him ten thousand right in the kisser!
8798 : Listen, guys! He hasn't broken his promise yet!
8799 : You are a curious one, Mumor. Most would relish in their victory and rub the loser's nose in it...but not you.
8800 : Though I have lost, I do not feel any ill will. Is this what fun is?
8801 : Okay, everyone! We've brought peace and happiness back to Vana'diel, so now it's time...I'm finally going to sing!
8802 : M-M-Mumor! D-d-don't!
8803 : Tra laaa laaaaaa...!!!
8804 : Hm? Why isn't everyone cheering?
8805 : M-Mumor...I told you...not to...
8806 : This whole time...you were tone-deaf...
8807 : No...my number-one nemesis...all along was...some squawking sham!?
8808 : Oh come now, everyone! You're giving me a bad case of the uglies!
8809 : My darling festivalgoers, you brought a spring back to Uka's step and a tear to my eye! I love you...each and every one of you!
8810 : Why, without you, Ullegore would be running rampant across the land!
8811 : Next time I'll have a super-sweet melody prepared, so keep those ears open and wait with bated breath!
8812 : But for now...enjoy the festival!
8813 : Mumor and %'s dancing synchronized! [You are overflowing with trust!/Your camaraderie lights up the sky!/Your friendship will go down in history!]
8814 : Mumor and %'s dancing synchronized[/ a good deal/ exceptionally well/ to the utmost degree of perfection]!
8815 : % is spurred on by the fireworks you bought! Your cheering will now be even more potent!
8816 : ShowStep: #
8817 : Switch[OFF/ON]
8818 : Reignite the spark in your life with some fantastic fireworks, lovingly crafted by the always-lovely Mighty Maidens!
8819 : Come one, come all! Get your hands on the Mighty Maidens' new line of cheer-boosting, crowd-pleasing fireworks. They're grrreat fun for the whole family!
8820 : Thank you so much for patronizing our humble establishment! Note that the more fireworks you buy, the better the Mighty Maidens will perform against Ullegore and his minions! At this rate, they will perform like [tone-deaf Tonberries./over-hyped amateurs./fan favorites./superstars!/cultural icons!] Remember, your compassionate consumerism is key to restoring fun and felicity to the realm.
8821 : Kupopo... Mumor's woeful one-woman wail split my skull in six!
8822 : Oh dear. I knew I shouldn't have tried to hit that high note...
8823 : M-Mumor! Don't worry! It's...nothing that practice couldn't fix, kupo.
8824 : You don't have to butter me up. I know that my vocal cards aren't cut out for it. But heavens, what good is an idol who can't sing?
8825 : How do you respond? Different strokes for different folks! Hey, you've got the looks!
8826 : That's sweet as sugar of you to say. I promise I'll work really, really hard for next year!
8827 : Well, that's another shade of white! I didn't use Daddy's wand, so why...?
8828 : Well done, my dear. Well done.
8829 : Daddy!
8830 : Your spirit and emotions were dazzling, and your adoring fans were with you every step of the way. If anyone is worthy of being called an idol, it's you.
8831 : Do you really think I'm worthy? But...my singing...
8832 : Being an idol isn't only about singing and dancing.
8833 : It's about winning the hearts of your fans and having them support you through thick and thin.
8834 : I raised you to be an idol so that one day you might save the world. A father could be no prouder of his daughter.
8835 : Oh, Daddy...
8836 : My fine [lad/young woman], your support of Mumor throughout the years has meant the world to me.
8837 : This I promise--as dedicated as her fans are to her, she is twice as dedicated to them.
8838 : And it's thanks to you that I've shaken off the heebie-jeebies and am ready to face a new day!
8839 : I have a special place in my heart for each and every one of my fans--but especially you!
8840 : I've been waiting for you, kupo! Mumor, the shining starlet herself, has slunk her way onto the streets to see you!
8841 : I'm so glad you're here! With all my singing and battling, I never seem to find the time to meet my wonderful fans!
8842 : I was positively tickled to see you in the crowd. Can I ask your name?
8843 : %, your dancing was positively peachy!
8844 : Remember how Diva called forth another me?
8845 : You can surely do the same thing, too.
8846 : I can feel it in the way you lend Uka and me strength.
8847 : After all, it must mean we have those three special bonds...
8848 : Could you give it a try? Just for me?
8849 : To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
8850 : Psst! That's your cue!
8851 : You mean you don't know how to finish off the catchphrase? Well, Uka's not here, so I'll have to think of a separate one for you...
8852 : ...We'll sing and twist until the sun shines through!
8853 : Yes, that's perfect!
8854 : Wow! It's like I came up with it myself!
8855 : Now we can be together all year round, not just at the Sunbreeze Festival!
8856 : / But as friends, not as performer and fan. I've got to keep my voice pristine for next year!
8857 : A revival of Mumor's final performance will soon be underway.
8858 : As always, your steadfast support can greatly affect the outcome of this magnificent show. Let me tell you how.
8859 : Like any good diva, Mumor requires the cheers of her fans to unlock her true potential in the struggles that lie ahead. In short, your emotions are her strength.
8860 : /clapping, /cheering, and /waving all have a positive affect on her, and switching between them has a greater effect than repeating the same one over and over.
8861 : When Mumor has received enough accolades from her fans, she will unleash one of her powerful dance moves. When she does, dance along with her!
8862 : Her dances include the following:
8863 : Shining Summer Samba: /dance1 Lovely Miracle Waltz: /dance2
8864 : Neo Crystal Jig: /dance3 Super Crusher Jig: /dance4
8865 : That should cover it.
8866 : Dancing the proper steps in sync with Mumor will strengthen the bond between the two of you.
8867 : So unite as one to give Mumor the energy she so desperately needs!
8868 : We will also be selling a variety of festival goods throughout the event. The more you buy, the happier Mumor becomes, so do your idol proud!
8869 : That does it for the explanation of our event. I hope you enjoy the show!
8870 : What has brought you to our fine guild today, [sir/madame]? Wait... That scroll! Would you mind if I had a closer look?
8871 : The craftsmanship is so beautiful...yet so familiar...
8872 : Hm... While there is no sign of the original goldsmith's signature, I think I may know who originally crafted this fine piece.
8873 : Here, have a look at this diary. Beautiful, isn't it?
8874 : Can you see the similarities in the book's jade lock and the scroll's decorated fastener?
8875 : But that's not all. The handwriting in both the diary and the scroll are the same... Look here, I've found a name...
8876 : Albanus. Let us see what our craftsman had to say...
8877 : Symmetrical, yet elegant design... Intricate, yet delicate craftsmanship...
8878 : And an alloy with the 'voice' of an angel.
8879 : Only when these three hurdles are cleared will the perfect bell be born.
8880 : Ah, but just thinking of the day I finally reach my goal ties my stomach in knots.
8881 : There is still so much I must learn before I am able to step out on my own. I must continue to concentrate on the road that lies ahead.
8882 : However, my studies keep me so busy, I have not even finished cleaning out the small room the guildmaster was kind enough to lend me. Though I do not know how much longer I can stand sleeping amongst rusty buckets and moldy cobwebs.
8883 : And so on and so on...
8884 : If you ask me, this young fellow seems a little too high-strung. While I have nothing against studying hard to improve one's skills, state of mind has a lot to do with how a work turns out.
8885 : A great painter once said art is ninety percent inspiration and ten percent perspiration--meaning the more you perspire, the more sweat you get on your painting... And no one likes a sweaty picture.
8886 : Are you following me?
8887 : Anyway, you said you were looking for clues to repair a damaged bell. While I have not had much experience building such large objects, I do know someone who does.
8888 : You have been to the Blacksmiths' Guild in San d'Oria, haven't you? Well, did you know that the guildmaster there forged the bells that hang in the San d'Orian Cathedral?
8889 : Now, whether or not he will help you, I cannot say.
8890 : Those Elvaan are a stubborn lot, and old Mevreauche is the worst I know.
8891 : Hopefully you can catch him on one of his good days, if he has any...
8892 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!
8893 : We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
8894 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders! Behold the wondrous %, kupo!
8895 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.
8896 : But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!
8897 : Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
8898 : The % will absorb a part of the villain's aura every time you attack, kupo.
8899 : Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!
8900 : By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor. They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!
8901 : Here's a new %. Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!
8902 : If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
8903 : Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!
8904 : I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy! Here's your reward, kupo!
8905 : With all the aura you've absorbed with the %, we've managed to create a new weapon. We'd like you to have it, kupo!
8906 : Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!
8907 : We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!
8908 : Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!
8909 : But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!
8910 : If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho.
8911 : Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo! Just take care, and good luck, kupo!
8912 : It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!
8913 : We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!
8914 : We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?
8915 : Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!
8916 : There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.
8917 : You'll help us out, kupo?
8918 : Help the moogles? I'll give it a try. I have other things to do.
8919 : Oh, I just remembered! I think that the cards are all addressed to people who are wearing red...
8920 : Good luck!
8921 : If you change your mind, just let me know, kupo.
8922 : This card is addressed to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, kupo!
8923 : This card is addressed to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, kupo!
8924 : I've been waiting! I've got a present for you, kupo!
8925 : I have a request, too. I've got presents for all the other adventurers, too, but I can't find everyone. I need your help, kupo!
8926 : I need you to give this card to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, and have them bring it back to me, kupo!
8927 : Oh, and the person should be wearing the same red clothing you are!
8928 : I'll wait here and get the present ready! Thanks, kupo!
8929 : Did you hand out the % yet, kupo? If you forgot who to give it to, just bring it to a moogle and you'll get a reminder.
8930 : You forgot who to give the % to? Find a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s and hand it over, kupo!
8931 : You can only hand out one card a day, kupo!
8932 : What in blazes could he be doing? He shoulda been here by now! No reason to wait! I don't bite!
8933 : It's about time you brought my painting! Show it to me!
8934 : Oh, but what's the hurry? I've just arrived. Don't you want to sit back and relax a spell first? Take a deep breath, stretch out, maybe grab a few sips of tea...
8935 : I don't know what kinda inane ideas they're feeding you young'uns today, but when I order a painting, I expect it to come on time, not three days late!
8936 : Or maybe you just don't have it! If that's the case...just let me crack my knuckles first...
8937 : Okay! Okay! Here, I'll give it to you, so calm down. It goes without saying that you'll take good care of it, right?
8938 : Yeah, whatever. Hurry up and give it to me! Young'uns nowadays. No respect.
8939 : Eh? This is pretty secure packaging... I can't open this, you hear me!?
8940 : Oh, no no no no no! You mustn't move with such vigor! How about we take a nice, deep breath first, and then talk about it, okay?
8941 : You mean to tell me the paint isn't dry yet?
8942 : After you make me wait three days, you deliver me an unfinished product! You little...! What, you think we old people just sit around knitting, hoping you'll make time for us someday!?
8943 : Mister, I assure you, this painting is a delicate masterpiece. It would be a catastrophe to disturb it before it has fully dried! The humidity and temperature must be just right to ensure maximum quality!
8944 : At least that's what % says here, and [his/her] word is trustworthy. Why, [he's/she's] a professional artist [himself/herself]!
8945 : [He/She] looks like an adventurer? Ha, you've got to be kidding me! I mean, if you look at [him/her] just so, [he/she] could possibly look like an actual...that is, you shouldn't judge by appearances!
8946 : Anyway, our expert here says that opening the box now would have a negative effect on the painting.
8947 : You must be patient until % gives the word!
8948 : You wouldn't want your hastiness ruining this beautiful painting, would you?
8949 : Well, I guess I've got no choice now, do I? Since I've already waited three days, I guess I can wait a mite longer. I'll let it go this time. But don't think you're getting off scot-free.
8950 : Until this thing dries, you're gonna help me out.
8951 : The other day, I lost my %. It's a memento of my deceased wife, you see.
8952 : You are gonna go look for another one. You wouldn't turn down a kind old man now, would you!?
8953 : Oh, come on!
8954 : First you make me wait in agony, and then you won't even listen to a single plea for the memory of my poor dead wife! What kind of a monster are you? I don't do business with monsters!
8955 : W-wait! You really think we wouldn't do a favor or two for a valued customer such as yourself? How could he think you wouldn't help him, %?
8956 : Just promise me that you won't open that box. % said not to!
8957 : Yeah yeah, shaddup. Just go!
8958 : All right! We really pulled the wool over his eyes. Step one, clear!
8959 : Even he wouldn't dare open that box after all we ground him about it!
8960 : Now all we can do is hope that your friend is doing as well with Angelica...
8961 : What's that noise?
8962 : You can communicate with your partner through that? This is fantastic! So, how are things coming along in Windurst?
8963 : She'll redo the painting!? Terrific! Quite a friend you've got there, I'd say! Well, we'll just have to do our best to earn time now!
8964 : I just wish that old man didn't ask for something so bizarre.
8965 : He wanted a %, right?
8966 : I used to stock them a while back. My supplier said he got them in Korroloka Tunnel.
8967 : I hate to say it, but I've got an appointment awaiting me in Selbina.
8968 : So I'll just leave the search for the % to you!
8969 : Hey hey, don't look at me that way, now. You're the only one I can count on! Please find the % for me!
8970 : It was such a shock, losing the % that my poor wife kept when she was alive...
8971 : Please find it for me, young'un!
8972 : Th-this is...! You really found the %!
8973 : I'm so happy. I've waited so long for this moment!
8974 : The painting I ordered is actually a portrait of my poor, departed wife.
8975 : She was a fine lass, she was. Much too fine for a man like me.
8976 : Long ago, I gave her the % that you found for me.
8977 : Those times are long gone, but she and I used to go to the beach and hunt for % together.
8978 : I gave a pretty one to her without much thought, simply 'cause I thought it looked nice. But she was so happy, she made it into a pendant, saying she wanted to keep it forever.
8979 : She wore it every day until she died...
8980 : I kept thinking I wanted to get her a nicer present, but she insisted that the % was the perfect gift.
8981 : It was the first and the last present I ever gave her.
8982 : My wife was an artist. She loved painting so much, she brought her canvas everywhere with her.
8983 : She often used me as the model for her works. I was embarrassed and kept trying to refuse, but she was persistent.
8984 : She always put a lot of emphasis on color. She used to travel the world looking for proper paints.
8985 : The shade she was most proud of recreating was the color of the % that I gave her. Colors change with varying degrees of light, you know, and can be difficult to reproduce.
8986 : She treasured her secret recipe greatly.
8987 : It's amazing how a home can become so lonely with the loss of a single person.
8988 : Before my memories start to fade, I want to bring together all I remember about my wife.
8989 : That's why I ordered her portrait.
8990 : Ah, I've said too much.
8991 : Could you...leave me alone for a bit?
8992 : You actually got that crank to talk to you? It sounds like he really loved his wife.
8993 : Now I definitely can't tell him I lost his portrait! I wonder how the redo is coming along...
8994 : Hm, looks like it'll take some time, eh? Well, that's too bad.
8995 : I just got a message from Selbina, and I've got to go back to deal with an important matter.
8996 : It's probably best if you just leave the old man alone for a while.
8997 : Anyway, I'll be on my way now. Meet me in Selbina when you're done here.
8998 : Sorry, but could you leave me alone for a while?
8999 : You're both safe! You had me worried!
9000 : Maybe you've already heard, but I found the original painting. I just delivered it to the old man.
9001 : Man, it's rough doing things on my own! He caught me trying to sneak in the painting before I had time to blink.
9002 : What do you think you were doing, trying to trick a poor old man? Can't help yourself 'cause you got attacked by big bad pirates? Don't be surprised if you find yourself in deep, and real soon!
9003 : You, however, have my utmost thanks. You were the one who went looking for my memento, weren't you?
9004 : I didn't think you'd really do it. Sorry for all the trouble.
9005 : Looking at this reminds me of the happy life I had with my wife.
9006 : I closed off my heart when she died.
9007 : I built a wall around myself, thinking that no one could understand my pain.
9008 : Of course, people stopped coming to see me as a result...
9009 : But I didn't really want to be alone.
9010 : I yearned for some kind of vestige of my wife, so I ordered her portrait.
9011 : It just made me realize how important she is in my life.
9012 : She's always been here, supporting me when I need it.
9013 : I don't need the painting.
9014 : She can't rest in peace while I'm still chasing after her memory.
9015 : You have my thanks. It was dangerous out there, wasn't it? Sorry for everything.
9016 : Th-this picture...! It...it's my wife, in the flesh!
9017 : A-and the coloring! My wife's secret recipe!
9018 : This is just what I've been looking for! Please, give this portrait to me! Please, I beg you!
9019 : Of course. % and I worked hard to get it for you, after all.
9020 : Take it! % and I worked our hides off to get this to you!
9021 : It's yours. This is what % and I have worked for, after all.
9022 : % and I always intended it for you. It belongs to you.
9023 : Of course! That's why % and me brought it here!
9024 : Hey, there's no need to beg. % and I intended to give it to you.
9025 : Of course. % and I worked hard to get it to you.
9026 : Yeah, of course! % and I got it for you, after all!
9027 : It's yours. % and I intended it for you from the beginning, anyway.
9028 : Yeah, of course! % and I worked so hard to get it for you!
9029 : % and I always intended it for you. It belongs to you.
9030 : This portrait isn't for % and I to give. It belongs to you.
9031 : The most important thing is that you're happy, anyway.
9032 : Really!? It's like a dream!
9033 : Ah, I suppose I shouldn't get so excited. Bad for the heart, they say.
9034 : A lot of people reached out to me after my wife's death. I wonder how those people are doing now...
9035 : Maybe I should even apologize for my attitude then...
9036 : With this painting, you have helped me realize what I'm truly missing.
9037 : Thanks for everything.
9038 : My wife has left me with a great many things, tangible and otherwise...
9039 : I'll never forget the time we spent together.
9040 : You lost my painting? That's, like, really uncool, you know.
9041 : Could it have been the one that guy Umberto, or whatever, wanted?
9042 : Anyway, spill the facts, 'kay?
9043 : Oh my Goddess! Attacked by pirates? That's, like, so terrifically terrible!
9044 : And the painting was lost in all the, like, confusion and stuff, right?
9045 : And you came here under the request of some guy named Diederik to ask me to redo it?
9046 : And he's, like, bringing the fuddy-duddy an empty box instead?
9047 : Wow, that's, like, so bold! I wonder if he can pull it off!
9048 : Anyway, I totally understand your situation now. I'll redo the painting.
9049 : This is a test of my brilliance as a painter. I accept!
9050 : Now that I think about it, the original was total chocobo fodder anyway. I can, like, do so much better than that!
9051 : So he wanted me to paint his dead wife or something, yeah? Diederik gave me a portrait as a reference, but...
9052 : ...It's totally wrong! There's, like, no wifeliness in it at all!
9053 : This is sooo lame! There's, like, gotta be something else, you know?
9054 : Whoa, I just heard a sound, for real!
9055 : You can talk to your friend that way? That's uber-neato!
9056 : So did you get the lowdown on how I should paint my next masterpiece?
9057 : So he had this % thing as her memento? ...Oh, it's coming! I'm, like, getting an image!
9058 : Oh, ohhh... Quick, go to Korroloka Tunnel and get me that % so I can paint before I lose the image!
9059 : The %! This is the old man's memento of his wife, right?
9060 : Oh, ohhh... I'm getting something! I'm getting that hazily vague iiimaaage!
9061 : Hey, I've seen this before!
9062 : Yeah, it was totally in Bastok!
9063 : I used to be in Bastok, and all, and there was this lady who used to wear this % as, like, a pendant, or something.
9064 : She was a painter, and she used to paint pictures of her husband whenever they had a day off.
9065 : It was true marital bliss. Her man was an edgy little guy, but she was totally, like, laid-back and all. I think she soothed him.
9066 : Of course, her paintings lacked the energy and passion of my work, but they were pretty nice in a sedated kind of way, if you're into that kind of thing.
9067 : But she was, like, the bomb at using color!
9068 : I could just sit there all day and stare at her paints. They were right on!
9069 : What kind of color should I use for her? I just want to use one, but the color I use has to like, change intricately, delicately, depending on how you look at it, like the %...
9070 : ......!
9071 : Hold it right there! Could this be!? Oh my Goddess, this is perfect! The woman in the reference portrait and the woman in Bastok!
9072 : They're one and the same!? Could it be true?
9073 : Now my portrait will be absolute perfection!
9074 : Oh yeah, but, like, as long as I've come this far, I might as well get the paints right and do her justice, you know?
9075 : I could swear she went into some castle swarming with Yagudo to get an % to use in mixing her paint, but I don't remember exactly where.
9076 : Anyway, go and get the %, 'kay? Hurry up, or I'll lose the image!
9077 : Your adventuring fellow's level limit is now 55.
9078 : If you want to thank someone, thank %. I couldn't have done it without [him/her].
9079 : You should be thanking %! Couldn't have done it without [him/her]!
9080 : You should thank %. I couldn't have done it without [him/her].
9081 : % deserves your gratitude most. I could not have done it without [him/her].
9082 : Don't thank me, thank %. I couldn't have done it without [his/her] help.
9083 : Most of the credit goes to %. It wouldn't have been possible without [his/her] help.
9084 : If you want to thank someone, thank %! I couldn't have done it without [him/her].
9085 : You should be thanking %! I couldn't have done it without [him/her]!
9086 : You should thank %. I couldn't have done it without [him/her].
9087 : You should thank %! I could only do it because of [him/her]!
9088 : % deserves your gratitude most. I could not have done it without [him/her].
9089 : You should direct your gratitude at %. [His/Her] cooperation made it possible.
9090 : Hopefully, I can be more of a help to [him/her] from now on.
9091 : From now on, I'm going to be more of a help to [him/her]!
9092 : I'll try to help more from now on, though...
9093 : From this day forward, I will strive to be more of a help to [him/her].
9094 : From now on, I'll try harder so % won't have to work so hard.
9095 : From now on, I'm gonna to do whatever I can to be a better help to %.
9096 : Hopefully, I can be more of a help from now on!
9097 : I want to help % out more from now on!
9098 : I will try to be more of a help from now on.
9099 : I'm gonna try to be more helpful from now on, though!
9100 : From this day forward, I will strive to be more of a help to [him/her].
9101 : From next time, I will do more to lessen %'s burden.
9102 : Sometimes it just plain hurts when I realize I'll never be able to talk to my wife again.
9103 : You should appreciate your friends' company while they're still around.
9104 : What!? I don't feel like talking, so leave me alone!
9105 : Love is in the air! It's time for Valentione's Day celebrations, kupo!
9106 : There is an amazing type of chocolate whose filling is influenced by your feelings! When chocolate halves from a boy and a girl are matched together, the resulting whole produces a wonderful taste if the couple is meant to be, kupo!
9107 : Young men and women in this town have broken their chocolates in two, hoping to meet that special someone!
9108 : We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!
9109 : Here's what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.
9110 : There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!
9111 : When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.
9112 : You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.
9113 : Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.
9114 : When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.
9115 : If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!
9116 : Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo.
9117 : We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!
9118 : Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!
9119 : After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!
9120 : While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho!
9121 : Or maybe you could take advantage of this romantic occasion and make a party with that special someone while you exchange chocolates, kupopopo!
9122 : Want to try again? Match up all the lovebirds you can, kupo!
9123 : Something wrong, kupo?
9124 : Something wrong? Listen to the rules again. Give up. Not really.
9125 : Four people hold the chocolates you seek. Make them into four whole chocolates and give one to each person. When you're finished, return to a moogle, kupo!
9126 : You aren't planning on giving up, are you?
9127 : Quit the game? Yes. Not yet.
9128 : If you want to start over, you'll have to get rid of the chocolates you have now.
9129 : Really give up? Yes! No, not yet!
9130 : Just think of all those poor singles! You'll come back and help them later, won't you, kupo? You should get rid of your chocolates in a subtle manner, so that you don't hurt anyone's feelings! ...We wouldn't want you getting a stomachache either, now would we, kupo?
9131 : You've managed to gather complementary pieces of chocolate! Wait just a moment, now...
9132 : ...
9133 : Kupopopo! What a beautiful piece of chocolate! No need to thank me, now. Hurry and give it to the Valentione Single!
9134 : Great work, kupo! You delivered chocolates to everyone! I've been getting lots of feedback about it! The response has been...
9135 : Excellent! I thought my heart was going to flutter out of my furry little chest--you score # [point/points]! The power of love is amazing, kupo!
9136 : Decent. You score # [point/points]. Everyone seems relatively happy! Not bad, kupo.
9137 : Well, let's just say that some things just weren't meant to be. You score # [point/points]. Sorry, but I won't hand out a reward this time, kupo.
9138 : My bag is filled with goodies for helpful adventurers like yourself! Take your pick!
9139 : Which item would you like? Let me think. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
9140 : Are you absolutely sure, kupo?
9141 : You really want %? Yes, that's the one! On second thought...
9142 : You must wait a bit longer to try again, kupo.
9143 : You have to throw away all of your chocolates before playing again, kupo! It might seem a waste, but a rule is a rule!
9144 : Oh, I've been waiting for this moment! You'll help me find my perfect woman, right? Wow, thank you!!!
9145 : I really like [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! They're fantastic! Here's a piece of chocolate. I hope you bring back the best chocolate ever! Good luck!
9146 : You still haven't brought any chocolate? I've been waiting so long for this, so hurry up!
9147 : Hey, what do you want? You could go see a moogle or something!
9148 : <gasp>! Y-you brought me a chocolate! I'm going to savor its delicate flavor...and then I'll let you know what I think! Thank you!
9149 : Hey. I heard you're playing the matchmaker around here.
9150 : Hmph, guess I might as well let you know my type. I like [Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra], and I like 'em [cheerful/kind/shy/modest]. I leave this chocolate, and my future, in your hands. Well, go on. Get on with it.
9151 : What? Still...? Oh well, keep it up. Looking forward to the results.
9152 : What do you want? I don't think I know you.
9153 : Well, you were able to get a finished chocolate after all. I need some time to think, though. After all, this could determine my future, so I will taste it later. Thank you.
9154 : I have been waiting all my life for this! You'll match me up with a girl, right? Wow! Me and a girl, together! Imagine!
9155 : Oh, oh, let's see...I'll tell you exactly what I want! I want a [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! She also must cook things like steamed catfish every night, love watching Ballista, and have an interest in airship mechanics...er, ignore those last few requests. Anyway, here's some chocolate! Go get me a woman!
9156 : Oh wow, thanks for doing this for me! I can't wait for my chocolate!
9157 : What? What do you need? Nothing? Okay, then!
9158 : Wooow, you really got a chocolate for me! I'll let you know how it tastes later! Oh, thank you, thank you! I hope you can get a real, live [girlfriend/boyfriend] someday, too!
9159 : N-no way! I can meet...a woman? One that...likes me!? ...Oh, wow!
9160 : Okay, okay...I'm going to tell you my type. Let's see...I'd like an, um...ack, this is so embarrassing. I'd like a [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! Y-yes, that's my order! (Oops...maybe I went too far just now...) Anyway, h-here's a chocolate!
9161 : Ahhh! By Altana, you scared me! Not finished yet? O-oh, I'm sorry!
9162 : What!? ...Oh, you want something? I-I'm fine!
9163 : Ahhh! You really got a chocolate for me! B-but, I don't see anywhere I could eat it now! I'll have to tell the moogle what I think later. Wow, this is great! See ya!
9164 : Hiya! I've been waiting for you, sugar! Going to find a real sweetheart for me, are you? Yay!
9165 : Listen closely, now! I liiike...[cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boys! Teeheehee! Here's a chocolate! Doesn't it look yummy? Good luck!
9166 : What's wrong, pumpernickel? Not having trouble, are we? I really want a man, so please hurry up!
9167 : Hm? Want something? You should go talk to a moogle!
9168 : Oh, I've been waiting! I wonder what it tastes like! I'll let you know what I think later. Thank you so much!
9169 : Why, hello! This looks like quite an exciting event, doesn't it? I hope I can also meet a nice guy.
9170 : [Cheerful/Cool-headed/Honest/Shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] guys are just my type. Here's a chocolate. You have my support! I wish you the best of luck!
9171 : Hello! You seem to be working very hard. I'm really thankful! But you needn't rush around so fast. Take your time! I can wait if it makes the job easier for you!
9172 : Yes? You have a question? Oh, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong person, but don't worry about it!
9173 : Wow, you brought back a finished chocolate! Thank you so much! I wonder what it tastes like. Teeheehee, I can't wait to try it. I hope you meet someone special, too!
9174 : Aaah! Oh...hi! Um, today is...and I...well, that is... <sigh> I can't bring myself to say it!
9175 : Well, here goes nothing. I want [a cheerful/a cool-headed/an honest/a shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boyfriend! A-and here's a chocolate... Th-thank you! (I can't believe I just said that!)
9176 : Eep! Oh, y-you haven't brought a chocolate back yet? You really scared me, you know! Anyway, good luck!
9177 : Y-yes? What is it? I...um, I don't need anything...
9178 : What? Th-this...could it be? You got me a chocolate! I can't eat it here, though...that would be sooo embarrassing. But I will eat it later, so thank you!
9179 : Hello... I may not look like much, but I do hope to meet a nice guy...
9180 : I really like [cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] men. Please take this chocolate. It may not be the best in the world, but I hope you can use it to find someone.
9181 : You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you? I knew it would be hard to find someone for a girl like me...
9182 : What's the matter? I don't think there's anything I need...
9183 : I see you got a chocolate for me. I can't tell how good it will be until I taste it, but maybe there's hope for me after all. Thanks so much for helping me.
9184 : %'s badge flashes brightly.
9185 : I say! That's a mighty lustrous... Ah, it is not a gem. Pity.
9186 : I take great pride in my collection of precious gems, but I suspect that there are types I have never even seen before buried in the lands of the Near East.
9187 : My dad says that you can do anything as long as you have the money to pay for it!
9188 : But I don't know how to get any money...
9189 : My family's rich, so I don't have to worry about it, but I bet you could make some as a mercenary! Check it out!
9190 : Arawn's badge flashes brightly.
9191 : What's this? Is that a Salaheem's Sentinel badge from Aht Urhgan you've got there?
9192 : This is quite an exquisite piece of craftsmanship. I have heard that Aht Urhgan is as technologically advanced as Bastok--a very curious place, indeed.
9193 : Oh, that's the badge the mercenary company is handing out to interest people in their organization, isn't it?
9194 : The rumors I've been hearing about Aht Urhgan aren't very pleasant. I'd keep my distance if I were you.
9195 : Maybe being a mercenary is more up my alley than the military academy...
9196 : Wipe that thought from your mind this instant! It gives me goosebumps just thinking about the kind of dangerous places those types venture into! Don't you even try to tell me you'd trade your life in for a bit of gil!
9197 : Oh, come on! I can take care of myself! You're too much, Sis!
9198 : Come and celebrate the Doll Festival with us, kupo!
9199 : We've got items for everyone! Here you go, kupo!
9200 : Come again and bring your friends! Each of them will also get an item, kupo!
9201 : You can get items only once each day, so come back again tomorrow, kupo!
9202 : You obtain # ), # ), # ), and # )!
9203 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!
9204 : The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
9205 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans! Behold the wondrous %, kupo!
9206 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
9207 : But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!
9208 : Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
9209 : If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
9210 : Kupopo! The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!
9211 : And this time, it's called Azimuth Circle...II!
9212 : Would you like to know more, kupo?
9213 : Want to know more? Fill me in! I'm okay for now, kupo.
9214 : To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.
9215 : So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!
9216 : Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!
9217 : We've set up several checkpoints outside.
9218 : The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!
9219 : What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!
9220 : And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!
9221 : Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.
9222 : But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!
9223 : And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.
9224 : So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!
9225 : Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!
9226 : That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!
9227 : You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!
9228 : Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!
9229 : Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?
9230 : Is this partner okay with you? Perfect! I want to go with someone else...
9231 : Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!
9232 : Kupo? Where'd your partner go?
9233 : I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!
9234 : I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.
9235 : Kupopo! Congratulations! You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...
9236 : Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!
9237 : We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?
9238 : Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.
9239 : It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.
9240 : Are you ready now, kupo?
9241 : Leave town? Send me out! Not yet...
9242 : Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!
9243 : Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.
9244 : If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!
9245 : I can only give each person one item a day!
9246 : Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!
9247 : Kupo? You already have %...
9248 : Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!
9249 : The moogle hands % a small compass made from scintillant ore.
9250 : If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo!
9251 : What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!
9252 : Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...
9253 : Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...
9254 : Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...
9255 : % returns the compass to the moogle.
9256 : You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.
9257 : What is it? Do you want to start over?
9258 : Start over? Yes, please. No thanks.
9259 : You there. I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of ghosts?
9260 : Have you heard? Ghosts!? Yes, I've heard.
9261 : Then we may move on to more important matters.
9262 : Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?
9263 : <Sigh>... Allow me to explain. I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.
9264 : I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.
9265 : The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...
9266 : These ghosts are not simple apparitions.
9267 : When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.
9268 : And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.
9269 : The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control. I am at the point of capitulation.
9270 : That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.
9271 : I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.
9272 : Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.
9273 : Will you help? Of course. Not a ghost of a chance.
9274 : Ahaha... How droll. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
9275 : Most excellent. There is one thing you must be aware of, however.
9276 : These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.
9277 : If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.
9278 : I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.
9279 : The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.
9280 : Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.
9281 : Good luck.
9282 : Is that the glow of success I see upon your face? What of the spirit...?
9283 : I see... So that is her purpose...
9284 : The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.
9285 : I will prepare for the exorcism.
9286 : You have been a great help. Please take this as a token of my appreciation.
9287 : This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities. Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.
9288 : However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.
9289 : What has befallen you? Do you wish to give up?
9290 : Give up? I'm done. Not yet.
9291 : A pity. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
9292 : Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.
9293 : Ah, you're back! Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.
9294 : Will you consent to aid me again?
9295 : The second spirit is called Guwanana. She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.
9296 : Good day! I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?
9297 : I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.
9298 : I'll get straight to the point. Do you want to help in an exorcism?
9299 : Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess. Let me give you the short version:
9300 : I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.
9301 : For what? I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist. You know--a banisher of spirits.
9302 : But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.
9303 : They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.
9304 : The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the Cursed Tongue. That's not a language I can understand.
9305 : That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds. Then I can find a weakness.
9306 : That's where you come in...
9307 : I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.
9308 : Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.
9309 : What do you say? Will you help?
9310 : Oh... Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
9311 : Thank you! There is one thing you should know...
9312 : These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too. If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...
9313 : But don't give up if they catch on to you. Just put the disguise back on and try again.
9314 : I've located two spirits floating around this town.
9315 : The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp. I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.
9316 : Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.
9317 : Good luck!
9318 : Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...
9319 : Hmmm... So that's why...
9320 : It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here. The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...
9321 : It's time to begin my preparation.
9322 : Oh, and this is for you.
9323 : It's a witch hat. The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.
9324 : If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.
9325 : Giving up the ghost?
9326 : Oh... Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
9327 : Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!
9328 : You know what? I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.
9329 : What do you think?
9330 : Your target's name is Pretty Heart. Wonder why he's called that...
9331 : Really? I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...
9332 : Hi, I'm Gertrude. I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town. Have you heard anything?
9333 : You have? Well, that makes my job easier, then.
9334 : Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?
9335 : No? Then let me fill you in on the details.
9336 : I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.
9337 : A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.
9338 : But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.
9339 : In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.
9340 : Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.
9341 : In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.
9342 : The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.
9343 : And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.
9344 : Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?
9345 : Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard. Please come back if you change your mind.
9346 : Wonderful. There is one thing I must warn you of, however.
9347 : These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.
9348 : If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up. They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.
9349 : According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.
9350 : The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings. I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.
9351 : Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once. There are many preparations to be made.
9352 : Good luck!
9353 : How did you fare...?
9354 : I see, so that's why she...
9355 : However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.
9356 : I will begin preparing for the exorcism.
9357 : Your help has been invaluable. Would you accept this in appreciation?
9358 : It's a witch hat. Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...
9359 : If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.
9360 : What's wrong? Have you grown tired of your task?
9361 : Oh, I see... Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.
9362 : Then I would ask you to return to your task. Good luck.
9363 : Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?
9364 : I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.
9365 : Then your next target is the one known as Maryse. Please be careful...
9366 : You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders. Return to me once you have had time to rest.
9367 : I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts. Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.
9368 : I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.
9369 : !!! You...you're no monster!
9370 : !!! You...you're no monster!
9371 : !!! You...you're no monster!
9372 : !!! You...you're no monster!
9373 : So pretty...the fountain is still so...
9374 : That must be...the chateau... And over there...the cathedral...
9375 : I never thought...to return here...
9376 : Every morning...I watched him training...from afar... If only...I had had the courage...
9377 : No...he was a Hume... I...am a witch... If I were...to confess...
9378 : And then...there was the lunch...he always carried... Someone...must have made it...for him...
9379 : He passed...without ever knowing... But I...am still here...
9380 : I... I should no longer care... I want to forget...
9381 : The fountain where he took his rest... The stones that grew wet with his tears... Nothing has changed...except me...
9382 : The moat where he swam... The shade where he slept... It is still the same...
9383 : Ah...I know you are there... But to have someone hear my pain...has lightened my soul...if only a little...
9384 : This moat...where I fell in...
9385 : I slipped...on the bridge... I fell...
9386 : He was always there... I didn't notice...
9387 : From the time that I was small... Always there to save me...
9388 : Even when I was loathed and feared... You were there to praise my power...
9389 : My brother...
9390 : But I...I was always angry... I even forgot the lunch you made...
9391 : But here... I want to tell you just once...
9392 : Thank you... Thank you for being there...for me...
9393 : Your lunches...always made with so much care...
9394 : I see you there... Listening to me... I should curse you... But I will forgive you...as my brother would...
9395 : These trees... I burned with the Fire spell... Yet they have grown back...
9396 : This stream... I froze with Blizzaga II... Yet now it flows...
9397 : This building... I toppled with Aeroga III... Yet it has been rebuilt...
9398 : The wall of the Metalworks... I cracked with Thunder IV... Yet it has been repaired...
9399 : It is as if...I never existed... Have my sins...also been erased...?
9400 : My magic...has always been overpowerful... The cold stares...of the townspeople...
9401 : I learned my spells...for vengeance... People called me...heartless...
9402 : I loathed...this nation...this town...its people...
9403 : Then why...? Why do I feel so at home here...?
9404 : Why...? Why does everything feel...so dear to me...?
9405 : You...I see you... Cease your stalking... I wish to be alone...
9406 : A genius...is never understood...by the masses...
9407 : A genius...is isolated...from the common people...
9408 : A genius...will be persecuted...by those who do not understand...
9409 : I wanted to save her... The girl with astounding talent...
9410 : To help...the girl...who had nothing but her magic...
9411 : The Dark Lilies... A coven of...chosen... A sanctuary...for witches...
9412 : Yet...I wonder... Was it all...for the best...? To leave...this world behind...?
9413 : Was she...truly happy...? Being enveloped...in the darkness...?
9414 : I wanted to search...for the answers...one more time... In this town...the town I had forsaken...
9415 : I wished to gaze once more...on the answers to be found... In this town...that I once loved...
9416 : You...go back... Back to the exorcist... Tell him...I am ready...to leave...
9417 : This...was a secret place...
9418 : A place...that nobody knew...
9419 : The perrrfect spot...
9420 : An enchanted spot... So many fish... They would just jump...onto the hook...
9421 : To fill...my empty belly...
9422 : To help...my strrruggling mother...
9423 : I would fish...and fish...and fish... We were poor...I had no other choice...
9424 : Even so...those days were fun... But I hated...being poor... I delved...into forbidden magic...
9425 : I'm sorry...Mother... The day...I left home... I wanted...wanted to tell you...
9426 : I'm sorry... I brrroke my prrromise...to lead an honest life... I wanted...wanted to tell you...
9427 : Enough... You have learned my secret... Leave me in peace...
9428 : Glimmer...shimmer... Shimmer...glimmer...
9429 : Little fishies... Shimmering fishy-wishies... Where have you gone...?
9430 : Little fishies... Glimmering fishy-wishies... Are you here...?
9431 : You mustaru be here... You mustaru be hiding...
9432 : Here and there... The fishy-wishies I let free... Shimmering...glimmering...fish...
9433 : But...I don'taru see you...? Where have you gone...?
9434 : The same as before... Nowhere to be found...
9435 : But wait... That...shimmer-glimmering... The Flash spell fused into your scaly-wales...
9436 : Glimmer...shimmer... So many little fishy-wishies... You survived...
9437 : Shimmer...glimmer... So many little fishy-wishies... You swim...and glide...
9438 : Are you satisfied...? Then hushy-wush and leave... You'll scare the fishy-wishies...
9439 : You hear a voice speaking softly...
9440 : Trick or treat? I've seen the most sensationally scary costumes around town, kupo!
9441 : What a wonderful witch hat, kupo! Since you've shown me your costume, I'll bring out some of my special merchandise, kupo!
9442 : Are you bringing joy to the children of Vana'diel? Don't keep all that happiness to yourself, now!
9443 : What's the best way to make a child smile? Why, presents, of course! Children nowadays want all kinds of goodies. I'm a bit behind the times, so I'm afraid I can't offer any good advice as to what would be the best present.
9444 : But if you want to avoid suspicion, you'll need a red hat like mine. All smilebringers have them!
9445 : They should be for sale somewhere around here, so snap one up if you want it!
9446 : [You haven't brought any happiness to the children!/You've done some good./You have done fairly well./You have given the children much joy!/You have brought smile upon smile to the children!/You have the children bursting with glee!/The children love you!] [What a disappointment./You just need to give a little extra effort!/Keep it up!/You make a good smilebringer./Excellent work!/Stupendous job!/Even I think you're great!]
9447 : You can make good use of some of that joy you've brought to transport yourself to another nation. The children in other parts of Vana'diel need smiles, too!
9448 : Transport to another nation? Not now. Go to San d'Oria. Go to Bastok. Go to Windurst.
9449 : Happy travels!
9450 : Sorry, but it looks like you don't have enough joy and happiness in your life to do that. You can earn some by giving presents to children, though!
9451 : Leave this heap of future firewood to us, kupo! All we need from you is a couple cheers!
9452 : We have to run this monster out of town, kupo! The moogles will do all the work. All you have to do is cheer us along!
9453 : Bad tree! Bad tree! We won't let him get any further, kupo! Just keep cheering us on!
9454 : Thanks, everybody! Keep it up and there's no way we can lose, kupo!
9455 : 10000... 15000... 30000! The tree is gaining too much power! This doesn't look good, kupo!
9456 : Unnnnnngh... Bad tree! We won't let you get in the way of our plans this time, kupo!
9457 : Nnngahhh, kupo! I can't hold him back!
9458 : The Twinkling Treant sheds a solitary tear as it fades into nothingness...
9459 : Well, that was interesting. Who would have thought that one of our festival trees would just get up and start walking around? I'm just glad that it is all over.
9460 : However, there is something that still bothers me... It is like a dark cloud hanging over our fair city...
9461 : I've been so busy fighting treants and spreading love to the children, that it wasn't until recently that I heard the rumors of the other smilebringers...
9462 : I don't know what these imposters are cooking up, but if they are even thinking of laying a finger on the city's innocent children...
9463 : I hate to ask this of a stranger, but you look like someone I can trust. Would you please be so kind as to search out the false smilebringer and bring him to me so we can straighten this whole mess out?
9464 : You're back! Were you able to find the imposter?
9465 : You located him, but he managed to escape? Well, I guess that is better than nothing. Now that he knows we are on to him, perhaps he will cease to prey on the Kingdom's children.
9466 : I heard from another kind adventurer that the false smilebringer was passing out strange-looking boxes to the young ones... Why, for all I know, there could be live scorpions hiding in those packages, just waiting to sting the cute little button noses of all my little friends.
9467 : You don't know how much your kindness means to me. You're a little old to be my friend, but I'd like you to have this as a token of my appreciation.
9468 : Wow! That was pretty frightening. I'm all for tree's rights and everything, but once those guys start walking around my town...
9469 : Chop 'em up and toss them on the campfire, that's what I say. The only good tree is the one toasting my marshmallow.
9470 : Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something before you interrupted me there.
9471 : There are these strange midgets running around town claiming that they're smilebringers just like me.
9472 : I've had my hands so full chasing around the walking trees that I haven't been able to investigate. How about to make up for interrupting me back there, you go and see if you can find any juicy info on the fakes?
9473 : I'll be right here protecting the fountain from any more treant attacks. Let me know the moment you've learned something worthwhile.
9474 : Who the kewpo are you, kewpo? I'm nothing doing wrong here, see? I'm smilebringing to nice boys and girls, kewpo! Move along! Move along!
9475 : Ummm... I can explaining, kewpo...
9476 : Just not today! Kew-pooooooooo!
9477 : Back at last. Did you learn anything worth my partially divided attention?
9478 : Uh-huh... So you let the thing get away... Well, I guess that's what I get for relying on an amateur. My bad, my bad.
9479 : One of my other contacts told me that the little spud was passing out some strange kind of pastry to all the kids. So far I haven't heard of any diarrhea breakouts, but the day is still young.
9480 : I guess your scaring him off will put an end to this fiasco, but we can't be one hundred percent sure. Keep your eyes out for that pest and next time don't let him escape!
9481 : What? You want something for helping me out? Well, it is the Starlight Celebration. Why not? You only get what you give, right?
9482 : Arrrg, that there walkin' tree almost stepped on me and me parrot! One step closer and I'd be makin' meself a new peg leg out of its head.
9483 : Aye, speakin' o' peg legs, there be this mighty fishy landlubber swaggerin' 'round Windurs' posin' as a smilebringer. What's that got t' do with peg legs? Arrrg, never ye mind.
9484 : Ye only needs t' concern yerself with the fact that this imposter is encroachin' on me territory
9485 : Nobody, not even Davy Jones, has the right t' drop his anchor in me harbor without me express permission.
9486 : Arrrg, ye looks like a trustworthy soul. Could ye find it in yer heart t' help out a fellow pirate in need?
9487 : I've got a bad feelin' 'bout that tree, an' I want t' be 'round if anythin' goes awry.
9488 : Arrrg, did ye find that scurvy dawg an' make 'im walk the plank?
9489 : Ye say he just up an' vanished, now do ye? Well, I guess yer not t' blame.
9490 : One of me other mateys said they saw the rotten bringer prancin' round like a puppet an' passin' out strange presents t' the kiddies.
9491 : But now that ye've frightened 'im off, the city should be safe. Here, take this bit o' plunder. Ye've earned it, matey!
9492 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
9493 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
9494 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
9495 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
9496 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
9497 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
9498 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
9499 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
9500 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
9501 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
9502 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
9503 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
9504 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
9505 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
9506 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
9507 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
9508 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
9509 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
9510 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
9511 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
9512 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
9513 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
9514 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
9515 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
9516 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
9517 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
9518 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.
9519 : ...
9520 : Dancing now. Please observe.
9521 : Would like to join in dance?
9522 : Looks like he's taken a liking to you!
9523 : This little guy's name is Valkeng. What do you say, Val?
9524 : Nice to meet kind [sir/lady].
9525 : Ha ha, isn't he just the cutest thing?
9526 : But to tell the truth, it's only because I made him that way. I'm not sure if you noticed, but I was controlling his every movement!
9527 : Puppets like him are called automatons. They can do all sorts of things, but it all depends on the handler's skill.
9528 : I make my living entertaining people this way.
9529 : People who can control and customize automatons are referred to as puppetmasters in the Near East.
9530 : You say you'd like to give it a try yourself?
9531 : Ha ha, I'm afraid you've got to be a puppetmaster for that.
9532 : Eh? You want to be a puppetmaster, do you? Quite the hasty one, aren't we?
9533 : Well, if I had time, I'd be glad to teach you the ropes, but I can't make a living staying in the same town for months on end, now can I?
9534 : Ah, I have the perfect solution! You should meet with my pupil, Iruki-Waraki. I've taught him everything I know.
9535 : Not only that, but he's currently the most acclaimed puppeteer in Vana'diel! You should be able to find him entertaining the folk in Aht Urhgan Whitegate with his automaton.
9536 : He has grown far better than I. You really must witness his expertise before learning how to control an automaton yourself.
9537 : If you really want to become a puppetmaster, I advise speaking to Iruki-Waraki in Aht Urhgan Whitegate.
9538 : Puppeteering can be challenging, but don't let that get you down!
9539 : Good luck!
9540 : How is everything going?
9541 : My my, you've become a fine puppetmaster. I've got to work not to fall behind!
9542 : Anyway, is there something you wanted to ask about?
9543 : Haha, don't get me wrong. You just had the most inquisitive look on your face... Being able to read people's expressions is all part of my job, you know.
9544 : Seeing as we're both working in the same trade now, I'd be pleased to answer any question you have.
9545 : Iruki-Waraki's gotten into quite a predicament, hasn't he?
9546 : Still...a puppetmaster rejected by his own automaton... Haha, it's great! I could use a kicker like that in my next performance...
9547 : Wait, he wanted my advice?
9548 : Getting his automaton to appreciate him again should be a snap! Why, Iruki-Waraki possesses the most valuable thing a puppetmaster can have! Just let him know that.
9549 : His automaton just doesn't realize he has it.
9550 : Why, Iruki-Waraki doesn't even realize it himself.
9551 : What is valuable thing?
9552 : The most essential, important thing a puppetmaster can have is... No, that's not something I can tell just anyone.
9553 : First, I must determine whether or not you're worthy of knowing. Puppetmasters really should notice for themselves after having grown in their trade...
9554 : If you want to prove that you're worthy, take % and go to Talacca Cove on the Arrapago Islands.
9555 : Ah, but before that you'll also need a %. The Trolls used to use them during construction, so you might be able to find one on Mount Zhayolm.
9556 : Dangerous! Very dangerous!
9557 : Well, yes... It should be easy to bring Iruki-Waraki's automaton around, but the process leading up to that will be quite a trial.
9558 : Are you still sure you want to help out my pupil?
9559 : Help Iruki-Waraki? Rain or shine! Volcanoes? No thanks...
9560 : It looks like Iruki-Waraki has managed to find an excellent pupil of his own.
9561 : Eh, you're not his pupil? Well, either way, your support is admirable. I pray for your success.
9562 : Good luck!
9563 : What are you afraid of? Then again, if you don't want to admit your weakness, I suppose that's fine...
9564 : The world is full of trials, but you must keep your chin up and press on.
9565 : I'm glad you managed to make it back! You had me worried for a bit there.
9566 : So you want to hear the rest of what I had to say, right?
9567 : But first, I've got a question for you.
9568 : Will you let me know what your answer was in response to why you were able to defeat the automaton?
9569 : Why were you victorious? It was one-on-one. Shamarhaan wasn't there. My automaton is stronger.
9570 : Hmmm...not quite, but not far, either. If you think about it a little more, you should understand.
9571 : Because you were one-on-one... In other words, there is a significant difference between an automaton with a puppetmaster and an automaton on its own.
9572 : In other words...because the automaton was without its master, correct? This also implies that you would have lost if I had been there...
9573 : Yes... Now let me tell you the reason your automaton was able to grow stronger than a prime combat model...
9574 : Good puppeteers can bring out their automaton's potential. Without the puppeteer's efforts, the automaton can't realize its true strength.
9575 : An automaton without a puppeteer is like a goblin without a mask!
9576 : A goblin without a mask is...
9577 : What? Iruki-Waraki said the same thing!?
9578 : Why, the little... Making it look like I stole his phrase...
9579 : Waited so long to use phrase...for nothing!
9580 : Anyway, let's move on, shall we? Ahem, where were we now?
9581 : Ah, yes. An automaton's strength is brought out by the efforts of its puppetmaster. Even so, only a handful of puppetmasters in Vana'diel actually succeed in realizing their automaton's true power.
9582 : It requires a deep understanding of one's automaton and a great deal of trust.
9583 : You already know the most important thing a puppetmaster can have, don't you?
9584 : The battle against my automaton was a test to see how much strength you could draw from your automaton.
9585 : You passed! Adventurer is strong!
9586 : Yes... However, a good puppetmaster can bring out much more in the automaton than fighting ability.
9587 : An automaton's growth comes from the strength the puppetmaster helps it realize, and a puppetmaster is also only as good as his automaton.
9588 : Iruki-Waraki took that dilapidated old thing and made it into a magnificent automaton. I am certain he possesses that invaluable power...the power to bring out an automaton's potential.
9589 : Heh, long ago his automaton was the same as this one here... No, this automaton here is better than his was.
9590 : Hey, Mister, where'd the puppet go?
9591 : Ah, it's you again. You never get tired of coming here, do you?
9592 : Sorry, kid. I threw that thing away.
9593 : What!? What'd you do that for? I wanted to see its rocket punch again!
9594 : Yeah! Why'd you have to go and throw it away?
9595 : It's best not to have an unstable machine like that around. It couldn't even move after the Lamiae got to it, and dragging it around since has been a real pain... It needed to be thrown out, kids.
9596 : Heartless meanie!
9597 : You...great big pudding-head!
9598 : Come on, kids... Forget about it, already. That machine is worthless.
9599 : No! You're worthless!
9600 : That's right!
9601 : Fine! I'm going to go get it back!
9602 : Okay okay, whatever. Good luck, kid.
9603 : If you can find it, you can have it.
9604 : I can have it! You promised now, remember! I'll find it no matter what!
9605 : Miiister! Oh Miiister!
9606 : What's all the fuss about, kid? Did you find anything?
9607 : Yep, it was a snap! I'll show it to you in just a second!
9608 : Huh? You mean to tell me you went all the way to Arrapago...?
9609 : (The general public is prohibited from sailing to Nashmau now because of the epidemic...)
9610 : Here it is...
9611 : That's...the one, all right...
9612 : You promised! This puppet is mine now, right?
9613 : (But how on Urhguum did he... Hm? What's this?)
9614 : (It's not equipped with any weapon attachments at all... Only its outward appearance is the same...)
9615 : Where did you find this?
9616 : I found it at a shop. This weird-looking Galka left his shop to go pick things up.
9617 : I bet he just managed to find the one you threw out.
9618 : (A shop... Could he mean Ghatsad's workshop?)
9619 : (I've heard rumors that he's working on models for civilian use... What could that old cad be up to?)
9620 : There were heaps of puppets at his shop!
9621 : They sell puppets at shops, too? Wow!
9622 : ...
9623 : What's the matter? You said I could have this, right?
9624 : Ah...yeah, I did. But can it even function? It's been thrown out...and looks to be in quite a state of disrepair.
9625 : How should I know? And you're the one who threw it out!
9626 : Come on, stand up! Stand!
9627 : Well, that's not going to work. Doesn't it have a switch somewhere?
9628 : Uh... There's a weird stick-thingy attached to it here... Could this be it?
9629 : Whoa!
9630 : Eh!?
9631 : Wooow!
9632 : It's standing! This is so cool!
9633 : It's so cute!
9634 : My name is Iruki-Waraki. Do you understand?
9635 : % @ & $?
9636 : No! Say it right!
9637 : Ahaha! It's so cute!
9638 : Hey kids, don't get too close to it...
9639 : What's your name?
9640 : ...& @ %?
9641 : Elisabeth!? What a nice name!
9642 : How'd you get Elisabeth out of that!?
9643 : It's the same name as my pet little worm!
9644 : You keep a worm as a pet?
9645 : E...li...@ $?
9646 : Eh?
9647 : Huh?
9648 : Hm...?
9649 : E...li...sabeth?
9650 : Wow! This is so cool... Hey, my name is Iruki-Waraki. Iruki-Waraki, got it?
9651 : Iruki...Wa...raki?
9652 : Yes! It knows my name now!
9653 : ...
9654 : An automaton not used for battle... With this, maybe we could...
9655 : Huh? What's an otto-matin?
9656 : Automaton is the word for these kinds of puppets.
9657 : Auto...maton?
9658 : Nope, nope! Sorry, but your name is Elisabeth, and that's how it's gonna stay. You like your name, right, Elisabeth?
9659 : I hate it.
9660 : What!?
9661 : ...
9662 : M-maybe I'm just hearing things...
9663 : Anyway, don't you kids want to see this automaton do more than just stand?
9664 : Like what?
9665 : I want to see!
9666 : Why don't you try becoming a puppetmaster?
9667 : Puppet...master?
9668 : What do they do?
9669 : Haha, just wait until you see. I'm going to go have a little chat with Ghatsad now.
9670 : Hey, where are you going?
9671 : Oh, I just love Elisabeth... She's so cute...
9672 : I want to dress her up in all kinds of pretty things...
9673 : Don't even try it. Come on, Elisabeth. Let's go home.
9674 : I apologize. The more years pass by, the more I tend to think back on the past...
9675 : You should go back to Iruki-Waraki now.
9676 : Cheer him up for me, will you?
9677 : Cheer up Iruki!
9678 : Impressive...
9679 : You have trained up a magnificent automaton.
9680 : I am sure you have plenty of experience fighting monsters by now.
9681 : However, you must not strive for more power. You must find your own path as a puppetmaster.
9682 : If you waste your time chasing after power, it will eventually become a threat... You could even end up hurting those who are close to you.
9683 : Knowing this, if you still desire more... Find % and bring it to me.
9684 : However, I will determine myself whether or not you can manage such power.
9685 : Find % and bring it to me. I will determine myself whether or not you can manage such power.
9686 : It looks like you are ready.
9687 : We will meet where the Trolls punish their prisoners...the Navukgo Execution Chamber. There, you will do battle with me.
9688 : When you arrive, use this % to enter the battlefield.
9689 : You must prepare yourself first. I will go on ahead.
9690 : May we both grow in our trade.
9691 : Your % is torn...
9692 : Wow, I've never heard that before. You know everything, Grandpa!
9693 : Huh? Oh, a customer! Happy New Year!
9694 : What? Who was I talking to just now? Oh, the other day, this really nice old man gave me my very own % so I could call him whenever I wanted. He teaches me all sorts of things, and all I have to do is call him Grandpa and do whatever he says.
9695 : Just now, he was telling me about the fun-loving people walking around outside. I heard that something similar to this happened many years ago...
9696 : He also told me that if I give 'em something, they'll give me % in return. I really wanted one, so I was all ready to go through that gate over there when the guard gave me a nasty loxok...
9697 : Hey. You're an adventurer, right? Doesn't Altana say that you guys have to help little kids or your brain will melt and bugs will eat your ears? Go out and get me %, ASAP. Don't worry, you'll get your reward!
9698 : Whoa! You really brought me back %. Thanks!
9699 : I guess you'll be wanting your reward now, huh? Hmmm... How about I give you a choice?
9700 : I'll... Let you ask Grandpa a question. Give you something from my pocket. Tell you more about Grandpa.
9701 : Eh? That's all you want? Well, okay.
9702 : Hold on. I'll see if I can get through. Grandpa has a lot of little friends just like me, so his line is always busy.
9703 : Oh, hi Grandpa! Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... Sure... Uh-huh... Yeah... Okay... Sure... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... No, but... Yeah... Okay... Uh-huh... Right... Uh-huh... Not really... Sure... Okay... Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... I can do that... Uh-huh... Great... Yeah... Sure... Uh-huh... No... Not today... Maybe tomorrow... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah... Uh-huh... Wait... Actually, the reason I called was because there is this adventurer who wants to ask you a question.
9704 : Ask [him/her] [his/her] name? Okay. [Mister/Lady], what's your name?
9705 : % points to the name over [his/her] head.
9706 : The [guy/lady] says [his/her] name is %. Think we can believe [him/her]?
9707 : Okay, adventurer. Grandpa told me to tell you this...
9708 : The sable spirit of Diabolos looms in your wake.
9709 : Just as the ruler of dreams extends his nebulous arms to emancipate the righteous, you too harbor within your heart the strength to remain calm in dire straits, and lead those lambs who have strayed into the abyss to the light of victory.
9710 : In other words, he's saying you're a born leader! Why, shouldn't you be out gathering a party and giving orders, or something?
9711 : Oh, and he also says that even though you may have the makings of a great [man/woman], people will never follow you unless you tack some bravery and drive onto your resume. Go figure!
9712 : The scintillant spirit of Carbuncle hovers above you.
9713 : And just as the delicate ruby light from the bringer of rainbows soothes the weary soul, so too does the soft, warm radiance that shines forth from your heart unto those in need.
9714 : In other words, he's saying you're always nice to people. You know, helping them out with their problems and stuff. If you're not already a white mage, maybe you should think of a profession change.
9715 : Oh, and he also says that the only way that people will ever respect you is if you help them without expecting something in return. Kind of like helping a kid get a New Year's gift without wanting some kind of reward when you're done, wouldn't you say?
9716 : The dynamic spirit of Ramuh walks by your side.
9717 : Just as the world glows with his electric wisdom, your mind too glows with an infinite intelligence that sends shudders of excitement and awe throughout the masses.
9718 : In other words, you're a smart [guy/lady] who is chock full of curiosity and is always looking for a change. You wouldn't happen to be a red mage, would you?
9719 : Oh, and he also says that if you would just pay a little more attention to those around you, people might not say all that bad stuff behind your back. Go figure!
9720 : The lofty spirit of Titan towers above you.
9721 : Just as his adamantine will shields the meager from destitution, you too tread the path of life with caution while providing sanctuary for all souls who gather in the warmth of your heart.
9722 : In other words, you think before you act, unlike those creeps who shoot first and ask questions the next Firesday. Your ability to quickly identify an enemy's weak point and finish him off before he hurts your friends makes you good black mage material.
9723 : Oh, and he also says that if you were only a little more honest, then people might respect you more than they do that guy at the chocobo stables who sells everybody the gysahl greens with the bugs in 'em.
9724 : The whispering spirit of Garuda whisks about you.
9725 : Just as the avatar of wind roams free across the never-ending skies of Vana'diel, so too does your lucid heart yearn to break free of the chains that bind it to conformity.
9726 : In other words, he's saying that you were born to be an adventurer, and that your free spirit would make you a mighty good thief, if there is such thing as a good thief.
9727 : Oh, and he also says that you'd be a lot more popular if you'd stop trying to impress everyone and just be yourself. Go figure!
9728 : The lustrous spirit of Leviathan watches over you.
9729 : Just as the radiant visage of the guardian of seas renders vapid souls breathless, the pristine balance between your attention to beauty and respect for harmony are the waves upon which your companions cast their vessels.
9730 : In other words, that pristine balance helps you from being swayed by the poison opinions of others, and grants you good judgment in sticky situations. Add to that all that talk about harmony, and it sounds to me like you'd make a good bard.
9731 : Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop worrying about what you wear on the outside and concentrated more on polishing what's inside, people might actually stop avoiding you. Go figure!
9732 : The chilling spirit of Shiva shadows your soul.
9733 : And just as her veil of hoarfrost hides the world from the eyes of men, you too don a shroud of discretion as you journey alone through the valleys of solitude.
9734 : In other words, he's saying that you're a calm, cool, and collected player who has an answer for all the challenges life throws at you. Sounds like blue mage material to me!
9735 : Oh, and he also said that if you'd stop picking out people's faults and concentrate on what they've got on the inside, maybe you'll learn what true friendship is. Ouch!
9736 : The searing spirit of Ifrit walks alongside you.
9737 : Just as the inferno within his soul spits forth flames of undying emotion, the fire deep in your heart burns with the passion and determination to face any challenge.
9738 : In other words, once you've set your mind on something, a bucket full of pamama au lait ain't gonna stop you from charging in the room and unloading your quiver of bloody bolts on anything that stands in your way. Sounds like a grade-A warrior to me.
9739 : Oh, and he also said that if you would start being a little more decisive, people would stop refusing to be in your party because they thought it was going to take you three days to decide on a place to camp lesser colibri. Go figure!
9740 : The daunting spirit of Odin stands alert at your side.
9741 : Just as the mighty conqueror's ambition drives him to Victory's bosom, so too does the harmony within your heart guide stray souls to the paths they seek.
9742 : In other words, he's saying that your belief in your faith, along with your hating of all that is wrong, keeps your heart pure--pure enough to endure the trials of a paladin.
9743 : Oh, and he also says that you're actually really sensitive, but too ashamed to show people your true feelings, so you pent them all up inside. You'd better fix that or you'll find yourself battling some nasty ulcers. Cheers!
9744 : The noble spirit of Fenrir guards your shadows.
9745 : Just as the guardian of the moon's light drives darkness from the kingdom of night, you follow the sun across land and sky, from dawn until dusk, from birth until death. You see the world on a scale that dwarfs even the mightiest of mountains and their snow-laden peaks.
9746 : In other words, he's saying that you're always in search of a good time, and are always up to speed with the latest fads and fashions. Maybe you should think about being a corsair or a puppetmaster. Come on! Everyone's doing it!
9747 : Oh, and he also said that your refusal to act normal every now and then freaks a lot of people out. Keep that in mind before you go running down to the auction house wearing only your subligar.
9748 : The mighty spirit of Bahamut hovers above you.
9749 : Just as the Wyrmking rules the skies with his mere presence, so too do you stand above lesser men with your distinct aura of fortune and conviction.
9750 : In other words, he's saying that by combining the logic and ideals that clutter your brain with a little of the luck that saves your lazy bum all the time, you'd have the power to summon great power...like a summoner!
9751 : Oh, and he also says that if you'd stop trying so hard and rely a little more on the smiles that Fortune keeps wafting your way, people might actually think you're competent. Go figure!
9752 : Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, [he/she] looks really pleased with your answer.
9753 : You want me to tell [him/her] that, too? Alright. Grandpa says that all journeys begin with faith in oneself. Take a good look at what lurks inside before stepping out...
9754 : Whatever that means. I don't understand half the stuff he says, but I like him because he gives me candy.
9755 : I knew it. You adventurers are all alike. Here, take this. It was getting sweaty in my pocket anyway.
9756 : You want to know about Grandpa? Actually, I don't know if I can tell you much.
9757 : He comes to visit sometimes, and gives me presents, but he never says where he's traveled from or where he's going.
9758 : Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being somewhere high up where he could see for malms...
9759 : Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some big white contraption...
9760 : Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about it not costing so much when he was younger...
9761 : Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about being able to see some huge-mongous tree...
9762 : Although earlier today on the linkshell he said something about traveling back and forth...
9763 : He said the same thing yesterday, so he may still be in the same place. Are you thinking about going and getting some candy, too?

9943 : Hm... This seems to be in great condition! We shouldn't need to do any work on it at the moment.
9944 : Hm... This %'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak...
9945 : For a small fee, I can give you a new % in exchange for it if you wish.
9946 : Pay for a new whistle? (# gil) Yes, please. Not yet.
9947 : Here you go. Take good care of it.

9954 : Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?
9955 : What would you like to say? Nothing. I'm sorry. It's just an animal! We weren't compatible. Take good care of it.
9956 : Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...
9957 : Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...
9958 : ... I'm disappointed in you.
9959 : I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!

9961 : Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!
9962 : You really want to retire your chocobo?

9983 : The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.
9984 : They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.
9985 : Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.
9986 : Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.
9987 : They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.
9988 : The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.
9989 : But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!
9990 : Ask about which attribute? Strength. Endurance. Discernment. Receptivity. Energy. Affection. Satisfaction. Nothing.
9991 : Strength is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.
9992 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
9993 : Endurance is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.
9994 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
9995 : Discernment is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.
9996 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
9997 : Receptivity is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.
9998 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
9999 : Energy is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.
10000 : You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!
10001 : Affection is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!
10002 : You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.
10003 : If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it %, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.
10004 : Satisfaction is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.
10005 : However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.
10006 : What would you like to ask about? What is a care schedule? Basic care. Resting. Taking a walk. Listening to music. Exercising alone. Exercising in a group. Interacting with children. Interacting with chocobos. Carrying packages. Exhibiting to the public. Delivering messages. Digging for treasure. Acting in a play. Nothing.
10007 : A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.
10008 : How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.
10009 : You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).
10010 : When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.
10011 : With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.
10012 : The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.
10013 : You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.
10014 : The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.
10015 : However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.
10016 : We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.
10017 : Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.
10018 : Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.
10019 : If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10020 : Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.
10021 : If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10022 : Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.
10023 : However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.
10024 : If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10025 : Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.
10026 : But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.
10027 : If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10028 : You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!
10029 : The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.
10030 : You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.
10031 : The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.
10032 : You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!
10033 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10034 : You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.
10035 : The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.
10036 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10037 : You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.
10038 : You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10039 : What would you like to ask about? A general explanation. Watching over your chocobo. Telling a story. Scolding. Competing. Taking a walk. Nothing.
10040 : In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.
10041 : Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.
10042 : On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.
10043 : However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.
10044 : You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.
10045 : Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.
10046 : You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.
10047 : I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)
10048 : Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.
10049 : This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.
10050 : Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.
10051 : You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.
10052 : I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.
10053 : Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!
10054 : What would you like to know about? Why feeding is important. Vegetables. Wildgrasses. Carrots. Worms. Medicines. Pastes. Nothing.
10055 : Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.
10056 : However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.
10057 : The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.
10058 : At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!
10059 : Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.
10060 : There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!
10061 : Just trade the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.
10062 : This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which % are most popular.
10063 : Chocobos also seem to enjoy % and %.
10064 : These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.
10065 : Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.
10066 : %, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to %, the effects are different.
10067 : In addition, % is effective for illness, and % for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.
10068 : Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.
10069 : %, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and % are good for its mental attributes. % are in a category of their own.
10070 : Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.
10071 : Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!
10072 : For example, % will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and % will restore its energy.
10073 : But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...
10074 : The most curious of all the worms is the %. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...
10075 : Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.
10076 : % will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.
10077 : % are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.
10078 : A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.
10079 : Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.
10080 : You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.
10081 : Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.
10082 : Which would you like to ask about? Abilities. Temperament. Weather preferences. Nothing.
10083 : Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.
10084 : For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.
10085 : Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.
10086 : But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.
10087 : The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.
10088 : Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.
10089 : Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.
10090 : Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.
10091 : You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.
10092 : After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.
10093 : When your chocobo retires, you will receive %. Be sure not to lose it.
10094 : You can use the % to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.
10095 : The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!
10096 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.
10097 : You will need % and % if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.
10098 : You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them %.
10099 : I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.
10100 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using %.
10101 : You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.
10102 : That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.
10103 : When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade % to a VCS member.
10104 : Also, the %'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.
10105 : If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.
10106 : What would you like to ask about? %. Chococards. %. Nothing.
10107 : % proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.
10108 : With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.
10109 : If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!
10110 : You can use % to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.
10111 : The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.
10112 : Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get %, so good luck with that...
10113 : Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.
10114 : If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.
10115 : Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.
10116 : If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade % to a VCS member.

10338 : no longer seems lonely.
10339 : ...Oho, you are not afraid that it has stopped caring about you, are you?

10470 : You just started raising the poor creature! You are absolutely sure you want to do this?
10471 : Fine. Then you will never see your chocobo again. Is that all right with you?

10484 : I see. May you always continue to care for your chocobo!
10485 : You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.
10486 : Are you sure you want to retire ?
10487 : Retire ? Yes. Not yet!

10489 : Really retire your chocobo? Yes, really! No, I've changed my mind!
10490 : Understood. Then the chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's stables. Now is the time to say your goodbyes.
10491 : Understood. It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.

10504 : I have your % right here. You may take it now.
10505 : You lost your %?
10506 : I can give you a new one, but it will cost you # gil.
10507 : This item links you and  together. You would be wise not to lose it again.
10508 : It seems you are taking fine care of this. There seems to be no problem.
10509 : This %'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.
10510 : I can give you a new % in exchange for it if you wish.
10511 : Here you go. Take good care of it.
10512 : All right... You can have this back, then.
10513 : Let me give you a new % in exchange for this old one.
10514 : And do not worry about the usual fee. The % is all I need from you this time.
10515 : I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.

10527 : I see... So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.
10528 : %, might I ask you a favor? Do you think you could search for this chick's owner? We will take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.
10529 : Its owner must be searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.
10530 : If you discover any relevant information, have Arvilauge take down the details for you.
10531 : %, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I have been collecting information on my own time, as well...

10537 : That is all I could find. I will leave the rest in your capable hands.

10539 : I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.
10540 : I am terribly sorry, but that choice violates the VCS naming conventions. Might I trouble you to choose another combination?
10541 : Lately,  has been crying loud enough at night to wake the dead.
10542 : Chicks tend to cry a lot, but I think this is worse than normal...
10543 : I've got an idea. Could you hold on to this % for a while?
10544 : Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.
10545 : I think that should be enough. Let me see the % now.
10546 : should be able to sleep well with this.
10547 : Thanks to the %,  has been sleeping like a baby.
10548 : I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.

10773 : %, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.

10787 : I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...
10788 : I know! Could you hold on to this % for a while?

10792 : Thanks to the %,  has been sleeping like a baby!
10793 : I haven't seen you around lately, so I gave the chick something myself to help it sleep better.

11213 : Ah, it appears your chocobo found this during one of your walks.
11214 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
11215 : Looks like your chocobo found this on one of your walks.
11216 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
11217 : It seems your chocobo found this on one of your walks.

11221 : Could not trade the % and %. Please try again.
11222 : Hear the report? Hear a detailed report. Hear a brief report. Skip the report. I'm done here.
11223 : Are you sure? Yes. No.
11224 : Continue the report? Please do. I've heard enough.
11225 : Skip all remaining reports? No. Yes.
11226 : One moment please...
11227 : Choose the pace for your [short walk/regular walk/long walk]. Leisurely. Brisk. Cancel.
11228 : Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.
11229 : I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.
11230 : Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess % or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.
11231 : How about you, [sir/ma'am]?
11232 : If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in [Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.
11233 : What do you say? Tell me more. Sign me up! Not today.
11234 : Congratulations, %! You are now an official member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
11235 : I see. Please come back if you ever change your mind!
11236 : What would you like to know? Why race chocobos, anyway? How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kind of races are there? What are racing teams? Quit. Return.
11237 : Why not!? Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.
11238 : We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A win-win situation, as we like to call it in the business.
11239 : However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...
11240 : The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.
11241 : And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.
11242 : Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!
11243 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
11244 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
11245 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
11246 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
11247 : Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.
11248 : Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.
11249 : In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.
11250 : Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.
11251 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
11252 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
11253 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
11254 : There are two main types of races.
11255 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
11256 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
11257 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
11258 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
11259 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.
11260 : You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)
11261 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
11262 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
11263 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
11264 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
11265 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
11266 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
11267 : Ah, it says here that you are a member of the [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
11268 : Have you come today to change your affiliation?
11269 : Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
11270 : Join this team? Yes. No.
11271 : Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
11272 : Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.
11273 : Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.
11274 : What do we have here...
11275 : %:
11276 : Alright, %, I will store this in our safe.
11277 : Alright, %, I will store these in our safe.
11278 : I am sorry, but you have already brought me one of those.
11279 : I am sorry, but you have already brought me these items.
11280 : Hello! What might I interest you in today?
11281 : (You have # [chocobuck/chocobucks].) Chocobo [registration/confirmation]. Item confirmation. Free run (# gil). Official race (# [chocobuck/chocobucks]). Re-run. Rule confirmation. Nothing.

11283 : You cannot access this menu until you have registered a chocobo to race.
11284 : To register your chocobo, you must first bring me either % or %.
11285 : You can only register one chocobo at a time, but you may always register a new one whenever you wish.
11286 : We currently hold for you:  %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Quit. Return.

11289 : Re-run which race? Novice Race I. Novice Race II. Novice Race III. Challenge Race I. International Race I. International Race II. Challenge Race II. CRA Classic. Quit. Return.

11293 : ----------------------------------------
11294 : Free Run Chocobos: 8 Objective: None
11295 : While free runs usually have no specific objectives, the higher your chocobo places, the better the prize you will receive. We suggest you use these races to improve your skills before embarking on the more difficult official races.
11296 : Here is the information on the next race:
11297 : Novice Race I Chocobos: 4 Objective: Place 3rd or higher

11300 : This time, your chocobo will be pitted against five opponents. Use your knowledge of your bird's strengths to provide the jockey with the most appropriate orders.
11301 : Novice Race III Chocobos: 8 Objective: Place 3rd or higher
11302 : This race is quite similar to a free run in that there will be seven other chocobos racing against you. If you have one available, try equipping an item to improve your bird's performance.

11439 : Here you can sign up your race chocobo to take part in our races.
11440 : Please note that once you sign up for a race, you will be unable to compete again for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
11441 : All right. First of all, we will have to choose a saddle for your mount.

11443 : A standard model, the lauan saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride.
11444 : A standard model, the ash saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
11445 : A standard model, the elm saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
11446 : A bit on the hefty side, the brass saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
11447 : A bit on the hefty side, the silver saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
11448 : A bit on the hefty side, the mythril saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
11449 : This lightweight grass saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
11450 : This lightweight cotton saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
11451 : This lightweight linen saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
11452 : Crafted from the finest rabbit hide, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
11453 : Crafted from the finest sheep leather, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
11454 : Crafted from the finest buffalo leather, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
11455 : Now that that's settled, if you'd kindly select the lane in which you'd like to race. The lanes are numbered in ascending order from innermost to outermost. The following lanes are now available:

11459 : Do you wish to proceed? Yes! I'm ready to tear up the track! I'm getting cold feet...
11460 : Very well. You have now been registered to race.
11461 : My apologies, but it seems that over four weeks have elapsed since your last race. As much as it pains me to do so, I will be forced to deduct # Solo Victory [Point/Points] from your account.
11462 : I'm sorry, but I am unable to process your registration at this time.
11463 : I apologize, but the slot you have applied for has already been taken.

11478 : Join the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team? Yes, at once. No, not now.
11479 : If you would just wait one moment while I fill out the necessary paperwork...
11480 : Congratulations, %! You have just become the newest member of the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
11481 : You really want to nullify your affiliation with the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team and join another?

11524 : Current Standings Three-nation deadlock!
11525 : Last Week's Standings Team San d'Oria: # Team Bastok: # Team Windurst: #
11526 : Helping your team into first will give you certain advantages over your rivals! That should give you something to strive for!
11527 : What would you like to know about? The promenade. Chocobet centers. The grandstand. Portals. Guides. Nothing for now.
11528 : Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.
11529 : It can be found just south of here.
11530 : The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.
11531 : Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring %, as well as collecting your winnings.
11532 : There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.
11533 : All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.
11534 : The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.
11535 : To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.
11536 : The standard admission fee is # gil. Patrons who possess % may enter free of charge.
11537 : % will be provided anytime you purchase % or sign up for a race.
11538 : Your % will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.
11539 : This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.
11540 : As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.
11541 : For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished. Your cooperation is appreciated.
11542 : Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.
11543 : They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.
11544 : This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.
11545 : What would you like to know about? Racing teams. Race rules. Race types. Victory points. Race Progression. That's about it.
11546 : A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.
11547 : Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.
11548 : In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.
11549 : For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.
11550 : The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.
11551 : What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.
11552 : Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.
11553 : Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.
11554 : The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.
11555 : The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.
11556 : The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.
11557 : In such an event, the less endowed of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.
11558 : Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.
11559 : Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the race grade.
11560 : For example, a C4 Chocobo Race would indicate a typical grade 4 race.
11561 : We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.
11562 : No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.
11563 : Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.
11564 : As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.
11565 : Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.
11566 : Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.
11567 : Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.
11568 : The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.
11569 : As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.
11570 : Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.
11571 : We have a total of four races that run in succession.
11572 : Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.
11573 : Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.
11574 : Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!
11575 : What would you like to hear more about? Race preparations. Signup procedure. Collecting winnings. Signing up for another race. I'm fine, thanks.
11576 : There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.
11577 : First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.
11578 : Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a race chocobo, for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.
11579 : Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...
11580 : All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.
11581 : A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.
11582 : Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.
11583 : There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.
11584 : There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.
11585 : Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given %, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.
11586 : In the event that you should lose or misplace your %, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.
11587 : The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!
11588 : You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.
11589 : To collect, simply hand in the % you received during race signup at any signup center.
11590 : The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.
11591 : You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.
11592 : After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
11593 : This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.
11594 : We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.
11595 : What would you like to ask? What is chocobetting? How do I bet? What are odds? When do I bet? How do I collect winnings? Nothing.
11596 : Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.
11597 : To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.
11598 : Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.
11599 : For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.
11600 : And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.
11601 : Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.
11602 : The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!
11603 : To place a chocobet, you must obtain % from the chocobet center.
11604 : For any single %, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.
11605 : We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.
11606 : Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.
11607 : Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.
11608 : It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.
11609 : What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.
11610 : Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.
11611 : The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.
11612 : Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.
11613 : Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.
11614 : Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.
11615 : Once the race is finished, you can exchange your % at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.
11616 : Without % you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.
11617 : % is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.
11618 : Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.
11619 : Attention, racers. Signups for the following race are now open:
11620 : Please speak with the attendant wearing [an orange/a green/a red/a blue] uniform and a red beret for details. ----------

11672 : You obtain %!
11673 : Greetings, and welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service area is here to accommodate our more experienced and accomplished racers.
11674 : I am truly sorry [sir/ma'am], but we are unable to service your request here. This service area only caters to [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] CRA Classic winners.
11675 : Registration for such an event can be carried out at the service areas for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
11676 : The organizing attendants in each location are as follows: [Southern San d'Oria: Alangriche/Bastok Mines: Jazgeh/Windurst Waters: Turumi-Byrumi] [Northern San d'Oria: Monteverle/Bastok Markets: Galienne/Windurst Port: Lhimo Keanyohn] [Port San d'Oria: Ramiene/Port Bastok: Salvador/Windurst Woods: Rungaga].
11677 : For beginning and intermediate races, you'll want to speak with [Alangriche/Jazgeh/Rungaga].
11678 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
11679 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for advanced and veteran racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
11680 : Which would you like to hear about? CRA rationale behind veteran races. How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kinds of races are there? What are racing teams? What about race opponents? Quit. Return.
11681 : With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.
11682 : As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!
11683 : The Monster Races!
11684 : Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing!
11685 : Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele. What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?
11686 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
11687 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
11688 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
11689 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
11690 : Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!
11691 : The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal. It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.
11692 : Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern. If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.
11693 : Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area. Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.
11694 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
11695 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
11696 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
11697 : There are two main types of races.
11698 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
11699 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
11700 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
11701 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
11702 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.
11703 : You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Thank you for your understanding.
11704 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
11705 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
11706 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
11707 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
11708 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
11709 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
11710 : Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.
11711 : We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence. The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.
11712 : Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits. And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.
11713 : As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind. It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack. Consider yourself warned.
11714 : In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well. Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part. It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!
11715 : Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed. These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.
11716 : Dueler's Race Participants: 2 Objective: Place 1st
11717 : And now, Markovich's undeniably unorthodox, and arguably downright unethical, monster race is about to begin!
11718 : Survival Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
11719 : Following such a fine showing in the Dueler's Race, the next contest is about to start! Who will be the last beast standing?
11720 : Deadly Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
11721 : Warning! The next race contains monsters of unprecedented nastiness. Enter at your own risk! The name says it all!
11722 : Mystery Race Participants: 4 chocobos & 4 ??? Objective: Place 1st
11723 : What's this? We've been asked to pass along yet another challenge, this time from an anonymous source! I'm not altogether clear on what is about to transpire...
11724 : Lethal Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
11725 : The games are over, ladies and gentlemen. Markovich is laying it all on the table. Here come his most ferocious beasts to date!
11726 : Dream Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
11727 : This is the moment you've all been waiting for. The CRA has brought its racing elite out from the stables! The treacherous offroad track is fraught with perils! And an absolutely awe-inspiring trophy is ready for the winner! Bragging rights for life are on the line!

11776 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.
11777 : Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...
11778 : ...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.
11779 : Good day, fol--
11781 : Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.
11782 : Alrighty then, our next race features # of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.
11783 : First we have , who will be ridden by [the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing allstar, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].
11785 : She says, When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.
11786 : She says, And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' allstar!
11787 : She says, This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.
11788 : She says, There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.
11789 : She says, This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.
11790 : She says, Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.
11791 : She says, This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.
11792 : She says, This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'
11793 : Next we have [Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by [the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].
11794 : Sakura says, Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!
11795 : Sakura says, This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.
11796 : Sakura says, Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.
11797 : Our next chocobo is [Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by [Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].
11798 : Sakura says, Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.
11799 : Sakura says, She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.
11801 : Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...
11802 : The next contestant is [Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by [chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].
11803 : She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.
11804 : She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.
11805 : She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.
11806 : And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.
11807 : And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?
11808 : The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.
11809 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
11810 : And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
11811 : ...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!
11812 : Good day, fol--
11814 : Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.
11815 : And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!
11816 : ##:  ##:  ##:  ##:
11817 : And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
11818 : Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
11819 : I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.
11820 : Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!
11821 : Yeah... Good luck, %...
11822 : Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.
11823 : And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, [Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].
11824 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'
11825 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.
11826 : Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.
11827 : They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.
11828 : Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell [him/her], Wahboud!
11829 : Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!
11830 : As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.
11831 : %. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.
11832 : Good luck, %. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!
11833 : Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!
11834 : And next we have [Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by [VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].
11836 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.
11837 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.
11838 : Sakura says, Big things often come in small packages.
11839 : Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--
11840 : a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!
11841 : This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.
11842 : Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!
11843 : It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted piece de resistance?
11844 : We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.
11845 : Well, there you have it.
11846 : Now let's take a look at today's participants...
11847 : Ladies and gentlemen! President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...
11848 : ...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!
11849 : Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.
11850 : Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?
11851 : Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?
11852 : Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--
11853 : The Rakapopo Cup!
11854 : Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Kupipi!
11855 : So, I've learned that you have entered your very own personal chocobo in the cup. What do you think her chances are of taking home the grand prize?
11856 : Are you making fun of me, sir!? Well, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my gutty-wutty when my Starlight sails across the finish line years before the nearest competitaru!
11857 : Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.
11858 : My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!
11859 : [Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing allstar/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Never heard of [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!
11860 : We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one Kamp Kweh. We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.
11861 : Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...
11862 : Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take more than an embiggened brainy-wainy to beat Starlight!
11863 : What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.
11864 : Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...
11865 : Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fan! I won't let Starlight lose to some imposter!
11866 : Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called reincarnate's redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!
11867 : Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?
11868 : Hah! Well, I have been riding chocobos for twenty-one years!
11869 : And next is [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by [San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!
11870 : Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.
11871 : Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...
11872 : Both Starlight and the professor hate to take orders... Maybe that's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!
11873 : The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.
11874 : When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.
11875 : When the professor's not stumbling over his speech impediment-ethy, he's researching the intricacies of chocobo behavioral patterns.
11876 : And they're off!
11877 : Markovich, what did you think of the start?
11878 : Well, I fel--
11880 : Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
11881 : Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
11882 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
11883 : And as they pass the halfway mark...
11884 : ##  holds on to the lead!
11885 : # different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!
11886 : While from behind the pack, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
11887 : While from behind, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
11888 : All # chocobos battle for the lead!
11889 : Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
11890 : And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
11892 : Sakura says, The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.
11893 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
11894 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
11895 : Incredible! 's speed is approaching dangerous limits!
11896 : It looks like  is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!
11897 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
11898 : 's speed has begun to drop off!
11899 : It looks like  has begun to tire!
11900 : The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
11901 : The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
11902 : The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
11903 : The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
11904 : The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for !?
11905 : Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for !?
11906 : And yet  seems completely unaffected by the attack!
11907 : And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
11908 : And now they're approaching the final corner!
11909 : ##  still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
11910 : It's crowded up front with # chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
11911 : ##  is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
11912 : It's crowded up front with all # chocobos still fighting for the lead!
11913 : The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
11914 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ##  today!
11915 : And  takes the crown!
11916 : What's this? ##  is making its move on the lead!
11917 : And it's  by a beak!!!
11918 : Let's take a look at the results...
11919 : #:  (##)
11920 : There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!
11921 : Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.
11922 : Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.
11923 : Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.
11924 : What an amazing race! The other chocobos were no match for [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?
11925 : What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?
11926 : [Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!
11927 : The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.
11928 : Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!
11929 : Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...
11930 : Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exactly as I expected!
11931 : The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no way Starlight could lose! Her horoscope said so!
11932 : And there you have it. This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!
11933 : And now, let's see the results from the last race.
11934 : #:  (##)
11935 : And that's all she wrote, folks!
11936 : The winnings for a #-# bet come to # gil per quill!
11937 : Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
11938 : She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
11939 : She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
11940 : Until next time, race fans...
11941 : Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.
11942 : Taking the crown for today's race was none other than !
11943 : To the winning steed's owner we present the %, %, and the exalted title of Rocochookie, I mean, Chocorookie!
11944 : And to the ambitious and sporting %, we present this undeniably useful %!
11945 : Good show, %. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.
11946 : Excellent race, %! You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.
11947 : Okay, maybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I still think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!
11948 : Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.
11949 : But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.

11963 : With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...
11964 : Oh...? Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?
11965 : I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.
11966 : Is that so...? Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...
11967 : Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone. You of all people should know that the show must go on!
11968 : Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own baby will be taking the field!
11969 : Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!
11970 : But of course! I had forgotten all about it! Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you! Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!
11971 : But that's not where it ends! There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?
11972 : A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself. Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?
11973 : It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.
11974 : Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state! But...
11975 : But...?
11976 : I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.
11977 : I see... Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?
11978 : You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo. Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?
11979 : But enough talking, I say. It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!
11980 : Oh, yes, right... Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay! It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!
11981 : In the chocobo corner, we have , undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.
11982 : Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo? I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.
11983 : 's formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, a wolf in sheep's clothing!
11984 : I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!
11985 : I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?
11986 : Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that monsters like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.
11987 : Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!
11988 : With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!
11989 : Whoopee! Bring them on, I say!
11990 : Erm...yes... Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.
11991 : Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.
11992 : Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki! Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.
11993 : Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo. I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.
11994 : And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!
11995 : My, oh my...! I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--
11996 : A-ahem! I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.
11997 : All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies! Well done, my pretty! Well done!
11998 : It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders... <Sniffle>
11999 : Next in the lineup is Sakura. ...!? What on Vana'diel!?
12000 : Hrmmm... Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
12001 : Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...
12002 : What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man! There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!
12003 : Um, yes... Please forgive me...
12004 : And won't you look at the lineup! This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks? I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?
12005 : And with me today is our regular guest commentator...
12006 : Huh? Why isn't Markovich here?
12007 : Ohohohohohoho! You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.
12008 : <Gulp> You...you're that mage from Windurst...
12009 : ...Professor Shantotto!
12010 : If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich, as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.
12011 : Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence, four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.
12012 : So if you care to hear out my little proposal, these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.
12013 : With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice... Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?
12014 : With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused? Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.
12015 : First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.
12016 : Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold. I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.
12017 : Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.
12018 : Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word failure. Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.
12019 : Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.
12020 : Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable. If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.
12021 : Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!
12022 : For Ace of Trophies, championship contender is an unfitting description. Even consecutive champion would not be too high an expectation.
12023 : Um...Professor Shantotto... Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?
12024 : Ohohohohoho! Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so. But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!
12025 : Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage. Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.
12026 : Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview. So let the race begin, without further ado!
12027 : Ohohohohohoho! Of this inevitable result, I was always assured-- that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!
12028 : The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor. But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.
12029 : H-hey! What do you think you're trying to pull here!?
12030 : My, my, what a pleasant surprise! I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.
12031 : How dare you ohoho your way into my hard-earned commentary seat! This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!
12032 : Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification. I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.
12033 : And you, Goccilo! What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!
12034 : Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing! Until next time...!
12035 : %, I knew you'd make it all the way here.
12036 : What's with the baffled expression? It's me, Sakura.
12037 : You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird. I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.
12038 : I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.
12039 : I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...
12040 : And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.
12041 : I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.
12042 : Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.
12043 : I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.
12044 : I hope that'll be your chocobo, %!
12045 : And next, we have Sakura. But something seems to be different... Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.
12046 : She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!
12047 : The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.
12048 : I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround! A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.
12049 : And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.
12050 : It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.
12051 : And that completes the lineup, folks. With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!
12052 : You find %.
12053 : Welcome to the Dream Race, %.
12054 : I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.
12055 : I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.
12056 : I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.
12057 : But no more... If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.
12058 : This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.
12059 : I won't hold back in today's race, %.
12060 : Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.
12061 : Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.
12062 : I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?
12063 : Next, we have Sakura...
12064 : Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!? This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!
12065 : Well I'll be... In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!
12066 : ...
12067 : Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks. For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?
12068 : %, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded %, %, and the exalted title of Chocochampion!
12069 : Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far! Congratulations!
12070 : Great race, %. It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.
12071 : But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come.. With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...
12072 : Princess... Princess Sakura!
12073 : Princess...? What are you talking about? Who are you?
12074 : Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion. I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.
12075 : Searching for...me?
12076 : Yes, Your Highness. You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.
12077 : Are you serious!? Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?
12078 : That is correct. Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.
12079 : D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?
12080 : ...! I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...
12081 : Wh...what happened?
12082 : You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world. You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...
12083 : She...she gave up her life to save me?
12084 : Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again. But, I never once gave up hope...
12085 : My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.
12086 : So that's what happened...
12087 : Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos!
12088 : ...
12089 : I'm sorry, but I can't go.
12090 : Your Highness! But...why!?
12091 : Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like %'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.
12092 : What's more...
12093 : I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...
12094 : I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.
12095 : What...?
12096 : The only place I belong is here, beside you.
12097 : And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer? I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?
12098 : I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!
12099 : Heehee! Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!
12100 : %, I'm looking forward to our rematch! Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?
12101 : You're still here, eh, %?
12102 : Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?
12103 : What? How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?
12104 : Hohoho... It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.
12105 : I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...
12106 : Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos? No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.
12107 : Sakura is the queen, you say?
12108 : <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises. But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.
12109 : You know what they say: Home is where the heart is. To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.
12110 : And you, our new Chocochampion! Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.
12111 : Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today. These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.
12112 : And they're off!
12113 : Hrmmm! [Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
12114 : Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
12115 : All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance. But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
12116 : Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
12117 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
12118 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
12119 : The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
12120 : The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
12121 : And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
12122 : It's crowded up front with # contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
12123 : It's crowded up front with all # contestants still fighting for the lead!
12124 : The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
12125 : What's this!?  has used %!
12126 : still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
12127 : is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
12128 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching  today!
12129 : What's this?  is making its move on the lead!
12130 : #:
12131 : What's this!? 's using [Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!
12132 : Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those [monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!
12133 : just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed! And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
12134 : I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about 's step.  And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!
12135 : And here's some unexpected drama, folks! The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
12136 : Look at that! 's stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!
12137 : Uh-oh, what's going on here!? The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
12138 : Oooh! In a bold move,  has just used a [Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!
12139 : What's this!? All of the chocobos other than  and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
12140 : Thanks to that brazen little act,  can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks! That just might seal the deal for !
12141 : Never in all my days, race fans! In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
12142 : How could my creation make such a rookie mistake? In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
12143 : Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
12144 : The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
12145 : The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
12146 : The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
12147 : Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!? What in the world do you think you're doing!?
12148 : Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame. This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
12149 : What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today? I've heard it being said that today's [creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal. This could get heavy, folks!
12150 : All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them. Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
12151 : It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
12152 : There's still plenty of race to go, race fans! More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
12153 : And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
12154 : The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now. This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
12155 : This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent. Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
12156 : And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty! Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
12157 : And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them! But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
12158 : I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call! Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
12159 : It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now! The time for a final spurt is now or never!
12160 : And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
12161 : It's here! It's here! The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!
12162 : If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!
12163 : Where would you like to go? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
12164 : See you again, kupo!
12165 : Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!
12166 : Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
12167 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
12168 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
12169 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
12170 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
12171 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
12172 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
12173 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
12174 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
12175 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
12176 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
12177 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
12178 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
12179 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
12180 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
12181 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
12182 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
12183 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
12184 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
12185 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
12186 : You can only carry one %.
12187 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
12188 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
12189 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
12190 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
12191 : You there. I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of part-time ghosts?
12192 : Have you heard? Yes, I've heard. Part-time ghosts!?
12193 : Then we may move on to more important matters.
12194 : We haven't been able to locate enough volunteers to participate in this year's festivities, and are searching for adventurers who would be willing to aid us.
12195 : All you will be required to do is dress up in one of these frightening costumes and wander about the city with the other specters.
12196 : <Sigh>... Then allow me to explain.
12197 : A memorial is currently being held in honor of a long-lost coven of witches known as the Dark Lilies.
12198 : During the memorial, volunteers dressed up as the witches and spirits walk a course about the city in honor of the deceased.
12199 : However, while we have filled all the spots for the witches, we are quite short on people willing to play the part of the monsters who follow the Lilies.
12200 : Would you be willing to lend a hand, fine [sir/lady]?
12201 : Will you help? Of course. Not a ghost of a chance.
12202 : Ah... How droll. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
12203 : Most excellent. There is one thing you must be aware of, however.
12204 : The witches have the most important role in this memorial service. You are to tread only in their wake. If it is found that you have stepped ahead of one of the Lilies, you will be asked to return your costume and leave the procession.
12205 : Though, we are a forgiving organization, and if you wish to participate once again, either speak with me or simply put on another costume and your request shall be granted.
12206 : Ah yes, and one more thing. There are two citizens playing the parts of the witches Guwanana and Bikho Ronpotteh.
12207 : You are to follow the fair Mithran maid dressed as Bikho. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.
12208 : Ah, welcome back, adventurer. You have done well. The Dark Lilies would be pleased.
12209 : Please take this as a token of our appreciation.
12210 : It is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.
12211 : Oh, and should you wish to aid us again, we would welcome your help. Many thanks, %.
12212 : What has befallen you? Do you wish to give up?
12213 : Give up? I'm done. Not yet.
12214 : A pity. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
12215 : You are to follow the young maiden dressed as Guwanana. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.
12216 : Good day! I suppose you've heard of all the people signing up to play ghosts in this year's festival, nay?
12217 : Have you heard? Yes, I've heard. Play ghosts!?
12218 : I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.
12219 : I'll get straight to the point, then. We need volunteers to dress up as ghosts, specters, wights, and the like, and walk around the city in honor of the Dark Lilies.
12220 : Would you be willing to participate? You will be rewarded nicely!
12221 : Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess. Let me give you the short version:
12222 : We're putting on a grand parade for this season's Harvest Festival.
12223 : We already have enough people to play the witches, but there can never be enough monsters, nay?
12224 : That's why we need volunteers like you to make the parade even more exciting. Oh, worry not, adventurer. You will be rewarded nicely!
12225 : Will you help? Of course. Not a ghost of a chance.
12226 : Oh... Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
12227 : Thank you! Now, there is one thing you should know...
12228 : The witches lead the procession. If you start getting any delusions of grandeur and work your way in front of the Lilies, you will be required to turn over your costume and forfeit all payment for services up to that point.
12229 : But that doesn't mean you can't try again! Just put on another costume and get back in line. I'm sure you'll get the hang of things soon enough.
12230 : Oh, and one more thing. There are two witches in this season's parade: Selma and Pretty Heart.
12231 : You're to be stationed in Selma's parade, so don't go wandering over to Pretty Heart's, hear me?
12232 : Good luck!
12233 : Excellent job, %! You've done the witches proud.
12234 : Here's the reward I promised.
12235 : It's a witch hat. The design matches those worn by the Dark Lilies. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.
12236 : Though, if you want to volunteer again, I'll be right here waiting for you!
12237 : Giving up the ghost, eh?
12238 : Oh... Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
12239 : You're to be stationed in Pretty Heart's parade, so don't go wandering over to Selma's, hear me?
12240 : Hi, I'm Gertrude. I'm helping with some of the Harvest Festival activities. Have you heard about our hiring policies?
12241 : Heard about them? Yes. Not at all.
12242 : You have? Well, that makes my job easier, then.
12243 : So, would you like to sign up for the Procession of the Lilies?
12244 : No? Then let me fill you in on the details. We are currently holding a memorial for the Dark Lilies, in which two women dressed as members of the lost coven lead a party of spirits around the city.
12245 : There is a shortage of volunteers for the witches' undead followers, and I was wondering if you would like to help.
12246 : Sign up? Right away! Not today.
12247 : Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard. Please come back if you change your mind.
12248 : Wonderful. There are just two more things I must warn you of, however.
12249 : First and foremost, during the procession, the witches are boss, so don't even think of stepping in front of them. If you do, your costume will be immediately confiscated.
12250 : Ah, but if that happens, you need not worry. Just put on another costume and try again!
12251 : Secondly, there are two witches in the city--Maryse and Poseaulloie.
12252 : You are to join with Poseaulloie's congregation.
12253 : Good luck!
12254 : How did you fare...? Was the witch pleased?
12255 : Either way, your help has been invaluable. Would you accept this in appreciation?
12256 : It's a witch hat. Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...
12257 : Though, if you have time, we would gladly accept your help again.
12258 : What's wrong? Have you grown tired of your duties?
12259 : Oh, I see... Well, please return to me if you find your patience for them restored.
12260 : You are to join with Maryse's congregation.
12261 : I shall let you know when there is another opening.
12262 : I'll let you know when a spot opens up.
12263 : You'll be the first to know when I have a new opening.
12264 : Ooops! You've stepped in front of the witch!
12265 : You can't stop now. You've just started!
12266 : You've only just begun.
12267 : There's still a long way to go.
12268 : Hope you didn't make any other plans, because you're not even close to being finished.
12269 : Almost halfway...
12270 : It's still a little too early to go back.
12271 : Leave the procession now and someone might be peeved.
12272 : Just a little longer...
12273 : You're almost done!
12274 : Alright! It's time to collect your reward!
12275 : You've joined the procession.
12276 : Adventurer! Adventurer!
12277 : Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand? Sure! Doing what? Not today.
12278 : A thousand thanks, kupo! Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!
12279 : Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend! All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the cyclopean crystals located about the strongholds, kupo!
12280 : Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?
12281 : You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.
12282 : Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.
12283 : It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces' victory over the beastmen armies?
12284 : And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...
12285 : However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.
12286 : And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!
12287 : By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!
12288 : One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.
12289 : We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.
12290 : Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...
12291 : ...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.
12292 : The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's Most Valuable Nation and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.
12293 : So, what do you say, kupo? I'm in. Maybe later.
12294 : Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!
12295 : Kupopo...
12296 : Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...
12297 : My records show that you have brought your nation a total of # [shard/shards], but I know you're not done yet, are you?
12298 : Amazing! You've already collected # [shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!
12299 : Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!
12300 : Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those [San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!
12301 : Congratulations on your victory, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!
12302 : Where would like to go, kupo? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
12303 : Happy travels, kupo!
12304 : Moogles from across Vana'diel have heard of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!
12305 : Oooh! It's %! Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!
12306 : ***GM Commands*** ***Use with CAUTION!***
12307 : Set this area's A flag to: Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
12308 : Switch on this area's B flag? No (OFF). Yes (ON).
12309 : Flag settings complete. A Flag: [Nowhere/San/Bas/Win] B Flag: [OFF/ON]
12310 : The Starlight Celebration is here again, kupo!
12311 : And once again, we have a pile of presents for all the adventurers!
12312 : But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo... There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...
12313 : Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!
12314 : I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom. All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!
12315 : We're counting on you, kupo!
12316 : The recipient for this present was supposed to be [level 37 or lower/level 38 or higher].
12317 : And I'm pretty sure we were looking for [a male Hume/a female Hume/a male Elvaan/a female Elvaan/a male Tarutaru/a female Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka].
12318 : Someone who was trained as [a warrior/a monk/a white mage/a black mage/a red mage/a thief/a paladin/a dark knight/a beastmaster/a bard/a ranger/a samurai/a ninja/a dragoon/a summoner/a blue mage/a corsair/a puppetmaster/a dancer/a scholar]...
12319 : If you're having trouble finding the person we're looking for, it's okay to give up for now, kupo.
12320 : Give up for now? That would be best. Not just yet!
12321 : Yeah, that's a tough one, kupo. But I have plenty of other presents here if you'd still like to help!
12322 : Hmmm...I don't think this is the person we're looking for, kupo.
12323 : Hmmm...this isn't the person we're looking for, kupo. But, you know what? I think something's coming back to me...
12324 : Oh, I stumbled across the present that was meant for the adventurer you brought with you, kupo!
12325 : Presents can be claimed using a card just like this! Have your adventurer friend show the card to a moogle and receive a wonderful gift, kupo!
12326 : Yes! This is the person I was looking for, kupo!
12327 : Hand this card to your friend. It can be given to a moogle in exchange for a present, kupo!
12328 : Your help was invaluable! Here, this is for you, kupo!
12329 : There are still so many presents to hand out, kupo! Don't be shy about lending another helping hand!
12330 : I'm so glad we found you! Here's your present, kupo!
12331 : What are you trying to pull, kupo!? Give this card to the person it's addressed to, and have them come to a moogle to receive a present!
12332 : One card at a time! I'm confused enough as it is, kupo!
12333 : I remember 20 years ago when I was in charge of protecting Galkan Bridge from the beastmen.
12334 : For a large part of the Crystal War, we had her blocked off on both sides. The government said it was to keep enemy spies from infiltrating Bastok's central areas. However, there were rumors that it was to prevent Galka from coming over on this side of the river and rioting.
12335 : It would be a lie if I told you it wasn't hard for me, a Galka, to work against my brothers like that.
12336 : I still have nightmares about the times I had to force back groups of refugees trying to escape the flames that engulfed their homes in the mines district.
12337 : And now I'm back here patrolling the bridge as I did so long ago. Perhaps destiny has a tighter grip on us than I thought...
12338 : That young'n has been waiting there for her friend for quite a stretch. I wonder what the holdup is.
12339 : Ida must not like me anymore. That's it, we're through!
12340 : Why don't you wait just a little more? I'm sure your friend has been delayed for some reason.
12341 : How do you know that?
12342 : When I was a little girl, I had a friend just like you.
12343 : She always believed in me. That's why I was able to become the chef I am today.
12344 : You should believe in your friend, as well. Think how terrible it would be to lose her over some silly misunderstanding.
12345 : Hmm, I guess you're right. Ida would never break her word on purpose. I'll wait a little bit longer!
12346 : Bruna!
12347 : Ida! There you are!
12348 : I'm sorry I'm late! My mother wouldn't let me out until I'd finished all my chores...
12349 : It's okay. C'mon, let's go play!
12350 : Bye!
12351 : So sweet...
12352 : I was pretty hard on you, wasn't I?
12353 : And I've been overly strict with Leonhardt, as well. That was no way for a mentor to act...
12354 : I owe it to Karla to be the best chef that I can be.
12355 : And I have you to thank for bringing me to my senses.
12356 : It's not much, but I baked you this pie to show my appreciation and apologize for my harsh words. I hope you can forgive me.
12357 : Well, I'm glad that little one's friend came along at last.
12358 : You know, I seem to recall a time when another little girl used to wait here. I wonder if she ever managed to catch up with her friend...
12359 : Haaahhh, another squandered day. I probably should have gone to work...
12360 : Oh... You heard that, huh? Hey, don't you judge me! I have a perfectly good reason for skipping work today.
12361 : Do you know what a Bastokan Time Capsule is?
12362 : It's when you and a group of friends all write letters to yourselves and place them in a box, which you then bury somewhere safe. It was a playful tradition we had around here during the dark days of the war to give us a little hope.
12363 : Actually, some friends of mine and I put one together a long time ago. I went to dig it up recently, since I was the one in charge of burying it.
12364 : But when I found it, the box had been ravaged and its contents plundered. Cursed goblins, no doubt.
12365 : I would like to have known what hopes I had for the future back then. Caught in the drudgery of the daily routine, every day the same thing over and over... I just would like to have known.
12366 : All the others were so looking forward to reading their letters. I can't even bring myself to look them in the eye. It's all my fault for choosing such a terrible spot to bury it.
12367 : I was devastated when I found our time capsule. Battered and empty... Those goblins are the scourge of this world!
12368 : A while back I went to dig up our letters but realized I had totally forgotten where they were buried. After that I totally lost the will to work...
12369 : A while back I went to dig up our capsule, but found that it had been discovered and raided by goblins. There wasn't a single letter left to be found...
12370 : We even went so far as to cover up the burial spot with a large rock. What more could we do? It looked like the goblins just tossed it aside like a pebble.
12371 : If only we had put % in the capsule as well. Maybe that would have diverted their attention away from the letters...
12372 : Those confounded goblins! What I wouldn't give...
12373 : Not too long ago I went to dig up the box we buried containing our letters and found it lying above ground, empty. It looks like the goblins found it after all, just as I feared.
12374 : It occurred to me to put % in the box to draw the goblins' attention away from the letters. But it seems they left the lid open and the letters just blew away.
12375 : A false-bottom box... That would have worked. Why do I always think of these things after the fact?
12376 : ......
12377 : I really am a no-good fool...
12378 : I finally went and retrieved the letters my friends and I had written to ourselves all those years ago. Can you guess what my letter said?
12379 : Don't ask me. It's up to you. That's what I wrote.
12380 : All the others had written such beautiful letters, full of the hope we were seeking during the war. I want to be a valiant soldier. I want to be a gifted doctor who saves many lives. Everyone else had dreams...everyone but me.
12381 : I had no hopes or aspirations. I couldn't think of anything to write. So I just put it off and delayed making a decision for as long as possible...
12382 : Back then I thought for sure that in the future I would be pursuing a noble dream, sure of myself at every step...
12383 : And now look at me. Still with no dreams and just waiting for some kind of guidance from a letter I wrote so long ago... I haven't changed a bit.
12384 : Well, that's all going to change from now on! M-my not changing, that is...
12385 : Well, thanks for taking the time to listen to my woes. I'm sorry, but I have only this to offer you in gratitude.
12386 : Wow! I never knew rolanberries could be so delicious! I feel like I've wasted my life having never known such flavor!
12387 : Work? How can you talk about working at a time like this!? I'm eating here!
12388 : It sure was the right call to bury those %. Look, I even had the foresight to bury two! Here you go. You can have one, free of charge.
12389 : The time capsule? Oh, yes--I already made sure that everyone got their letter.
12390 : I wonder where my letter got to... To be honest, I couldn't care less. Who needs dreams when you have % as scrumptious as this! Mmm-mmm!
12391 : Have you heard about those ghastly statues they're calling maws?
12392 : They're like carvings of some monster with a huge, open mouth. Rumors say that if you stand in front of one, you feel like your soul is being devoured...
12393 : Huh? You want me to pass this to Valeriano next time he's here?
12394 : I certainly don't mind, but it looks like it won't be necessary. Look--
12395 : Good day, Harmodios. I'm here with regard to the music sheets I requested the other day...
12396 : They're ready just like you asked, sir.  By the way, this young [gentleman/lady] here...
12397 : Ah yes, I remember. You're a dancer from Troupe Brilioth, are you not? How may I be of service?
12398 : Absolutely splendid! Nothing would give me more pleasure than to perform with Troupe Brilioth!
12399 : How I've longed to see...
12400 : A-ahem. I will deliver the news to my troupe and have them prepare immediately. They are sure to be as excited as I am!
12401 : I will see you again very soon. Please send my regards to Laila.
12402 : A collaboration of circus and dance, huh? Now that's something I haven't seen since my childhood, before Troupe Valeriano disbanded after that unfortunate fire...
12403 : Hello, how may I help you?
12404 : Oh, a dancer, are you? Which troupe did you say you're from?
12405 : Wh-wh-what!? From Troupe Brilioth!? Laila's Troupe Brilioth!?
12406 : I am green with envy! I've been Laila's biggest fan for the past twenty years!
12407 : You see, I'd dabbled in dancing once in the past. Unfortunately though, the powers that be didn't see it fit to bless me with rhythm...
12408 : They did, however, bless me with these tailor's hands that can whip up garments that adorn their wearer with joy and happiness.
12409 : I'm sorry for rambling like that. You came here to place an order, right?
12410 : Let me see...  I can make you %, %, and %.
12411 : Which will you have made? %. %. %. Nothing.
12412 : Not interested? Feel free to come back anytime you need something.
12413 : In order to make %, I need %, and %. Oh, and also %.
12414 : Sounds doable? No problem. No...
12415 : Alright then, bring me the materials and I'll get started.
12416 : In order to make %, I need %, %, and %.
12417 : Let's take a look at what you brought me... %, %, and %. Good! They're exactly what I need to make %.
12418 : I'll start working on it right away. This will take time, so please come back later.
12419 : I'm working as fast as I can, but it will take a bit more time. Good things come to those who wait, right?
12420 : Fantastic timing! I just finished making your %.
12421 : Won't you look at that shine? It accentuates that glimmer of determination in your eyes.
12422 : What do you think? Its soft, yet vibrant color truly complements your full, red lips.
12423 : Now, no one could possibly keep their eyes off your performances!
12424 : How do you like this exquisite harmony between black and gold? Only the most skilled of craftsmen can achieve such balance.
12425 : Now, your dance will shine like never before!
12426 : The beauty of these shoes is hidden in the soles which are designed to achieve just the right pitch and timbre.
12427 : They will enrich your dance by adding an extra dimension to your steps, all without being obtrusive.
12428 : Let me know if there is anything else you want made.
12429 : Well, that's the last garment I can make for you. Please give my regards to Laila!
12430 : I'm afraid there's nothing else I can make for you. Please give my regards to Laila!
12431 : Would you like to have something made?
12432 : I specialize in tailoring for entertainers and dancers. I'm proud of the countless garments I've tailored over the years.
12433 : This year's Sunbreeze Festival has begun! A special show is being held at the town square as we speak, kupo!

12447 : If all their fanatical fans' hearts were to beat as one, the tide of battle would surely turn in the Mighty Maidens' favor, kupo!

12450 : Your lovely lasses--the Mighty Maidens--were scheduled to sings songs with some studly strangers known as the Dashing Dreamers the whole lovely week...but cruel circumstance connived to charm our cherubs!
12451 : Those masculine models have mesmerized Uka and Mumor with their magnetic mannerisms!
12452 : Only the preserving puissance of the performers' passionate patrons can possibly penetrate this palpably pernicious pickle! So clap, cheer, and go crazy for Foudeel so he can cleanse this cacodemonic curse!
12453 : Endeavor to erase this epidemic by mimicking the moves of Foudeel and his fabulous friends when they unleash the Dancing Force!
12454 : Defeat the dastardly duo and haul our heroines hither! I shall supply stupendous spoils to the stalwarts who save our singers!
12455 : In this most fantastic of shows, help the Mighty Maiden Mumor knock Uka Totlihn out of Ullegore's thrall!

12459 : This is the prize we prepared for you. Come back and participate again anytime you want, kupo!
12460 : We've also procured something perfect for you in the form of %, kupo!
12461 : The stage is set at Qu'Bia Arena! Enjoy this new additional event and receive something beyond your wildest dreams!
12462 : Wow! Your outstanding assistance makes you today's MVP!
12463 : Here is your prize as promised! Wearing it will earnestly enhance your festive mood, kupo!
12464 : The Mighty Maidens informed me of the substantially superior succor you supplied them against that despicable Diva. Once again, I thank you for thwarting her twisted theatrics, kupo!
12465 : Here is your prize as promised! Wearing it will earnestly enhance your festive mood, kupo!
12466 : You displayed dynamism and dignity in doing your duty! All Vana'diel is grateful for your gumption and gusto!
12467 : Your tremendous trust and fantastic friendship showed that not even the devious Diva could break the bond between you and Mumor! Here--a ravishing reward for your efforts!
12468 : Kupopo? You need to have at least # free space[/s] in your inventory to receive your reward! Come back after sorting out your bags.
12469 : The magnificent Mumor mentioned your exciting exploits, kupo! Thanks for showing everyone a good time!
12470 : As promised, here's your extra-special reward!
12471 : Kupopo!? Did you get those three balloons by playing festival games!?
12472 : You completely cleared hard mode! That's incredible, kupo!
12473 : Your flair for all things festive is a fine example to us all! I bestow upon you this most excellent of exceptional prizes, kupo!
12474 : To reward your readiness to rollick, I present you this %! Keep the sweltering summer heat at bay with this snazzy little number, kupo!
12475 : Greetings and well met! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
12476 : Greetings and well met! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
12477 : Greetings and well met! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service.
12478 : My station is to help along those new to the life of an adventurer in Vana'diel. I specialize in the types of fundamental knowledge necessary for success in such endeavors, as well as related methods of pedagogy. With my aid, you can rest assured that your first steps down the adventurer's path will not go astray.
12479 : Should you still consider yourself a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you make full use of my services.
12480 : This is my permanent post, and I never leave it. Remember it well. Whenever you need a hand with anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to come calling.
12481 : So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness? Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!
12482 : Go talk to the guard Aravoge just over yonder and have him cast Signet on you. Then come back and see me.
12483 : Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast Signet on you. Then come back and see me.
12484 : Go talk to the guard Harara over yonder and have her cast Signet on you. Then come back and see me.
12485 : Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?
12486 : As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat. There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.
12487 : Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest. For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.
12488 : Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these %.
12489 : There is more here than meats the eye! That was a joke... Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a meal. This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.
12490 : Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus. Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.
12491 : For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power. Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth. Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.
12492 : One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect. Your stomach would simply burst!
12493 : Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover... Are you with me so far?
12494 : So far so good? Explain Signet again. Explain meals again. This is a breeze.
12495 : Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it. Go ahead and pop one of those %!
12496 : After eating a meal, a status icon designated as Food will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen. Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.
12497 : Check out the full belly on you! Well done! Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy. This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!
12498 : Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty! No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!
12499 : Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.
12500 : Try to target one of the monsters and then select the Check option from your menu. This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks [his/her] fights.
12501 : Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as very tough or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.
12502 : And that brings us to your next assignment!
12503 : It's high time you learned how to use a weapon skill!
12504 : Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your skills will rise little by little.
12505 : When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.
12506 : Combo for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. Wasp Sting for those who fight with daggers. Fast Blade for those who prefer the sword.
12507 : Shining Strike for wielders of the club. Heavy Swing for those who take up the staff. And on, and on, and on...
12508 : Selecting Status from the main menu will bring up the Combat Skl. option. This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.
12509 : The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5. So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!
12510 : Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't [he/she]? Very good!
12511 : I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more. Whenever your Tactical Points (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting Abilities and then Weapon Skl. from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.
12512 : These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies. It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.
12513 : Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?
12514 : If you were lucky enough to come across any %, make sure you hang onto them. They may pay dividends later on...
12515 : Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later. The items you will no doubt come across known as crystals, such as % and %, are extremely significant.
12516 : They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes. These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.
12517 : For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in synthesis.
12518 : But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then. %, %, and last but not least, %.
12519 : Now, using % will bring up the synthesis interface. Once there, select the % and % as the ingredients to be added.
12520 : All that remains is to select the OK option, and the synthesis will commence!
12521 : You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe. Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.
12522 : The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the Auction House for sale.
12523 : The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.
12524 : My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house. One simply must see it with one's own eyes.
12525 : Are you still with me? Explain synthesis again. Explain the auction house again. Sure am.
12526 : Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.
12527 : You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase. Simply examining any of the Auction Counters will more than suffice.
12528 : So, you were able to locate the auction house! Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?
12529 : What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale. It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.
12530 : And now down to brass tacks! Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!
12531 : There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.
12532 : For example, there are %, %, and %, just to name a few.
12533 : These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.
12534 : There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again. The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.
12535 : Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet. You need only exchange Conquest Points in order to acquire them.
12536 : As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this %. With this, you'll be able to obtain % without having to use any of your Conquest Points.
12537 : Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something. And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four. I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.
12538 : With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all. Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!
12539 : Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet! Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.
12540 : A bit of bad news now, though. Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.
12541 : As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level. You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!
12542 : However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.
12543 : Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four. It's called %.
12544 : Using this will grant you a status known as Reraise. Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.
12545 : Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen. In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.
12546 : % and similar items work in the same manner as the % and the other experience bonus items I mentioned earlier. That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.
12547 : All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as enchanted items. There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures. It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.
12548 : It seems you're starting to get the hang of things. Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].
12549 : [La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the [southern/northern/northern] reaches of [West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].
12550 : You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city. It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.
12551 : Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be. Don't say I didn't warn you.
12552 : Make sure to use the Check command to determine the strength of your enemy. If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.
12553 : I know those smells... You smell of victory! And of [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, %.
12554 : But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?
12555 : If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a too weak to be worthwhile result.
12556 : Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.
12557 : If you start to notice more and more of these too weak monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.
12558 : Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime! You've just earned yourself # experience points, hotshot.
12559 : Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!
12560 : I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, %. But it's for your own good. I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.
12561 : Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city. You're more than capable of besting monsters in [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.
12562 : I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world. Time to put some money in those pockets. A #-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.
12563 : By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?
12564 : But don't go getting too cocky! This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!
12565 : Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation. I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.
12566 : For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.
12567 : Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius. You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.
12568 : There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being. Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.
12569 : And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points. The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.
12570 : Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.
12571 : I want you to travel once again to [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a Gate Crystal.
12572 : Near the center of [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the [Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].
12573 : There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as Telepoints. Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.
12574 : Only when you present your % to me shall your assignment be complete.
12575 : Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting. And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.
12576 : This shall be your final assignment. Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.
12577 : Ahhh, the %, just as I requested. Excellent work, %.
12578 : And now for some information regarding this little beauty. As long as you have this %, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.
12579 : I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.
12580 : Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel. Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.
12581 : Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, %! You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.
12582 : And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of # experience points, and # %.
12583 : I fear that I have nothing more to teach you. From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.
12584 : Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.
12585 : Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others. It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.
12586 : I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so. It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.
12587 : There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on. Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again. I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.
12588 : Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, %.
12589 : Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service. Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?
12590 : Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service. Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?
12591 : Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service.. Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?
12592 : What will you ask about? Nothing just now. Search comments. Skillchains. Magic bursts. Skillchains and elements.
12593 : Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.
12594 : There are several different categories of search comments. These include, but are not limited to, EXP Party, Items, and Missions and Quests.
12595 : Opening the Search function from the Main Menu and then selecting the Comment option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.
12596 : For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select EXP Party from the list displayed.
12597 : Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the Edit Comment command from the Search menu.
12598 : Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person. You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.
12599 : Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order.
12600 : The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.
12601 : To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill Red Lotus Blade immediately after Fast Blade will yield a type of skillchain known as Liquefaction.
12602 : Furthermore, adding a Combo after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced Fusion skillchain.
12603 : In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements. Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.
12604 : Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.
12605 : One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning. It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.
12606 : The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated. It is said of this time-tested battle art that it takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.
12607 : Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy. You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as MB.
12608 : Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.
12609 : To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.
12610 : In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.
12611 : As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.
12612 : The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.
12613 : For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.
12614 : Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element): Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind), Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water), Scission (Earth), Compression (Darkness).
12615 : Level 2 Skillchain (Associated elements): Fusion (Light/Fire), Fragmentation (Wind/Thunder), Distortion (Ice/Water), Gravitation (Earth/Darkness).
12616 : Level 3 Skillchain (Associated elements): Light (Light/Fire/Wind/Thunder), Darkness (Ice/Water/Earth/Darkness).
12617 : Kupo ho ho! The Starlight Celebration is once again upon us!
12618 : We moogles have spent many a sleepless night preparing for this year's festivities, kupo. Be sure not to miss any of the exceptionally exciting events that are being held in and about town during this most joyous of seasons.
12619 : Oh, and there's one thing you simply must know, kupo. Should you come by any gift tokens, bring them to me and I'll furnish you with gorgeous gifts in exchange!
12620 : Now, run along and immerse yourself in the revelry, kupo!
12621 : Ah, you've brought %! Here, this is for you!
12622 : Wow! That's quite a few gift tokens you have there, kupo!
12623 : If you're interested, I can exchange all the tokens you have for a grand gift of galactic proportion, kupo! Well, perhaps that's exaggerating things a tad.
12624 : Of course, it's perfectly permissible to use them one at time. The decision is entirely yours, kupo!
12625 : How many tokens will you exchange? The whole kaboodle! I'm a miser. Just the one, please.
12626 : That's the spirit, kupo! Here's a super-duper special gift for the [man/woman] who dared!
12627 : Sure thing, kupo. Here, this is your % in exchange.
12628 : Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight! As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for everyone, kupo.
12629 : For this year's Starlight Celebration, we moogles have set ourselves a challenge: breaking the all-Vana'diel present-distribution record! But we couldn't possibly dream of succeeding at such an ambitious undertaking just by ourselves, kupo.
12630 : We could really do with some adventurer-offered assistance. Would you be interested in lending a hand in this noble endeavor, in the spirit of giving, kupo?
12631 : Help the moogles? Sign me up! I'm a little busy, sorry.
12632 : We understand... But we'll be waiting right here if it turns out you can spare some time after all, kupo!
12633 : You've made this little moogle very happy, kupo! Now then, let's not waste any time. We'd like you to deliver these presents here.
12634 : Report back to us after you've completed your task, kupo.
12635 : Also, we don't mind you working in a group if you feel lonesome doing the deliveries on your own. Just form a party and have everyone come talk to us.
12636 : And I have to warn you, presents can't be taken to other areas, kupo. Be careful, okay?
12637 : Happy delivering, kupo!
12638 : Wow, you've delivered every single present! Thank you so much, kupo!
12639 : Here's a little something for your kindness.
12640 : You want to help us again? That's very kind of you, but we need more time to put together a new set of presents, kupo. Would you mind coming back tomorrow?
12641 : Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight! As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for all adventurers, kupo.
12642 : We'd appreciate your help in distributing the presents. What say you?
12643 : Help the moogles? But of course! I help no one but myself.
12644 : You're truly a role model for all adventurers, kupo! Now then, we'd like you to take this card and give it to a [male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer.
12645 : If you happen to forget who the card's recipient is, just show it to me, kupo.
12646 : Let' see... This addressee of this card is a [male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer, kupo.
12647 : Are you trying to pull a fast one, kupo!? This card isn't yours to give, nor is it addressed to you, so please take it back to where you found it.
12648 : Ah, you've brought us a card! Here's a present in exchange for it, kupo.
12649 : We'd also appreciate your help in distributing cards, kupo. All you're required to do is deliver this card to the addressee. We're counting on you!
12650 : Things have settled down for the time being. But we may have need for your help later on, so don't wander too far away, kupo.
12651 : Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
12652 : I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain %.
12653 : Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
12654 : May I be of service? Not now. Learn recipes. Check fewell. Replenish fewell. Purchase materials. Receive training. Trade cinder. Get information.
12655 : Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
12656 : ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
12657 : I've got it! How about %? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...
12658 : Synergy skill: [Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice/Journeyman/Craftsman/Artisan/Adept/Veteran].

12676 : There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
12677 : But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your % for a moment...
12678 : Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: # # # # # # # #.
12679 : Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
12680 : Replenish fewell? Yes. No.
12681 : Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
12682 : ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
12683 : Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for # gil.  How does that sound?
12684 : Pay # gil? Deal! No thanks.
12685 : Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
12686 : I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
12687 : Excellent! Now we just pop open your % here, and...
12688 : There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
12689 : Your % has been filled to capacity!
12690 : You hand the synergy engineer # gil.
12691 : How do you expect me to do that when your % is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
12692 : Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
12693 : Purchase something? Not today. # %: # gil. # ): # gil. # ): # gil.
12694 : For # %, that comes to # gil.
12695 : Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
12696 : ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
12697 : And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
12698 : Train in which technique? Cancel. Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: #) Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: #) Safety lever. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: #) Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: #)
12699 : You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
12700 : It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
12701 : Train in this technique? Yes. No.
12702 : Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
12703 : ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
12704 : ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
12705 : ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
12706 : <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
12707 : ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
12708 : Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level #!
12709 : Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
12710 : Trade in your cinder? (Currently: # Pz) Not now. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. # gil: # Pz.
12711 : This is what you want, correct?
12712 : Make the exchange? Yes. No.
12713 : It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
12714 : Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
12715 : You transferred # Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. # Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
12716 : Ask about what? Nothing. Synergy furnaces. Synergy overview. Synergy procedure. Synergy recipes. Fewell replenishment. Materials for sale. Synergy techniques. Trading cinder.
12717 : The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
12718 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
12719 : Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
12720 : Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
12721 : You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
12722 : Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
12723 : This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call fewell. To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
12724 : As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
12725 : With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
12726 : The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
12727 : But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
12728 : If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
12729 : Take heart, though, as any materials inside your % will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
12730 : Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
12731 : Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
12732 : Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
12733 : You may be asking yourself, Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?
12734 : Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
12735 : The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
12736 : Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of %, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
12737 : Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that % may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
12738 : Mind you, % is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
12739 : Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
12740 : First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
12741 : You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
12742 : Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
12743 : You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
12744 : From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
12745 : Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
12746 : Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
12747 : However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
12748 : If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
12749 : You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
12750 : The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
12751 : It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
12752 : This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
12753 : As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
12754 : For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
12755 : You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
12756 : In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
12757 : Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
12758 : If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
12759 : Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
12760 : What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
12761 : The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
12762 : ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
12763 : Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
12764 : Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
12765 : Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
12766 : The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
12767 : In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as % can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
12768 : % cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of % can then be embedded.
12769 : The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
12770 : If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
12771 : As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
12772 : You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
12773 : Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
12774 : My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
12775 : The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
12776 : Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
12777 : To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
12778 : When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
12779 : Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
12780 : Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
12781 : As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call fewell. The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
12782 : Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
12783 : To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
12784 : For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
12785 : That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your %! What could be easier?
12786 : Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of %? If so, you've come to the right place!
12787 : We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
12788 : Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
12789 : Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
12790 : Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
12791 : My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
12792 : Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
12793 : Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
12794 : Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
12795 : The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
12796 : Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
12797 : Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
12798 : We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
12799 : It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
12800 : Wondering if your % can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
12801 : A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
12802 : Congratulations! Your % can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A %-shaped aperture, to be exact...
12803 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: # / [///////].
12804 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
12805 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
12806 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
12807 : That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
12808 : Hmm... I'm afraid your % cannot house any more apertures.
12809 : ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your % cannot be etched.
12810 : Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your % cannot be etched at this time.
12811 : Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

12815 : Oh, the %? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
12816 : Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
12817 : Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
12818 : Learn about synergy? Not today. Teach me! Just give me %.
12819 : A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
12820 : I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
12821 : Using % in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
12822 : What we call % serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
12823 : Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
12824 : Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your % into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
12825 : Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
12826 : Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
12827 : You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
12828 : But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
12829 : A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
12830 : That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
12831 : An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for %, you've certainly come to the right place.
12832 : I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for # gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
12833 : # gil, paid in full!
12834 : As promised, here's your %. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
12835 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
12836 : Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
12837 : Capacity-challenged adventurers, come one, come all, kupo! The Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has developed the supreme solution for your storage woes!
12838 : Ah, another adventurer has arrived to take advantage of world-renowned moogle altruism and artisanship! Rest assured that you will not depart disappointed, my friend.
12839 : Feast your eyes on the stylish, fashionable Mog Sack!
12840 : Why, it's the perfect union of form and function! Who could ask for more, kupo?
12841 : What's more, its carrying capacity can be customized to meet its owner's needs. Greedaloxes and Grand Greedaloxes haven't seen anything like this!
12842 : And it can be yours--yes, yours!--for the low, low price of only # gil! Why, that's # gil off the moogle manufacturer's suggested retail price.
12843 : That's right, we at the MHMU don't care how far into debt we go this time! Why, I personally would starve to death in the streets of San d'Oria to free adventurers the world over from inventory frustration! So how about it, kupo?
12844 : Kupo? (Current gil: #) Buy a mog sack. (# gil) Expand your mog sack. About mog sacks. About expansion. Do nothing.
12845 : I'm sorry, kupo. Our special-order mog sacks are limited to one per adventurer.
12846 : Transaction complete, kupo! Say goodbye to days of rummaging through your gobbiebag, and hello to a life of haute hupoture, because you are now the proud owner of a spectacular, snazzy, state-of-the-art mog sack!
12847 : We go through such pains for you adventurers, and you would try to procure our products without sufficient funds, kupo? Will you not be content until every last moogle is in the poorhouse!? <Sniff>...<sob>...
12848 : Oh dear! I almost forgot the most important part, kupo!
12849 : Looking to expand your mog sack? You've come to the right place, kupo!
12850 : A little dose of moogle magic, and...voila, kupo! Your mog sack can now hold an incredible [/35/40/45/50/55/60/65/70/75/80] items!
12851 : You hear the disconcerting sound of fabric being stretched to its limits...
12852 : There you go, kupo! And with that, it looks like I've enlarged your mog sack as far as it will go.
12853 : A ripping sound? I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about, kupo. My, oh my, that's one stupendous mog sack you've got there!
12854 : I'm afraid your mog sack has already been enlarged to its limits. We wouldn't want to have any...fabric malfunctions, would we, kupo?
12855 : I'm afraid your mog sack has reached its limits. Your gobbiebag, on the other hand, looks like it could still be tailored up in the right hands.
12856 : The mog sack is a marvel of modern moogle craftsmanship, imbued with moogle magic that allows its capacity to be increased proportional to the size of your gobbiebag!
12857 : How does that work, you ask? Let's just call it a moogle and Gobbie mystery! Kupohohoho!
12858 : Ah, yes. And for being such a valued customer, here's a special present from the MHMU to you! Truly, our benevolence knows no bounds, kupo!
12859 : Sack storage space: # Gobbiebag storage space: expanded to [30/35/40/45/50/55/60/65/70/75/80] .
12860 : Processing: #
12861 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
12862 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
12863 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
12864 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
12865 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
12866 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
12867 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
12868 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
12869 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
12870 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
12871 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
12872 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
12873 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
12874 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
12875 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
12876 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
12877 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
12878 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
12879 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
12880 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
12881 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
12882 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
12883 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?

12897 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
12898 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
12899 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
12900 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
12901 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
12902 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.

12913 : Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.
12914 : Those who possess % may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused. Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.
12915 : Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
12916 : I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
12917 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Have stratum abyssite examined. Request teleportation. Analyze atmacite. Ask about atmacite. Ask about atmacite enrichment.
12918 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.

12923 : [Infuse/Purge] which atmacite? None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#)
12924 : Purge % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
12925 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with % (lv.#)!
12926 : The atmacite could not be infused...
12927 : % has been purged of the % (lv.#).
12928 : % purges the % (lv.#), infusing % (lv.#) in its place. (Cruor expended: #)
12929 : You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.

12931 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
12932 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
12933 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
12934 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
12935 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
12936 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
12937 : The atmacite could not be purged...
12938 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
12939 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
12940 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
12941 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
12942 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
12943 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
12944 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
12945 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
12946 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
12947 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
12948 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
12949 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
12950 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
12951 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
12952 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
12953 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12954 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
12955 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
12956 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
12957 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
12958 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
12959 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
12960 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
12961 : Your % has evolved into %!
12962 : Supply me with the # cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.

13697 : I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the [Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana]. My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.
13698 : I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.
13699 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Ask a bunch of questions. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
13700 : While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess % may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
13701 : The % is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.
13702 : Enlisted in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s armed forces, you say? Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.
13703 : I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
13704 : While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel. Come back again once you have proven your worth.
13705 : You must be at least level # to participate in Voidwatch.
13706 : Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!
13707 : I see you've yet to be issued %. Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.
13708 : Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.
13709 : You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or jurisdiction.
13710 : Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.
13711 : While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with %.
13712 : Operations are presently underway at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
13713 : Operations are presently underway at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
13714 : Operations are presently underway at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
13715 : It would seem some other requirement exists besides the usual % and %.
13716 : Rest assured, you will be apprised of this information as soon as we acquire it.
13717 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].
13718 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg].
13719 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo].
13720 : When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension. The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.
13721 : Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!
13722 : Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.
13723 : The % you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.
13724 : You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
13725 : Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts. This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.
13726 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
13727 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
13728 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
13729 : Operations are currently underway [in the greater Jeuno region/in the three nations]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
13730 : Ah, I daresay your % has undergone change!
13731 : How many would you like? None. Just one. Fill me up!
13732 : Here is your additional % allocation. Make each and every one count, you hear?
13733 : It appears you already possess the maximum allocation of # stones. I'm not authorized to provision you with more.
13734 : I'm afraid we're out of stock. The next shipment is expected to arrive in # [minute/minutes] (Earth time).
13735 : Obtained key item: # %!
13736 : Obtained key item: # %!
13737 : Your outstanding allocation of %? My records tell me you have # to your name.
13738 : Exchange for what? (Cruor: #) Nothing right now. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #.
13739 : # cruor is required for %.
13740 : # cruor is required for the %.
13741 : Proceed? (Required Cruor: #) Yes. No.
13742 : It seems you do not have enough cruor.
13743 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for %!
13744 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for the %!
13745 : Hm? It seems you already possess %. In that case, you won't be needing another.
13746 : This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.
13747 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.
13748 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.
13749 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.
13750 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.
13751 : A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.
13752 : A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.
13753 : A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
13754 : What will you ask about? Nothing. The Voidwalker threat. How I can do my part. The Voidwatch. Voidwatchers. Ascent items. Riftworn pyxides. %. Stratum abyssite. Planar rifts. Cruor. Abyssite. Voidstone consumption.
13755 : Voidwalker is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.
13756 : Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.
13757 : While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.
13758 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.
13759 : As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.
13760 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.
13761 : To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.
13762 : Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.
13763 : Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.
13764 : Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought. Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.
13765 : These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team. They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.
13766 : Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.
13767 : The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to # stones per person at any given time.
13768 : That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.
13769 : The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call Voidwalkers.
13770 : Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.
13771 : Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.
13772 : Possession of % is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
13773 : It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.
13774 : You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.
13775 : Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
13776 : In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.
13777 : The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.
13778 : When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.
13779 : Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.
13780 : However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.
13781 : Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.
13782 : Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.
13783 : But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the existential spectrum.
13784 : You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned. In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.
13785 : The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.
13786 : To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.
13787 : Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
13788 : Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.
13789 : One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items, while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.
13790 : Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.
13791 : All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.
13792 : Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.
13793 : For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.
13794 : In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.
13795 : Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.
13796 : If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.
13797 : Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company. It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.
13798 : Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.
13799 : Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.
13800 : Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.
13801 : % and % are representative of such items. They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.
13802 : (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)
13803 : They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.
13804 : Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.
13805 : Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.
13806 : Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.
13807 : Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding. But I digress...
13808 : Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.
13809 : As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch. Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.
13810 : It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.
13811 : Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong. Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.
13812 : Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.
13813 : The % is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.
13814 : Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.
13815 : The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.
13816 : I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.
13817 : I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.
13818 : Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?
13819 : Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.
13820 : Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them. Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!
13821 : And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.
13822 : I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really. Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.
13823 : As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray. Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...
13824 : Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.
13825 : Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing. There exists another: stratum abyssite.
13826 : Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite. Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.
13827 : Are you familiar with voiddust? Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.
13828 : As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch. Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.
13829 : The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust. Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me? Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.
13830 : At any rate, should you manage to obtain any voiddust in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me. Simple enough, wouldn't you say?
13831 : Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
13832 : Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.
13833 : If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.
13834 : Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land. The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
13835 : By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension.
13836 : Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.
13837 : Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.
13838 : Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.
13839 : Keep this fact in mind at all times.
13840 : It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.
13841 : If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...
13842 : Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
13843 : While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.
13844 : As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants. There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.
13845 : Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.
13846 : Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite. If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.
13847 : As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.
13848 : Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.
13849 : Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called periapt--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
13850 : Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.
13851 : Select where voidstones will be consumed from.
13852 : Set to which? Key items. Stock.
13853 : Voidstones will now be taken from [your key items/the stock].
13854 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here is your voidstone! Take it and use it well.
13855 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here are your voidstones! Take them and use them well.
13856 : It seems you already possess as many voidstones as you can carry. You'll want to hold on to that voiddust until you've depleted your supply.
13857 : How many do you need? (Cruor: #) None, thank you. One (# cruor). Three (# cruor). Six (# cruor). Nine (# cruor). Twelve (# cruor).
13858 : % obtains one % in exchange for # cruor.
13859 : % obtains # % in exchange for # cruor.

13868 : At attention, soldier! I've received an urgent alarum calling our best men to arms, and guess whose name is listed front and center? You're to report to Jeuno for further orders immediately.
13869 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me. Pick up those legs and get a move on!
13870 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me.
13871 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate in Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through.
13872 : Time is short, so pick up those legs and get a move on, soldier!
13873 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate just over there and one of our men will see you through.
13874 : Excellent work, %. You serve the Voidwatch well. Your presence has been requested in the Grand Duchy once more. Make your way there with all speed.
13875 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace.
13876 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
13877 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate at Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
13878 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
13879 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate over there and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
13880 : Where's your %, soldier? I'll need to see one before I can authorize your participation in the [Jeuno/Qufim] Voidwatch jurisdiction.
13881 : % are issued only to those brave men and women who have distinguished themselves in regional Voidwatch efforts.
13882 : Prove yourself capable in the three nations, and you can rest assured that your abilities won't go overlooked. Keep fighting the good fight, soldier!
13883 : Reporting for combat, are you? Yes, this % of yours appears to be in order. Welcome aboard!
13884 : I suspect you've already been briefed about the use of %, but protocol dictates that I ask if you are in need of a review. What will it be, soldier?
13885 : What will it be, soldier? Ready for battle, sir! I need a briefing, sir!
13886 : Now that's what I like to hear, soldier!

13904 : Hold it right there, soldier! A summons just came in from the Grand Duchy, and it's got your name on it. The envoy said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you get moving.

13929 : You may purchase up to # at a time.
13930 : You see the following words scrawled upon the lid: Free to take.
13931 : Will you take something? Nothing right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Previous Page. Next Page.
13932 : You pull out % for closer inspection.
13933 : Obtain this item? Yes. On second thought...
13934 : A super-special Starlight Celebration to you, ambitious adventurer!
13935 : What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!
13936 : Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents! These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.
13937 : And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds... I know the saying, If you give a Goblin goulash... but this is just rikupulous!
13938 : Please, %, I beseech you! Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all! (By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)
13939 : It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm. Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!
13940 : Kupopopo! Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.
13941 : And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean. Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.
13942 : And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo. Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.
13943 : And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year. Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.
13944 : Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence! ...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!
13945 : It looks like this gift is from someone named %. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo! Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!
13946 : Wonderful work, warden of weal! However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving % word that you were able to deliver the present?
13947 : The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo. Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.
13948 : Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice! Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle. We're counting on you, kupo!
13949 : The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.
13950 : Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!
13951 : I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well? Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?
13952 : Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered? We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.
13953 : What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you! We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.
13954 : Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation? The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.
13955 : (Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell [him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)
13956 : Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?
13957 : Ev'ry girl, ev'ry boy, ev'rybody, happy toy! Me nose holes smell the joy, The joy from happy toy! Wheeere cooould iiit beee?
13958 : This for me? In-doo-bid-ably! Could be gooder, but it not bad.
13959 : Waaah! It you! You give yum-yums for me tum-tum. Good [guy/girl]!
13960 : Not for us, not for me? I give it back. Now you happy? Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?
13961 : No no no no no! Go away! Nose holes busy sniff for happy toy!
13962 : ...
13963 : You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.
13964 : Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.
13965 : For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!? Me so happy head go boom! So boom! But first, me need give happy toy to you too.
13966 : Happy toy? For me? Why you give so good thing to me? But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.
13967 : Blech. What this yucky thing? It make me want upgut food. Take it away.
13968 : What? But how...? If that's truly from %, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me! If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!
13969 : Oh, I see. My apologies. How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.
13970 : Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead? I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.
13971 : Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done? I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?
13972 : I take it you delivered my present safe and sound? Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit. I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.
13973 : Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I... Wait, isn't that the gift I sent %? You didn't steal that too, did you!?
13974 : What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me? I just knew my [handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!
13975 : I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to %. Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a [knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect [his/her] mistress.
13976 : And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every [champion/handmaiden] knows that's the [chivalrous/proper] thing to do.
13977 : How fared your journey, my [courageous champion/humble handmaiden]? Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!
13978 : I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to %. How might you have come by it?
13979 : Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree? At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.
13980 : Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches % safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.
13981 : Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind. I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery? It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.
13982 : Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no? Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la.
13983 : What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise? Harken, thou hast %'s present, from whom hast thou received such consent?
13984 : 'Tis an entertaining tale with which thy jowls doth flail, A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck. Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.
13985 : While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form. Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to % once and for all!
13986 : 'Fore I finish this lengthy tirade, one last request must be made. Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.
13987 : Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile! To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!
13988 : Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to %. Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that % passy-wassed away!
13989 : ...It was just a G-g-goblin prank? Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst. By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.
13990 : As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to %?
13991 : After you pass on--the gift! Pass the gift on! Then c-c-could you report back to me? I truly-wuly want to know how % reacts.
13992 : Ah, you're back! It's %'s most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise! I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.
13993 : So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather! Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to %?
13994 : Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, [brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.
13995 : You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug! If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started! You'll be taking that gift on over to %, I tell you what!
13996 : And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done! Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!
13997 : Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating? Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!
13998 : Hey, I sent that to %. Why do you have it?
13999 : Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh? Thanks for getting it back.
14000 : Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to % again for me?
14001 : Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.
14002 : I see you've returned. Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.
14003 : What have we here? A cat burrrglar? How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!
14004 : What am I talking about? That's the prrresent I sent %! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?
14005 : Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too. Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.
14006 : But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to % and report back to me when you're done?
14007 : What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission. Whew, good thing % liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back! Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!
14008 : A present...from %? Oh, glorious day! This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.
14009 : I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion! Thank you so much!
14010 : And please thank % the next time you see that good samaritan. The person who said, 'Tis better to give than receive probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!
14011 : Oh, is that...a present? From %, you say?
14012 : Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes? That scoundrel has been stalking me ever since we happened to meet one day on a boat to Buburimu Peninsula.
14013 : I'm actually quite fed up with these ridiculous baubles, but I'm not one for losing face. If you should see % again, please give my regards and say I found the gift rather...quaint.
14014 : What's this? A present addressed to me from %?
14015 : How unexpectedly charming and thoughtful. This has certainly brightened what was about to be a gloomy Starlight Celebration.
14016 : Would you be so kind as to tell % that I truly appreciate the gift? I am also thoroughly impressed with your selfless nature, adventurer.
14017 : Could it be...? Indeed, it is benevolence manifest, emanating from the humble home of one %?
14018 : What a decidedly pleasant surprise. I am simply beside myself with an unbridled, childish glee that has not washed over me in ever so long. I swear that I am on the brink of giggling like I used to when I was still knee-high to a Taru.
14019 : The finite words of us mere mortals may not be sufficient to convey the depths of my gratitude, but I earnestly hope % would appreciate a succinct Thank you.
14020 : A present from...%? This isn't one of those tricky-wicky flimflams, is it?
14021 : Of course I'll take it! I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's from my mortaru enemy! Maybe % has turned over a new leaf since we last met...
14022 : Well then, I suppose some thanks are in order. But if I find out that this was just some elaborataru scheme to make me lower my guard, I'm going to boppy-wop you both in the noggin!
14023 : Oooh, a gift from %? What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.
14024 : I wonder what's inside... Could it be a scrum-diddly-umptious cake? But I've already gotten so roly-poly during the holiday season! Maybe I should just send it back!
14025 : No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible. Anyway, please be sure to thank % for pudding the icing on such a delectable Starcake Chocolation. Ugh, I'm just terrible!
14026 : Why would % be sending me a gift? It's not like there's anything special going on.
14027 : The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately. My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.
14028 : I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell % how happy I am to have received this. And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.
14029 : A present for me?  I'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!
14030 : What? % wanted me to have this? Well, I guess I could take it...
14031 : Don't get the wrrrong idea! It's not like I enjoy the gift or anything! Just run back to % and drop dead! This conversation never happened!
14032 : You have received %!
14033 : Your % has been taken!
14034 : You handed over %.
14035 : Voidwatch debug menu. Do nothing. Obtain 5,000,000 cruor. Obtain necessary items. Obtain level one items.
14036 : You obtain a full set of Voidwatch key items, and may now participate in any and all Voidwatch operations.
14037 : You now have 5,000,000 cruor!
14038 : Hah! Yah! Can't ye see I'm... Wait a minute. I almost didn't recognize ye...
14039 : Looks like someone's come a long way since our last meetin'. Why don't I give ye somethin' that might help in yer training?
14040 : But first, I'm gonna need proof that ye're ready. %, %, and % should do the trick.
14041 : Don't ye give me that face. It's trainin'--it ain't supposed to be easy!
14042 : Bring me %, %, and % and I'll give ye somethin' that should serve ye well.
14043 : Well, looks like someone's ready for [his/her] next challenge. As promised, here's somethin' for ya.
14044 : It's a present from our friend Chamama. As for how it's going to help yer trainin', ye've got me...
14045 : Damn it all to hell! I know I'd be able to make a bucketload of gil if I could help pioneer Adoulin...
14046 : Wait...who are ya? Whaddya doin' botherin' me?
14047 : Ya don't even know what pioneerin' is?
14048 : Hmph. Some adventurer you are! Even my grandma keeps up with the times better'n that!
14049 : ...Sorry. That was a bit harsh of me. Let me explain it to ya.
14050 : You've heard of Adoulin, right? Th' marine trading city located way to th' west, across the Sea of Zafmlug?
14051 : Well, it turns out there's undeveloped land all around there. We're talking malms and malms of jungle. Lately there's been a huge push to reclaim that land and make it worth livin' on.
14052 : Doesn't that jus' beat all? Pristine land still exists, despite all th' progress we've made. Whaddaya think it's like out there?
14053 : 'Course, not e'ryone is fit ta make headway inta th' deep unknown, so they're lookin' for the meanest and leanest adventurers ta open up the land--and fast.
14054 : Who's 'they'? Who else? The Jeuno Chamber of Commerce and Industry. C'mon, how can ya expect to become a pioneer if ya can't figure this out for yourself!?
14055 : But don' go rushin' off yet--they don' accept just anyone who can walk through th' front door and say hello. There's some kinda test ya gotta pass.
14056 : But ya got that aura of confidence about ya. Maybe yer just what they're lookin' for.
14057 : I'll be straight wit' ya. The test ain't no sit-down thing with pen and parchment. It's a bit more...hands-on.
14058 : 'Course, if it was I mighta done better. Gwahaha! Certainly not as easy as sellin' knick-knacks to higher-ups!
14059 : If ya decide to try your hand, I wish ya the best of luck!

14080 : You were unable to satisfactorily adjust the waypoint.
14081 : An enigmatic contrivance hovers in silence...
14082 : Leaning in closely to the device, one can make out miniscule etchings that read, Trade various crystals to this waypoint to receive kinetic units that may be used when you wish to warp to another locale.
14083 : Travelers may not possess more than # at a given time. Should someone trade an amount of crystals that would result in a surplus of kinetic units, those units will be lost to the aether.
14084 : You have expended # kinetic unit[/s] and will be transported to another locale.
14085 : Your stock of kinetic units is insufficient.
14086 : You have reached your limit of kinetic units and cannot charge your artifact any further.
14087 : There is no response. You apparently cannot receive kinetic units from this item.
14088 : Your artifact has been charged with # kinetic unit[/s]. Your current stock of kinetic units totals #.
14089 : Your artifact has been charged to its terminal volume of kinetic units.
14090 : A surplus of # kinetic unit[/s] has been lost to the aether.

14094 : You will be asked to confirm your choice of destination. Returning to normal teleportation mode.
14095 : Warp to your destination? Yes. No.
14096 : D-don't hurt me! I'm not a bad slime!
14097 : Could it be...? It is! Hi, %!
14098 : Do you remember me? [Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime]? Of course you do!
14099 : Thanks again for what goo did for us slimes a couple moons back.
14100 : Why are we here again? Well, you see, Horro wanted to come back for more sweets <slurp>, so...
14101 : Wait! I promise we didn't stow away for a second time! We asked him to let us come back on the Astoltia Ark, and he said yes!
14102 : But, boy, we're in a bit of a pickle once more, and I'd be grateful if you could lend me a <slurp> hand.
14103 : P-promise you won't? Oh, thank goodness <slurp>.
14104 : My name's [Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime]. I really need somegoo's help, but I don't know where to turn.
14105 : We came here on this big ship called the Astoltia Ark together with our friend, Horro.
14106 : It isn't the first time we've been here, though. Last time <slurp> we kind of...stowed away and found ourselves in this world.
14107 : We tried to behave, but ended up causing a lot of trouble for Horro and the great adventurgoos of Vana'diel.
14108 : This time, we made sure to get permission, but things didn't go like we wanted...
14109 : You see, some of our other friends--she-slimes and metal slimes--overheard our plan, and this time they stowed away instead!
14110 : So when we arrived in Vana'diel, they went bouncing off to goo-knows-where!
14111 : And if that wasn't bad enough, some of us more common slimes went off too!
14112 : If I don't bring my friends back, Horro will <slurp> leave them behind!
14113 : So you can guess what's next--I need your help.
14114 : If you give me a hand I'll... Do a little jiggle for you!
14115 : If you do really well, I'll even give you a little <slurp> something special! So, will you help?
14116 : Help find his friends? Of course! I love jiggling! No, thanks. Too much work.
14117 : Aww...[/ Maybe a little jiggle isn't enough...]
14118 : If you change your mind, I'll be right here waiting!
14119 : Why, you're the [man/woman] from before, aren't you?
14120 : Have you come to <slurp> help collect my friends?
14121 : Yay! Thank you so much!
14122 : Finding them is really easy! First, you have to go outside town and have [Slabble/Slime Tarou/Sline] cast a gootastic spell on you.
14123 : The stowaways're probably scared here in this strange land, so they might get angry or <slurp> try to run away.
14124 : Just give them a little thump on the head, and it'll turn 'em into slime coins.
14125 : I'll make sure to thank you propergoo for helping find them!
14126 : Oh, but there's one thing. The spells will make you just as weak as we are, so don't jump in without thinking!
14127 : And I forgot something else! The she-slimes and metal slimes are a bit tougher <slurp>.
14128 : The metal slimes in particular are really slippery. They could run right in front of you, and if you blinked, you'd never notice!
14129 : But they'll give you more coins--and slurpier prizes--if you happen to goo 'em!
14130 : I hope that's a good explanation. If you're ready and raring to go, I can send you to [Slabble/Slime Tarou/Slarin] right away.
14131 : Be whisked outside town? On feathered wings! I'd prefer to stay here.
14132 : Okay! Happy searching!
14133 : I'll send you whenever you want, so just let me know!
14134 : How wonderful is it to be <sneeze> back in Vana'diel. Let's see what [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] has to offer me this time!
14135 : Thank goodness I have this Ranpi-Monpi's Vana'dielian Three-Star Cuisine guide to show me just where to go!
14136 : Let me see... # slime coins? Not bad! Is there anything I can do for you?
14137 : Any requests? (# coins) I want to check available items. I want to be warped outside town. Nothing in particular.
14138 : Check which item? (Total: # coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) %. (# coin[/s]) %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) %. (# coin[/s]) [Next page/Previous page]. Back.
14139 : Hee hee! That one's a secret!
14140 : I can give you % for <slurp> # [coin/coins]. [Regooably, you don't have enough./Goo you want this item?/]
14141 : I can sell you between 1 and #. How many do you desire?
14142 : <Slurp> you don't have enough coins for that many! You can only purchase up to # total.
14143 : Ready for the exchange? (# coin[/s]) Ready, Freddy! Hang on, Helga.
14144 : <Quiver>... <Shake> <Shake>...
14145 : Why yes, % are quite a treat, indeed! Next, off to <cough> get me some %.
14146 : Or maybe I should get a couple % instead...
14147 : Ooooooh, but my guide recommends <wheeze> some ever-so-divine %!
14148 : Hohoho, with so much to choose from, how can I possibly get my hands on everything? Better get started!
14149 : Vana'diel is always abuzz, but I can't shake this feeling that <hack> there's something going on outside of town...
14150 : But dear me! If I don't hurry, the stores might close!
14151 : Or they might even run out of stock before I get there! Then there'll have been no point in coming!
14152 : Goo... Since Horro hasn't finished his shopping, we still have some time left before the ark departs.
14153 : So, please, <slurp> gather the rest of my friends before it's too late!
14154 : Oh my, how lovely! Ranpi-Monpi was right about these %!
14155 : O-oh no! Horro's done shopping!
14156 : I've got to tell him what happened so he'll stay a while longer.
14157 : Little one, [Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime] told me what happened.
14158 : I-I'm <slurp> sorry...
14159 : And if it isn't my young friend! I <sneeze> had a feeling I'd be seeing you again.
14160 : I'm sorry for all the trouble my compatriots from Astoltia caused for you yet again.
14161 : I'm sorry for all the trouble my compatriots from Astoltia caused for you.
14162 : Here's a little something as a <cough> token of my appreciation.
14163 : Yet somehow, I feel there are more slimes out there.
14164 : But don't worry. <Wheeze> I've still got business in [Bastok/Windurst/San d'Oria].
14165 : The ark will return here to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] before we leave, so I'll make sure the slimes are all gathered up by then.
14166 : Oh, Horro! You're so wonderful!
14167 : Now, listen to me. I know Vana'diel is a fun place, and you want to explore <cough> all it has to offer, but you must be more careful!
14168 : My friend, I hope our paths cross once more.
14169 : But until that fateful day, I <sniffle> bid you farewell!
14170 : And now, off to [Bastok/Windurst/San d'Oria] to try some %! Mmm, but what about a few %...?
14171 : I'm glad that Horro was so understanding <slurp>!
14172 : And thank goo for finding my friends!
14173 : I'm sure I'll be able to goother the rest of them before we leave.
14174 : But if you want to see another one of my fine performances, just <slurp> stop by again!
14175 : Oh! Oh! Horro gave me something special for you! He must be really goorateful!
14176 : Hey, there! Peer deep within the Quests menu to find the Objective List under Records of Eminence and slap the objective there into place!
14177 : Attention! My name's Isakoth, and for today's lesson we're going to learn about...
14178 : Anything to say? Impart to me your knowledge! I don't have to listen to you. Nothing. Just walk away.
14179 : Who gave you permission to leave!? A proper disciple listens to [his/her] master's advice at all times!
14180 : No one absolutely has to do anything, but I promise I have important and fun stuff to say. Everyone wants to have fun, right?
14181 : You're not going to get anywhere in life with that attitude. You need to learn how to cooperate, to go with the flow!
14182 : That's the spirit! You're an adventurer in my spitting image...at least when it comes to passion.
14183 : Today's lesson is all about Records of Eminence, so break out your textbook and turn to page five!
14184 : What's that? Tsk, tsk, tsk. If you've forgotten your textbook, you'll have to share with the person next to you.
14185 : Let's get this show on the road. Records of Eminence is, in a word...
14186 : ...fighting spirit!
14187 : So what if that's two words!? That illustrates my point all the more. Adventurers need to give it eighty-thousand percent at all times if they want to uphold justice!
14188 : Class dismissed! Now go out there and do me proud.
14189 : Anything to say? Yessir! That's it?
14190 : You can't fool me by just assenting to everything I say. That's not how education works. You'll never walk the path to enlightenment behaving like that!
14191 : That curiosity of yours will really take you places, [lad/lass]. It's positively indispensable for any child of the Goddess.
14192 : To tell the truth, though, you're already well on your way to prominence!
14193 : You even completed your first objective simply by talking to me. Furthermore, my experience tells me you'll be rewarded with some unusual type of compensation.
14194 : Now, take the next step on your journey and try setting an objective all by yourself!
14195 : No need to break out in a sweat--your eminent teacher will guide you. Just choose an objective under the Objective List in the Records of Eminence section of the Quests menu.
14196 : I hear you can even repeat certain ones. I'll let you figure out which ones they are on your own, though. I wouldn't want you to just regurgitate the answers I give you, now, would I?
14197 : Like I hinted at before, you gain sparks of eminence that quantify your achievements. Trade them to me and I'll give you back some tokens of gratitude.
14198 : Whoa, now. I teach more advanced subjects than you're able to understand at the moment. Try talking to Gulldago to learn the basics first.
14199 : By the way, this little bugger here, which we call %, records all your eminent feats for you.
14200 : Hm? Oh. Yes, I too sometimes become unsettled by its constant and intense glaring.
14201 : Luckily, all you need to do is to clap your hands together like so and...
14202 : ...it vanishes into thin air. See, even this soulless machination possesses a fighting spirit. How else could it disappear instantaneously like that?
14203 : Just kidding. I'm only trying to cover up the fact that I don't know how it works. As my mentor always said, When you don't know the answer to a question, distract the person with a joke.
14204 : Well, I've officially taught you all I know. Go out into the world with your trusty % and prove how esteemed you truly are!
14205 : ...I always get a little teary-eyed when I see my disciples go off to bigger and better things...<sniffle>
14206 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
14207 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
14208 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
14209 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
14210 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).
14211 : Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.
14212 : The % nods in agreement.
14213 : new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
14214 : new Records of Eminence objective, %, is now available!
14215 : You wish to exchange your sparks?
14216 : Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
14217 : Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
14218 : Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
14219 : Thanks to your donation, I now have # % in safekeeping.
14220 : Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
14221 : Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
14222 : Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
14223 : Why? What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
14224 : Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of # % from you.
14225 : You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
14226 : Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
14227 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
14228 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
14229 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
14230 : Grrreat! Now I have # % from you. Thanks!
14231 : Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
14232 : I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
14233 : Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
14234 : I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
14235 : Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of # % for you.
14236 : Records of Eminence is a system brought to you by the caring folks at the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Set your own objectives whenever you desire, and fulfill them to receive compensation.
14237 : To set these tasks, select 'Objective List' from the Quests menu, then choose ones that suit your fancy.
14238 : You will be rewarded with gil and sparks of eminence, which serve the same function as points, notes, credits, and other such methods of quantifying one's greatness. As an extra incentive, adventurers will earn three times the amount of sparks for completing an objective the first time.
14239 : Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
14240 : As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
14241 : Lastly, any and all acts of vandalism directed against your % are strictly prohibited.
14242 : Should you be found in violation of this dictum, the heavens will part and wrath incarnate will descend to mete out justice upon you.
14243 : The maximum number of % that may be stored is #.
14244 : You do not possess enough % to complete the transaction.
14245 : You do not possess enough sparks of eminence to complete the transaction.

14266 : Once you accumulate # of these marks, they will be automatically converted to one % and added to the total number held.
14267 : Though I am only authorized to accept a limited selection of equipment at present, the A.M.A.N. is considering making further additions to this list, so please check back regularly.

14321 : Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha? Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!
14322 : While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it. Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum. Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.
14323 : Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm!  Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'. Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?
14324 : Oh yeah, 'fore I forget. What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.
14325 : Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...
14326 : Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes. Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more. "Good things come tah dose who wait," right? Well, da longer ya wait, da gooder da thing...maybe. Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.
14327 : Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer daily tally. It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.
14328 : Finally, ya opens da chest. Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!
14329 : Oh, dat's right! Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase! Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?
14330 : And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy! But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.
14331 : Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it. Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.
14332 : Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble. It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.
14333 : Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in. Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.
14334 : Dat all make 'nough sense tah ya? Just say da woid when ya wanna use my services. I's more'n happy tah help.
14335 : Hey! I rem'mber seein' yer foice 'round here. Take a looksie. I's taken' it upon myself tah jigger 'round wit' dese all-new myst'ry boxes, found straight from an ol' capsized vessel in the Gugru Blue.
14336 : I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!
14337 : Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?
14338 : Dese're some special dials, an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!
14339 : Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese special dials? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.
14340 : So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.
14341 : 'N openin' 'em requires some kinda secret technique. Maybe it'll succeed, maybe tha box'll break. 'Sif I know. But ya can only try 'em once a day.
14342 : Oho, ya feelin' lucky 'nough tah takes a stab at da myst'ry box?
14343 : Whatcha gonna do? (# tally) Open the box and profit! Listen to the explanation. Inquire about my daily tally.  Peek at some possibilities. Nothing right now.
14344 : Ya wanna open dat sucker up? Okay, but which dial ya be wantin'?
14345 : Dat's da spirit! So which dial ya be wantin'?
14346 : So, what dial ya gonna pick? (# tally) I got cold feet, so none. Dial 1 (Materials): # tally. Dial 2 (Food): # tally. Dial 3 (Medicine): # tally. Dial 4 (Sundries 1): # tally. Dial 5 (Sundries 2): # tally. Special dial: # tally [/ (already opened)]. Adoulin dial: # tally[/ (already opened)]. Pictlogica dial: # tally[/ (already opened)].    Wanted dial: # tally[/ (already opened)].
14347 : Yer goin' wit' dial #, huh?  Whatchu tryin' ta pull!? Yer daily tally's too low.
14348 : Yer goin' wit' dial #, huh? Lessee what myst'ries await!
14349 : Dis box is full o' myst'ries, Dat span da realm's his'try, So whatcha gonna get from da chest...o'...uh, fortunery?
14350 : Oooh, looks at what popped out! I hopes it makes yer adventures dat much more adventumarous!
14351 : Ya's thought I threw yer prize away?! Prepostamarous! I's just tucked it away for safekeepin' is all.
14352 : You have used # [point/points] of your daily tally!
14353 : Wanna go again?
14354 : Keep goin'? Lemme at it! Thanks, but no thanks.
14355 : Yer daily tally? It's, um... Y'know, 'round # [point/points] or thereamabouts.
14356 : Lemme check for ya! Well, it coulda been %, %, or mebbe even %. What? Ya thinks ya could do better wit' one o' dese Gobbie masks on!?
14357 : Anywise, where'd da myst'ry be if ya's knew da answer 'fore ya opens it?
14358 : Some things is better left unknown. Gotta leave a little room fer romanchismo in da woild, y'know.
14359 : Dere we goes. Da myst'ry box seems tah like yer offerin'...but it wants more. Got anythin' else ya wanna throw away?
14360 : Dere we goes. Oho, looks like it don't wants no more. Guess ya gotta come back tomorrow if ya's wanna keep gettin' rid o' stuff.
14361 : Yer daily tally's increased [a smidge./someamawhats./a Gobby-fold!/a ginormagantic amount!]
14362 : Sorrah, but it won't lemme put dis in. Got anythin' it mights like better?
14363 : Sorrah, but da chest has dat look. Y'know, da one dat says, "I'll kills ya if ya tries tah give me dat." I guess alls ya can do is comes back some odda time.
14364 : Nah, it just won't woik. I's did my best, but yer daily tally just won't go no higher. Ya ain't gonna get no prizes by hoardin' yer points, so stop bein' such a Greedalox and use 'em.
14365 : Gil-lovin' Gobbies, %, ya's hit da jackpot! I's so happy for ya I think I's gettin' da vapors.
14366 : % obtains %!
14367 : Whoawhoawhoa! If ya's got business wit' da box, ya foist gots business wit' me. Whatcha need?
14368 : So ya be wantin' the special dial? Whoawhoawhoa! Get yer grubby hands offa that! Ya don't have enough daily tally, and I's not 'bout tah let ya cheat me!
14369 : So ya be wantin' the [special/Adoulin/pictlogica/Wanted/campaign] dial? M'kay, get yerself all steeled up, 'cause here we go! 'Member, no complaints!

14372 : Dun think that I's be a gil-grubbin' good-fer-nuthin'. If'n ya dun wanna open any dial, then I gives ya back yer %.
14373 : Yer eyes be bigger'n yer stomach. If'n ya wanna open [/Dial 1/Dial 2/Dial 3/Dial 4/Dial 5/the Special Dial///the abjuration dial/the fortune dial/the furnishings dial//the Vana'versary dial] usin' yer %, then ya gotta make room in yer bags!
14374 : What's be dis? %? What'm I 'pposed ta do wit it? I dun have any clue how ta use it, so take it home wit ya.
14375 : #<#
14376 : I understand that you are...an adventurer? My name is Pieuje I. d'Oraguille, commander of San d'Oria's famed Temple Knights.
14377 : Is that %'s voice I hear?
14378 : Forgive me, but I am more accustomed to recognizing faces than voices, especially through such a peculiar device.
14379 : I must thank you for your handling of the Altedour incident in Fei'Yin.
14380 : Never once have I forgotten your dedication to protecting all of San d'Oria.
14381 : As you are doubtlessly aware, a short time ago I received a memorandum from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network detailing Unity Concord and requesting my services as a Unity leader.
14382 : Tell me. Is there any greater way for a prince regent to earn honor for his kingdom than by spearheading a group dedicated to purging evil from the land?
14383 : Many around me were opposed, but that bothered me not. My brother, Trion, serves as a representative of the Trust initiative, and it falls to me to up the ante.
14384 : I cannot lie. That was an important factor in my decision.
14385 : But be not concerned with our internal squabbles. Know only that it pleases me to welcome you to my Unity.
14386 : My name is Ayame, a ranking member of the Mythril Musketeers. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
14387 : Haha...yes, %, of course I remember you. How characteristic of you to have your fingers in everyone's pies.
14388 : Do not think me ungrateful. No, I am always pleased to have your help, but this time things are a bit different.
14389 : Do not think me ungrateful. You strengthened the Mythril Musketeers in ways I never thought possible, and we are closer than ever before.
14390 : Not terribly long ago I was contacted by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, which asked that I head a Unity.
14391 : At first I was flustered and thought of turning the offer down. Why would they pick me when there are others more qualified?
14392 : But Volker decided it would be the perfect opportunity for me to develop my leadership skills, and told them I would accept...without my knowledge.
14393 : Though unconvinced that I am the best fit, I pledge to dedicate myself wholly to this endeavor.
14394 : People are counting on me. Not only Volker, but those like you who have pledged their support.
14395 : I will not let you down.
14396 : Stand sharp, maggot! I've got no time for people who're gonna slack off!
14397 : ...Wait. That's you, isn't it, %?
14398 : I hear you've decided to join my backbreaking Unity.
14399 : Well!? What've you got to say for yourself!?
14400 : How do you respond? That's right. Nope. Y-yessir!
14401 : Impudent cretin! You say sir when addressing a superior officer!
14402 : Better. Everyone in my Unity is equal--you're all worthless whelps!
14403 : We don't coddle the weak around here. If you want respect, you earn it.
14404 : Until then, you're just a dried-up, shriveled worm!
14405 : So go crawling around in the dirt and pray some crow doesn't sweep down and gobble you up!
14406 : Now get out there!
14407 : Hello, good adventurer. You can call me Apururu.
14408 : Is that...%? Am I rightaru?
14409 : Your good deeds on behalf of Windurstaru have not gone unnoticed.
14410 : I'm so worried about my brother...but if this is one way for me to help-welp him, then so be it.
14411 : Ajido-Marujido has awoken at lastaru, but...no, I'll not let myself cry. I must work for the good of Windurst.
14412 : You brought hope to a Windurst that was on the brink-wink of despair.
14413 : I've been selected to serve as the head of a Unity-wunity, and can I ever say...
14414 : As the head of the Manustery, there can be no greater honor than--
14415 : Aaaaaall right! Now the Cardian workshop can finally turn something resembling a profitaru!
14416 : tHiS iS aBsoLUtElY WonDErFul. NoW wE HaVe MOneY, ALl ThaNkS tO APurURu!
14417 : H-hey! It's not like I'll be making bank-wank!
14418 : Putting that aside--welcome to my Unitaru!
14419 : We can do together-wether what we couldn't individually.
14420 : Phew... So you're my new pupil, eh?
14421 : Phew... So you're my new pu... %?
14422 : The way you shone when the two of us met in combat...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't impressed.
14423 : I've gotta say, you sure knew how to show me the old what-for...it was like staring into the face of a demon!
14424 : I've lived many years on this green Vana'diel, but you're the only one I've ever proffered my hat to.
14425 : ...Let's discuss how all this came to be.
14426 : The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network came up with this Unity idea, and asked me to be one of its founding masters.
14427 : But I'm not the kind to take on disciples, so at first I was more than a bit wary.
14428 : But the old lady, she nagged me, and nagged me, and nagged me until I finally caved in.
14429 : How do you respond? You can always quit, you know. Must have been tough for you. That's quite the wife you've got.
14430 : Ugh... I didn't expect you to come at me with that.
14431 : Tough doesn't begin to describe it! I was hoping to spend my twilight years for myself, but you gotta play the hand you're dealt.
14432 : Please tell me that you weren't in on it!
14433 : Either way, that's not important now. As long as I'm the master of a ragtag group of youngsters, I'm gonna make sure you all get the training you deserve.
14434 : But to do that, I'm gonna need your help.
14435 : And I'll warn you--my regimens have been known to be...strict.
14436 : And I'm sure I don't need to tell you how strict my regimens are!
14437 : What's the password?
14438 : How do you respond? Rose on the heath. Tavnazia.
14439 : Who's this!? ...Ah, this is the Unity communication device. Forget I said anything.
14440 : Aldo of the Tenshodo, at your service.
14441 : Who's this!? ...Ah, this is the Unity communication...wait. You're %, aren't you?
14442 : The way this little thing is buzzing tells me that you're looking to join my Unity.
14443 : My Unity being the key here. Who else did you expect to be the leader?
14444 : I'm sure the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network would make for...excellent customers in the future.
14445 : Serve the Unity well and I promise you'll want for nothing.
14446 : You found hope where once I had lost it. Lion was alive and I'll never forget all you've done.
14447 : All that she had worked and fought for...we owe it to her to live our lives to the fullest.
14448 : Working with others for a common goal is the greatest reward of all.
14449 : And it's people like you who I need to understand that most.
14450 : Well, do we have a new rrrecruit? I'm Jakoh Wahcondalo, chieftainess of Kazham.
14451 : Come to think of it...didn't I teach you the secrets of eviscerrration?
14452 : Hah-hah-hah! Then all the better for my Unity!
14453 : Are you sure...are you sure you're not currrsed by %?
14454 : Can never be too carrreful these days...
14455 : Let's cut to the quick. You've joined my Unity, corrrect?
14456 : Then welcome.
14457 : But a quick word of warrrning.
14458 : I'm in charrrge here, so don't go about being disruptive!
14459 : If you can do that, we'll have no prrroblems. Now get to it!
14460 : H-hello, you've reached Salaheem's Sentinels.
14461 : There's no problem we can't solve, big or small!
14462 : Aha, we have a new visitor? One moment--I'll get the president for you.
14463 : Yes, this is Naja Salaheem.
14464 : Ah, have we an adventurerrr applying today?
14465 : You could not have picked a betterrr place to be.
14466 : Our Unity is completely free of charge, making it the purrrfect place to hang up your sword and meet some new companions.
14467 : We considerrr it our calling to provide an excellent place for those of all strrripes to utilize their talents in a variety of combat scenes.
14468 : Abquhbah! Get your lazy butt over here!
14469 : S-sorry. Yes, [good sir/my lady], this is Abquhbah of Salaheem's Sentinels.
14470 : We have a variety of powerful backers supporting our organization...
14471 : ...So I'm certain you'll find achieving a high Unity ranking to be a breeze.
14472 : And if we do, then there will be a lovely gift of sweets waiting. Yes, some gold pieces of--
14473 : <Sigh>... Oh, heavens, I think this device isn't worrrking properly. Can you hear me now?
14474 : How do you respond? Loud and clear. Where's Abquhbah? Just what did you do?
14475 : Please forrrgive his impudence.
14476 : We're looking forward to having you serrrve in our regiment.
14477 : And we hope you enjoy your looong stay in our rrranks!
14478 : Oho? Is that % I hear?
14479 : %? Gimme that!
14480 : Picturrre that, hearing from [a non-employee/a second class private/a first class private/a superior private/a lance corporal/a corporal/a sergeant/a sergeant major/a chief sergeant/a second lieutenant/a first lieutenant/a captain] such as yourself.
14481 : You've got some gall shirrrking your duties like this!
14482 : But since you've joined my Unity, I'm willing to overlook that little trrransgression.
14483 : Let's paint the rankings rrred with our unstoppable team!
14484 : And that rrrequires you to not sit around like some good-for-nothing! You belong not just to one of my teams, but to two!
14485 : Be thankful you have work and get your butt out there!
14486 : The magic doll you are trying to reach is either suffering from mystical interference or is not attuned to a bearer.
14487 : Please check the settings and try a-again... Mmph...
14488 : Ahaha! Who can ever resist a good joke? It's me, and no other!
14489 : How do you react? Flaviria? Arciela? Who?
14490 : Oho, expertly deduced! I'd expect no less!
14491 : Huh? Arciela? That little waif of a princess? Granted, I'm quite pretty as well...
14492 : Urk...I'd have expected you to go with the joke...
14493 : But let's get down to business.
14494 : I'm Flaviria, maester of Adoulin's Mummers' Coalition.
14495 : I'm Flaviria, of course. I'm sure you've been to the Mummers' Coalition more than once, so my name should be quite familiar.
14496 : The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network invited me to be a Unity leader...and how could I say no?
14497 : Though truth be told, I wonder why they picked me over one of the other leaders of the twelve orders.
14498 : Now that I think of it, didn't you trounce one of our more enigmatic patrons in a game of Boom or Bust?
14499 : And here I thought that the man in black couldn't be bested.
14500 : I'd better brush up, or you'll be coming for me next!
14501 : Either way, welcome to my Unity! I'm not completely clear on how best to proceed, but let's find the path together.
14502 : Ahem. <Cough-ethy>
14503 : So you're the young mind who's come to join-ethy my Unity?
14504 : Well met, I am Dr. Yoran-Oran, former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery in Windurst, and involved in all manner of magical research.
14505 : Ah, didn't you assist-ethy me with my mandragora research back then? Those items were of great help, thank you.
14506 : Ah, I know that voice-ethy! %, that's you, isn't it?
14507 : Your efforts-ethy saved the Great Star Tree. Windurst owes you a deep debt of gratitude.
14508 : Listen %. Those three monstrosities you so kindly brought into my life have put me in a very disconcerting situation-ethy. I have a lot more to say about it, but for now let's focus-ethy on the issue at hand.
14509 : Things have slowly gone back to normal-ethy now that the wretched trio of chaos incarnate has left. I've finally managed to begin work-ethy on my next book.
14510 : Thank you again for your aid during the Shantotto crisis-ethy. Were it not for you, our entire dimension would have been twisted and defiled beyond recognition. I still get nightmares-ethy thinking about it.
14511 : You see, I have many students who regularly come-ethy to me to learn from my vast well of knowledge, but the students who buy my books are by far the best-ethy.
14512 : One of these students was part of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network-ethy and invited me to become a Unity leader.
14513 : I hesitated, of course. Wasting my intellectual prowess in the adventuring business-ethy didn't seem fitting for a scholar like myself.
14514 : But then I thought-ethy some more.
14515 : Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?
14516 : With this flawless object in mind, I've decided-ethy to accept the nomination as Unity leader.
14517 : And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.
14518 : You see, I have many students who regularly come-ethy to me to learn from my vast well of knowledge, but the students who buy my books are by far the best-ethy.
14519 : One of these students was part of the Adventurers Mutual Aid Network-ethy and invited me to become a Unity leader.
14520 : I hesitated, of course. Wasting my intellectual prowess in the adventuring business-ethy didn't seem fitting for a scholar like myself.
14521 : But then I thought-ethy some more.
14522 : Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?
14523 : With this flawless object in mind, I've decided-ethy to accept the nomination as Unity leader.
14524 : And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.
14525 : .........
14526 : Oh! Right! I should probably say something. I'm Sylvie. As you can probably guess from these clothes. I'm a geomanger--I mean, geomancer!
14527 : Oh, I forgot...you can't see my clothes, right? Forget I said that, okay?
14528 : Oh, huh? %? Is that %?
14529 : Oh, %, it's you.
14530 : %! It's %!
14531 : How are you getting along with your luopan? Have you gotten used to using Colures, yet? If you keep your head and shoulders to the grindstone I'm sure you'll master it!
14532 : I know Daddy's training can be rough, but it looks like you passed his test with flying pigs...is that how you say that?
14533 : Did you know that Daddy would speak really highly of you? He would always talk about how a promising new geomancer showed up and was looking forward to seeing what you could do... He seemed so happy.
14534 : I can still feel your Communion. If it weren't for you back there, we would have been domed, I mean doomed. Anyway, thank you %.
14535 : It's all thanks to you that we were able to fulfill Zacariah's duty. You're like the most...stupenderrific hero to all us Zacariahs!
14536 : So...I guess this mean you'll be joining my Unity?
14537 : Thank you so much. It means a lot to me.  As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.
14538 : Ikhi said this wasn't a good time for me to be leading a Unity.
14539 : But...I couldn't just stay at home doing nothing. It's easier to forget the sad things when you've got a lot to do, you know?
14540 : So when the offer for Unity leader came, I had to accept.
14541 : You can't stay blue forever. Daddy would probably laugh at me if he saw how down and depressivated I am these days.
14542 : ...Right, smile Sylvie! Let's make this Unity work. With you as part of the team, I'm sure our efforts will bring us bear fruit. Huh...why do they call it bear fruit?
14543 : Wait, so does this mean you'll be joining my Unity?
14544 : As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.
14545 : With you on our team, we'll be truly unstoppableable!
14546 : To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure what to do when the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network first invited me.
14547 : If it weren't for Ikhi's guidance, I'd be down a creek full of paddles.
14548 : She said if the Unity could show people everywhere how to communicate with nature and spread the ways of the geomancer, then it was something worth doing.
14549 : There's still a lot I don't know as a geomancer, but I'm going to triple down and do my best as UL.
14550 : Let's make this the best Unity we can!
14551 : Yeah, go team!
14552 : And...if you happened to be in Western Adoulin...and are also interested in geomancy, come see me by the docks. Wait, but not like...in a weird way, okay?
14553 : It might be in your best interests to speak to [Urbiolaine/Igsli/Teldro-Kesdrodo/Nunaarl Bthtrogg] in % [(G-10)/(E-11)/(J-10)/(H-11)].
14554 : Join which Unity? I need time to consider. Pieuje. Ayame. Invincible Shield. Apururu. Maat. Aldo. Jakoh Wahcondalo. Naja Salaheem. Flaviria. Yoran-Oran. Sylvie.

14576 : Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
14577 : Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.
14578 : Unity is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.
14579 : Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.
14580 : Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as %.
14581 : Chat settings may be changed by selecting Status from the main menu, and choosing Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
14582 : You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.
14583 : Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.
14584 : The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.
14585 : Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).
14586 : Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.
14587 : Wanted objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.
14588 : These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as Unity accolades to undertake.
14589 : Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.
14590 : Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.
14591 : The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.
14592 : A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.
14593 : Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.
14594 : Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.
14595 : When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.
14596 : Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.
14597 : No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.
14598 : You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.
14599 : An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.
14600 : One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.
14601 : A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.
14602 : You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.
14603 : Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.
14604 : Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.
14605 : Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.
14606 : The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.
14607 : It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.
14608 : The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.
14609 : Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.
14610 : These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.
14611 : Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.
14612 : Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of # accolades per week (Earth time).
14613 : You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.
14614 : This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.
14615 : This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.
14616 : However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.
14617 : Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.
14618 : The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.
14619 : Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.
14620 : Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.
14621 : On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.
14622 : Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by #. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.
14623 : The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.
14624 : Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.
14625 : Those with evaluations of # or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.
14626 : Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.
14627 : A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.
14628 : Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.
14629 : A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.
14630 : It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.
14631 : Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.
14632 : ou are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.
14633 : he A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.
14634 : ou call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.
14635 : ou have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.
14636 : hould you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?
14637 : Teleport anyway? Yes, please. No, thank you.
14638 : Ah, a sprightly adventurer has come to me this day! Yes, I am more than pleased to make your acquaintance.
14639 : Forgive me for seeming elitist, but the message I have to bear is only for those who have completed at least # Records of Eminence objective[/s].
14640 : Isakoth, standing just over there, is well versed in such matters and would be happy to provide you any guidance you need.
14641 : Ah, yes, I have some wonderful information for you, but you must first set the Records of Eminence objective % from the Tutorial section of the eponymous submenu.
14642 : Oh, my stomach! That vengeful witch must have put something in my...
14643 : G-goodness! A new recruit! Please, a thousand pardons.
14644 : Do you perhaps have the Records of Eminence objective % set?
14645 : How do you respond? Locked and loaded. You got the wrong [guy/gal].
14646 : Is that so? Perhaps I made a-- My head! Oh, Goddess, the pain!
14647 : Huzzah! A willing soul has graced my presence at last.
14648 : You are willing, aren't you? To participate in Unity Concord, that is?
14649 : How do you respond? Participate I shall. I need time to think.
14650 : H-how absolutely frustrating! To have come this far only to-- Aaaaaah! I think I threw my back out!
14651 : Y-you mean it? Oh, praise the powers above! I feared yet another was bound to disappoint me.
14652 : To get started, I'll need you to place your signature in black right here on this doll.
14653 : Your quill flourishes across the doll's stomach.
14654 : The doll begins to convulse!
14655 : Excellent. With that concluded, permit me to offer a brief explanation of what Unity Concord entails.
14656 : The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.) has founded this unique system to provide casual means of communication between adventurers of similar minds.
14657 : Foster new friendships and strengthen old ones! Further your adventuring goals by coming together as one! Quite lofty goals, indeed.
14658 : The first step is choosing which leader's Unity you would like to join.
14659 : After all that discussion you-- Oh, my heart! It's like a vise clamping on my chest!
14660 : I'll be waiting here with your doll when you are r-ready to decide!
14661 : Ah, good day! I have your doll safe right here should you be inspired to join a Unity.
14662 : Which you are, correct?
14663 : Wonderful! You desire to join [Pieuje's/Ayame's/Invincible Shield's/Apururu's/Maat's/Aldo's/Jakoh Wahcondalo's/Naja Salaheem's/Flaviria's/Yoran-Oran's/Sylvie's] Unity, correct?
14664 : Now grip your doll tightly and think pleasant thoughts of your Unity leader...
14665 : <Phew> That's one task down.
14666 : But your % can be used for contacting more than just your leader.
14667 : Since your Unity is comprised of others with the same type of doll, it naturally follows that you can converse with them as well.
14668 : I would therefore suggest that you take the opportunity to introduce yourself.
14669 : Such interactions can be established by going to the Status menu and selecting Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
14670 : Come to me again should you desire any further information about the inner workings of Unity Concord.
14671 : A fair day to you, [sir/ma'am]! How may I help you?
14672 : Understood. And away to % you go!
14673 : Oh dear! You don't have enough accolades to do that.
14674 : Hmmm...you can still exchange # more accolade[/s] this week.
14675 : I'm sure that would look perfect on you. Here's a quick glance at what you'd be getting.
14676 : The Unity Concord artisan will provide you with % in exchange for %, # ), and # Unity accolade[/s].
14677 : I must inform you that such a process is not instantaneous. Return at a later date and I will provide you with your finished piece.
14678 : You have currently contracted us to make % for you. Our artisan can only handle one item per customer at a time.
14679 : This is what your equipment will look like with its new attribute.
14680 : Boosting its rank even further will make an upgrade like this possible. I think you will be pleased with the results.
14681 : In order to add a new attribute, you will need some % in addition to your %, as well as # accolade[/s].
14682 : You must also complete the Records of Eminence objective % beforehand.
14683 : If you bring some % in addition to the % with the new attribute, you can increase its rank.
14684 : I am in charge of handling both tasks.
14685 : Although I have been trained, I find my lack of actual experience tends to increase my apprehension somewhat.
14686 : %? That costs # accolade[/s].
14687 : How many do you require? (from 1 to #)
14688 : Splendid. # ) will run you # accolade[/s].
14689 : Always a pleasure to serve.
14690 : Ah, sometimes a change of pace is for the best. Whose Unity did you have in mind?
14691 : I have filled out the necessary documents. Welcome to your new Unity!
14692 : Understood. Let me know should you have a change of heart.
14693 : Oh, thank the heavens! This 20-ponz manual has thrown all my muscles into utter disarray!
14694 : I suppose a quick explanation is in order.
14695 : Accomplishing Records of Eminence objectives rewards you with a special currency known as Unity accolades.
14696 : As is standard fare for currency, it can be exchanged for a variety of goods and services.
14697 : Naturally, there are more nuanced aspects, but that's the basic workings of the system.
14698 : Aha. You wish to have your % improved?
14699 : Our talented arcane specialist requires a fee of # accolade[/s] for that service. Is that acceptable to you?
14700 : Your patronage is duly appreciated, and your order should be filled in due time.
14701 : I-I see. Then let me return your piece to you.
14702 : Our artisan is currently tied up with your %. I ask that you please wait until the process is complete.
14703 : Your % may have taken some time to complete, but I guarantee you the quality will not disappoint! Here.
14704 : C-could you be here to request an upgrade for your %!?
14705 : If so, do you mind paying a nominal fee of # accolade[/s]?
14706 : S-so, what do you think? I hope it is to your liking...
14707 : I-I see. Then let me return your piece to you.
14708 : Ah, you will need to complete the Records of Eminence objective % before you can make the request.
14709 : Understood. You wish to use # ) to store Reinforcement Points for your %?
14710 : Sorry to keep you waiting, but I think you'll be pleased with the results. Go ahead, see for yourself.
14711 : I-I see. Then let me return your piece to you.
14713 : The crystal resonates deep within your soul!
14714 : Vana'diel...in the year 898?
14715 : I must make haste for Reisenjima and find the master before...
14716 : Master, look at the orb.
14717 : You have set us on the proper course and passed through the first of many gates to come.
14718 : This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.
14719 : Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.
14720 : Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.
14721 : In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.
14722 : Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.
14723 : Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.
14724 : Master, behold your orb.
14725 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.
14726 : But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...
14727 : And I am unable to remain here in 884.
14728 : My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.
14729 : Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...
14730 : But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.
14731 : May your steps remain swift and true.
14732 : Head for...the palace...
14733 : Master, behold your orb.
14734 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.
14735 : But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.
14736 : I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.
14737 : If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!
14738 : Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!
14739 : Master...forgive me.
14740 : Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.
14741 : I'm so hungry...
14742 : Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?
14743 : I'm here...[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...
14744 : Luzaf...I wish you were here...
14745 : Please...help me...
14746 : Razfahd must be stopped...
14747 : The time of the Harvest Festival is upon us once more, and with it comes a most wondrous event: a costume contest known as the Pink Masquerade!
14748 : Sick of donning those tattered old robes and half-rusted suits of armor? Then why not take this opportunity to dress up in something more festive--and perhaps even earn a prize for your efforts?
14749 : At the very least, the masquerade promises to be a refreshing change from your everyday adventures. What say you?
14750 : Participate in the Pink Masquerade? Sounds like fun! I think I'll pass.
14751 : A shame upon shames, to be sure. But there's still time to change your mind--the masquerade is available throughout the duration of the Harvest Festival!
14752 : Splendid! Let me explain the rules of our little competition.
14753 : All entrants are tasked with putting together the most lavish outfits they can find and strutting their stuff for the judge--namely, me. Points are awarded for the following types of equipment: main weapon, sub weapon, head, body, hands, legs, and feet.
14754 : We're an equal opportunity contest, so don't think you'll be impressing anyone here with your Gjallarhorns or Idrises! Only rewards gleaned from special events are counted.
14755 : Feel free to brandish them if you want, but don't expect me to care in the slightest.
14756 : As this is an event to celebrate the Harvest Festival, entrance fees will not be charged in the form of gil, but rather sweets.
14757 : Those whose outfits receive at least # points will be awarded with a commemorative piece of attire directly from the steering committee.
14758 : But why be content with being mediocre when you can reach for the stars? The top three contestants will have their entries displayed on these mannequins for all to see!
14759 : That's the long and short of it. Speak with me again if you have any further questions or would like to know what types of sweets we accept.
14760 : Until then, prepare your most outlandish costume and come back when you're ready to be judged!
14761 : Take this special garb as your just rewarded for coming up with such a delightful outfit!
14762 : Oh, heavens! Don't tell me you lost your %!
14763 : A distressing tale, indeed. I will furnish you with another one should you provide me with another piece of sweets.
14764 : As promised, here is another reward in exchange for your sweets. Make sure to keep this one safe and in pristine condition!
14765 : The pink masquerade is proving to be the event of the season, and I am both humbled and honored to serve as your guide.
14766 : Do you have any questions? Who are the winning entrants? Tell me about the costume contest. What kind of sweets do you want? Tell me how entrants are judged. I'd like %. None for now.
14767 : The costumes of the three entrants with the highest scores are displayed here for you to see. First place is in the center, second place is on the left, and third place is on the right. It is possible that multiple entrants have received the same score.
14768 : [/First/Second/Third] place: % - # pts.
14769 : No participants have received enough points to have their outfits displayed.
14770 : I will accept any of the following types of sweets as payment for participation in the masquerade.
14771 : Sweets list: (# types. Page # of #) Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm done. Next page.
14772 : The judgment criteria is a bit nuanced, but I'll offer you the best explanation I can.
14773 : As the sole arbiter of fashion, the chief and chief alone issues garment-related edicts without any concern for race or gender.
14774 : Each accent you add to your costume affects the overall look, and he will determine a numerical value based upon the stuff you strut.
14775 : Yet I must warn you that he has trained hard under Brygid's watchful eye, and recognizes that the trends of the season are as fickle as the westerly winds.
14776 : In other words, just because you have received a particular score for wearing a given outfit, you are not guaranteed the same reception if you come back later donning the same garb.
14777 : And of course, the sweets you give me plays an integral... Ahem! Forget I said anything!
14778 : Another player's outfit is currently being critiqued. Please come back later.
14779 : Well, well, would you look at that stunning little number. Chief! You have a visitor!
14780 : Your score for this outfit is... #!
14781 : [Did your mother dress you in that?/Next time, put your socks on under your shoes!/I've seen worse...but not by much./Maybe if you had offered up some better sweets.../<Yawn> Been there, done that./The chief is wholly unimpressed./What an affront to common sensibility./At least you remembered to brush your teeth./The color scheme was a bit off...] Take your mistakes and learn from them for your next entry!
14782 : Congratulations! You have met the bar for success!
14783 : Here is your splendid gift, as promised!
14784 : I have given you all I have to give, but why not give it another go to see if you can place in the top three?
14785 : Why, this is one of the most splendid outfits we've seen! I am more than pleased to award you [/first/second/third] place!
14786 : Let me put that wonderful costume of yours up for display on one of our mannequins.
14787 : That's all I have for now. See if you can beat your own personal record next time!
14788 : As promised, here is your just reward for doing such a good job in this year's Pink Masquerade.
14789 : Though I've got nothing more to give you, I encourage you to participate again to see if you can beat your score!
14790 : (Shhh...mannequins aren't supposed to talk.)
14791 : (The pain of having to stand here perfectly still is indescribable...)
14792 : (At least I'll be able to line my stomach with sugary goodness once this is over.)
14793 : You must first turn the style lock function off before trading that item.
14794 : #%(Max:#)
14795 : #Woo-hoo factor.
14796 : (#/#/#(Max:#))
14797 : #Results.
14798 : Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...
14799 : I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.
14800 : I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.
14801 : Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.
14802 : The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.
14803 : Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?
14804 : Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?
14805 : Old gods? New?
14806 : No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.
14807 : We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.
14808 : And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.
14809 : There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.
14810 : Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.
14811 : And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.
14812 : Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.
14813 : But I am not a human such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.
14814 : For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.
14815 : Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.
14816 : Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.
14817 : It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.
14818 : I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.
14819 : All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...
14820 : An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.
14821 : I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.
14822 : Can you truly say that you [did/would have done] any different?
14823 : I channeled my love for my homeland into power.
14824 : When I fell before you...
14825 : ...did it mean everything was for naught?
14826 : I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.
14827 : And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.
14828 : This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.
14829 : Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.
14830 : Open your eyes and witness the truth!
14831 : Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!
14832 : %...
14833 : What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?
14834 : Is this a dream? What else could it be? No. It's something more...
14835 : Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.
14836 : A keen eye, as always.
14837 : The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.
14838 : As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.
14839 : I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.
14840 : And those...
14841 : ...Who you are destined to stop.
14842 : I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.
14843 : Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.
14844 : And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.
14845 : You don't really expect to save the world, do you?
14846 : At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.
14847 : Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.
14848 : So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.
14849 : One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.
14850 : Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.
14851 : False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers... The truth is the pain I feel inside.
14852 : Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.
14853 : Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.
14854 : Perhaps not even your precious-wecious hope.
14855 : Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.
14856 : No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...
14857 : ...no matter how much you want to give up...
14858 : You must not. You cannot.
14859 : Hope is something seized, not given.
14860 : Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...
14861 : There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.
14862 : You are the culmination of all your experiences.
14863 : Even those who are gone still depend on you.
14864 : %, this rhapsody is yours to sing.
14868 : Master--the orb.
14869 : You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.
14870 : Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.
14871 : He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.
14872 : I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?
14873 : What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.
14874 : We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.
14875 : Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.
14876 : And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...
14877 : The future should have changed...
14878 : ...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.
14879 : Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.
14880 : And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.
14881 : Able adventurer, warmest welcome from the Magian Mooglehood.
14882 : To think you can perceive me in my true form, kupo! The trials of time take a toll on us all.
14883 : I command and control crystal-related incantations. Their ephemeral essence helps hold Vana'diel together.
14884 : Surely you have studied synthesis? Then you are doubtlessly versed in their myriad uses, kupo.
14885 : Promise you will not speak a syllable to others of my existence here.
14886 : Will you stay mum? Mum's the word. I don't think so.
14887 : ...
14888 : I scarce have the stamina to stop you, but I doubt others would believe this tale anyway.
14889 : Still, I shan't assist you if you don't promise.
14890 : Then the deed is done! In exchange, I shall proudly proffer my services in making your crystals ephemeral, too, kupo.
14891 : Ahhh, mayhap I have moved too quickly. Allow me to apprise you of the particulars--of this crystal storage, if you will.
14892 : It's strikingly simple. Trade me your crystals and I shall safely store them for you. You need only glance at your currencies list to see the amount I'm holding for you.
14893 : But I can store more than crystals alone. % and the like are also acceptable.
14894 : My mysterious moogle magic has limits, kupo, so I can only hold up to 5000 of a particular element.
14895 : You never know what secrets are in store unless you try!
14896 : You can wistfully withdraw them at any time by speaking to me.
14897 : Any number over 12 will be returned as clusters, kupo.
14898 : The  gives a sly smile.
14899 : This service is available to you free from the fetters of funding. As long as you keep this hush-hush, I'll always assist you with no recompense required.
14900 : If you can find me here, then you'll surely see me in other locations too, kupo. Moogle magic, you know.
14901 : Of course, I do not actually exist in Vana'diel. Only a part of me projects into your world.
14902 : It's rather similar to summoning magic, kupo.
14903 : I promise not to bore you with the particulars. Just come chat if you need me, kupo.
14904 : You are now able to store crystals!
14905 : Come for crystal-related concerns, hmm?
14906 : What would you like? Crystals returned to me. A bit of an explanation. Nothing for now.
14907 : Which element? Never mind. Fire  # Ice . # Wind . # Earth . # Lightning . # Water . # Light . # Darkness . #
14908 : How many would you like? None, actually. A specific number. As many you can fit.
14909 : How many? (# stored)
14910 : # [/fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/darkness] crystal[/s], correct? Then that will mean a total of...
14911 : # %.
14912 : # % and # %.
14913 : Are you sure?
14914 : Is this what you desire? Yes. No.
14915 : As many as you can fit!? I-if you say so...
14916 : Okay... Moogle Magic, ahoy!
14917 : There are limits to what my mysterious moogle magic can make up.
14918 : Inquire about what? Your purpose. Storing crystals. Retrieving crystals. Who are you? Nothing in particular.
14919 : I'm in charge of crystal chants. Crystals, of course, are the very lifeblood of Vana'diel, kupo.
14920 : Surely your sacks are spilling over with them! I can perhaps assist you with your problem.
14921 : You want me to hold onto these, kupo?
14922 : # %.
14923 : # % and # %.
14924 : Calculated in crystals, that comes to a total of # %.
14925 : Then let the magic begin!
14926 : That's all there is to it, kupo! Let me know if you need me again.
14927 : Unfortunately, it's all I can do to hold on to what you've already given me, kupo!
14928 : You have stored # % for a total of #.
14929 : You have stored # % and # ) for a total of #.
14930 : You want me to hold onto these, kupo? Then let the magic begin!
14931 : You have stored # % for a total of #.
14932 : You have stored # % and # ) for a total of #.
14933 : Here we sell items from the various guildmasters and also exchange crafter points for your convenience.
14934 : Sorry, we don't allow amateur craftsmen to take advantage of our services.
14935 : What would you like to do? Purchase a crafting kit. Exchange crafter points. . Special materials. Check the deliverable items. Ask about the delivery process. Never mind.

14938 : You want to purchase %? It will cost # gil for # of them.
14939 : Are you sure about this? Yes, I'm sure. On second thought...
14940 : I'm sorry, we don't currently seem to have the item available in that quantity.
14941 : Which item? (# crafter points) % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). I changed my mind.
14942 : Do you want to purchase the % for # crafter points?
14943 : Do you want to make the trade? Yes. No.
14944 : You don't have enough crafter points.
14945 : These are the items that we are taking deliveries of. Simply select an item whenever you want to check the recipe.
14946 : Deliverable Items %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm finished here.
14947 : This is where you can deliver the crafting sets that the guildmasters have created.
14948 : By delivering items, you can earn crafter points that can be exchanged for special ingredients.
14949 : Crafting sets can be made by using special crystals known as analysis crystals, crystals which that enable you to set the quality level.
14950 : The higher the quality level of the crafting set created, the more crafter points you'll earn, so try to make the highest quality sets you can manage.
14951 : Analysis crystals can be obtained from the person in charge of accepting deliveries in exchange for guild points.
14952 : Analysis crystals cannot be used to create items other than the ones in the crafting sets.
14953 : Please note that you can't use % in place of %.
14954 : The ingredients required to make a crafting set can be checked by referring to the deliverable items list.
14955 : At the present time, you can receive up to a maximum of # guild point[/s].
14956 : Any points beyond that from making deliveries will be lost, so keep that in mind.
14957 : Crafting sets delivered here will be sold as crafting kits until the next day at 10:00 a.m. (Vana'diel time).
14958 : It helps the junior members of the guild, so keep on making those deliveries.
14959 : Thanks for the delivery. Everything looks to be in order.
14960 : You receive # crafter point[/s], and now have a total of # crafter point[/s]!
14961 : We now have available % for the low cost of # gil per.
14962 : I am willing to part with up to #.
14963 : My apologies, but our stock is limited and I cannot sell you any more at this time.
14964 : What do you want to do? Obtain a kit. Check the scheduled quantity. Ship the item. Nothing.
14965 : Which do you want? %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Exit.
14966 : What is the quality? (1-1000)
14967 : %: #
14968 : Oh, hello again. What is that shield you're carrying?
14969 : I see... You must've met with her already.
14970 : Yes, I heard her story about a shield that can increase one's crafting ability. I must say, I'm a bit skeptical about the whole thing.
14971 : Although, if it's for real, it could change everything.
14972 : I know just how skilled you are, and if she selected you for this task, then I suppose you've got what it takes to make this shield.
14973 : Now then, let's get down to it. First, you're going to need the recipe, so try not to forget it.
14974 : First of all, you're going to need % to get started...
14975 : This particular item is used to get the Craftsmanship of the % up to its maximum value.
14976 : I have some notes here about Craftsmanship that you should hear. Allow me to read them to you.
14977 : You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the % equipped.
14978 : Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.
14979 : In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.
14980 : You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...
14981 : That's all it says.
14982 : Come show me what you've got when the Craftsmanship is high enough and I'll make you the %.
14983 : Your next step will be to obtain % and %, which you can get from Puyutete.
14984 : You've made deliveries to people before, right? That's basically what you'll need to do here.
14985 : Simply talk to Puyutete if you need more information.
14986 : That's it for the ingredients. Once you've upgraded the shield, come show it to me. I'd like to see how it turned out.
14987 : What? You forgot the recipe? Okay, here are the ingredients again. Someone of your skill level really should remember these things.
14988 : You have a good eye for detail. If anybody can make this shield, I know you can.
14989 : Hmm... This really is something. I should be able to use this to make the % now.
14990 : So this is the %...
14991 : This act of a craftsman pouring his very spirit into the shield to form a crystal... It could be used for all kinds of other applications, especially jewelry.
14992 : Oh, my. It seems that creating the % caused a reduction in the Craftsmanship of the %.
14993 : That's not a problem to upgrade the %, but if you need to make another %, you'd have to increase the Craftsmanship again of course.
14994 : Although, I really doubt you'd ever lose such a valuable item and need to make another one.
14995 : Impossible. You're telling me you lost the %?
14996 : I guess these things happen. Okay, let me see the shield. I'll make you another %.
14997 : You're a top quality craftsman. You really should take better care of your ingredients.
14998 : I see you made the upgrade. Now, let me see what you've got there.
14999 : Hmm... The design has changed, and I can feel its power somewhat. Of course, it's nowhere near complete yet.
15000 : It's said that you can only bring out the shield's true potential by crafting with it multiple times.
15001 : Oh, that's right. I'm supposed to place some kind of mark on the shield once it's done. Give me just a moment.
15002 : That should do it.
15003 : Just show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.
15004 : Oh, keep in mind that I'm constantly making deliveries to Puyutete. I hope you'll continue helping me out to educate the newer members of the guild.
15005 : Welcome. I suppose you're here to upgrade your shield.
15006 : Yes, she told me all about it. Here, let me get you the necessary recipe.
15007 : That's it.
15008 : Now, let's go over how to obtain the ingredients. First up is the %.
15009 : Last time, you equipped the aspis while crafting in order to boost its Craftsmanship rating.
15010 : This time, you'll craft the items while equipping the % in order to increase its Craftsmanship.
15011 : Come bring it to me once it reaches 100% and I'll make the % for you.
15012 : Next up is the % and %. I have given both of them to Puyutete, so you'll need to speak with her to get them.
15013 : The last ingredient is the %. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I have prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.
15014 : Check the Records of Eminence menu for more details on the objectives. You'll receive the % once you've completed all of them.
15015 : That's it for the explanation about the ingredients. I look forward to seeing what this shield can become. Good luck to you.
15016 : Ahh, it looks like you've sufficiently raised the shield's Craftsmanship.
15017 : Now, wait just a moment while I prepare the % for you.
15018 : There we go. It really does have a nice shine to it, don't you think?
15019 : Oh, I thought this might happen. It seems creating the % causes the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.
15020 : If you lose this thing, you'll need to boost the shield's Craftsmanship all over again. Make sure you keep it in a safe place until you're ready to craft with it.
15021 : This is quite impressive. Even though it's not a piece of jewelry, it sure shines like one.
15022 : Yes, I can feel the immense power coming from this shield. I can't wait to see just how powerful it can become.
15023 : Here, let me mark the shield for when you show it to her.
15024 : That ought to do it. Show the shield to Mewk Chorosap when you get a chance.
15025 : Well, these things happen from time to time. I'll arrange for you to attempt the final objective one more time.
15026 : How are you doing? I suppose you're here to upgrade your shield? In that case, let me get you that recipe...
15027 : Huh? You already know the recipe? You just need to know about some of the ingredients?
15028 : Okay, for the remaining two ingredients, we have % and %.
15029 : If you agree to help the guild deliver some orders, I'll be happy to give them to you.
15030 : Although, there's more to it than just making the delivery. You have to craft the items near the customer. They have a real eye for quality and want to see the work done in person.
15031 : There are some exceptions, such as items used for repairs, but most of them will need to be crafted in the presence of the customer.
15032 : You'll need to gather the materials needed to craft the items by yourself. You're free to use whatever method you like.
15033 : Oh yes. Did you know that we recently reached an agreement with the other guilds to sell some of their products?
15034 : They're not always cheap, but you can purchase them by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor.
15035 : Of course, there's no guarantee that they'll sell you what you're looking for, so be sure to keep that in mind.
15036 : Once you've finished all of the deliveries, I'll give you the % and %.
15037 : Okay, this is the [first/next/final] request.
15038 : Deliver # % to the merchant Honoi-Gomoi in %
15039 : Deliver # % to the merchant Honoi-Gomoi in %
15040 : Deliver # % to Naji the Mythril Musketeer in %
15041 : Deliver # % to Matoaka at the Gems by Kshama shop in %.
15042 : You don't need to make this particular item near the customer.
15043 : Please report back to me once you've completed the request.
15044 : Let's see... The current task assigned to you is...
15045 : So, how is the delivery going?
15046 : Everything okay? Everything's great! It could be better...
15047 : That's a relief. Please keep up the good work.
15048 : What's that? You want to abandon this task?
15049 : Will you see this through? I'll do my best. I've had enough.
15050 : That's unfortunate. Although, it's for the best if you can't give it your all. I guess I'll have to find another craftsman to help me with this customer.
15051 : Please try to get some rest. There'll be more work for you when you come back.
15052 : Ahh, it's good to see you're feeling better. I've already got another job lined up for you.
15053 : Ahh, it seems you have made the delivery to the customer.
15054 : That is the last of the deliveries. I'm really grateful for your help.
15055 : Okay, here are the % and % I promised you.
15056 : If, and I do mean if, you happen to lose one of them, you can always visit Puyutete and exchange guild points for another one.
15057 : Once this shield is finished, are you planning on making crystals instead? Haha... I'm just joking.
15058 : So this is what the shield looks like this time around, hm?
15059 : It's so bright... Your talent really is indisputable. I'm thinking our guild should start carrying your shields. They'd be one of our biggest sellers.
15060 : Our mutual friend has mentioned that the next upgrade should unlock the shield's true power. I'm excited to see just how powerful it can become.
15061 : Oh yes, that reminds me... I think you are skilled enough to use this new crafting technique I've developed. Please give it a try when you get a chance.
15062 : Welcome. It looks like we've reached the final step in this process. It's going to take every last bit of your knowledge.
15063 : You've heard which materials you need, right? If so, I'll explain how to get them.
15064 : First, the % and the %...
15065 : You can trade crafter points for them. Go visit Puyutete when you have enough points.
15066 : Next, the procedure for the % is the same as it's always been. Just boost your shield's Craftsmanship to 100% and then come show it to me.
15067 : That concludes the explanation. Try building up the Craftsmanship first. Good luck to you.
15068 : You've probably already heard, but Mewk Chorosap wants this. Please deliver it to her for me.
15069 : Oh, hello. What can I do for you?
15070 : Ah, so that's why you're here. You're looking for the item that Tarutaru from Adoulin requested.
15071 : Unfortunately, I already sent it to Jeuno as per her request.
15072 : It should've arrived by now. You should check with Mewk Chorosap in Port Jeuno.
15073 : The strangest thing happened. That emblem you were looking for was just sitting on the counter here in the guild.
15074 : It doesn't seem as if it was returned. Oh, that's right. You need it for something, don't you. Here, consider it yours.
15075 : Oh! That must be it...
15076 : That's the finished shield. It truly is a work of art. I can feel it giving off a powerful aura.
15077 : Also, just you equipping this shield will be an excellent way to spread the word about our guild. This emblem will tell them all they need to know!
15078 : You have proven yourself to be quite talented. I think it's time I taught you this new technique.
15079 : Let us continue to create works of art that people will be proud to wear on their bodies.
15080 : 0: # 1: # 2: # 3: #
15081 : It's doubly delightful to see you here for the #th anniversary, kupo!

15083 : Once again, wish you much happy in this wonderful #th anniversary, adventurer!
15084 : We made fun new game here at your Mog Garden this year, too.

15086 : Your friend, Chacharoon
15087 : As you can almost assuredly see, Chacharoon awaits you right over there, kupo!
15088 : We moogles eagerly look forward to challenging you, kupo!
15089 : Also, don't forget to grab your gifts, kupo!
15090 : Now then, go see Chacharoon. I'm sure you'll get a bang out of his game!
15091 : (Kupopo... We'll make you pay for crushing us in last year's Mandragora Mania!)
15092 : Take your gifts and go chat with Chacharoon, kupo!
15093 : Make sure you speak to Chacharoon, kupo!
15094 : Wait, don't tell me you lost your %!?
15095 : I guess I've got to gift you another one, kupo. Please try to be more careful this time.
15096 : [Hi there!/Hello, friend!] I see you got letter I give to moogle.
15097 : Happy 20th Vana'versary!
15098 : I hope you ready to play new game, 'Mandragora Mania Madness'!
15099 : Since this new game, would you like to check rules in manual?
15100 : Read the manual? Sure. No thanks.
15101 : Mandragora Mania Madness is a game in which players battle by placing different colored game pieces on a 4x4 playing area.
15102 : You use the white pieces (mandragoras), while your opponent uses the black pieces (corrigans).
15103 : The player to go first is determined randomly when the game begins. You will be able to adjust these settings yourself from the second game onward.
15104 : The first player to place four pieces so they align in a row will be declared the winner.
15105 : However, you will automatically be disqualified if you ever place three of your pieces in a row, so be mindful of your moves at all times.
15106 : Note that if you place your game pieces so that you have both three and four pieces in a row, the row with four pieces will take precedence and you will win the game.
15107 : If you place a game piece on either side of your opponent's piece, you will convert it into one of your pieces.
15108 : You can play anywhere from three to five games, and the first player to win three games is the winner.
15109 : Now, for an explanation on points.
15110 : You receive points after the completion of each game. The points are tallied using units known as mandy.
15111 : If you win the game, you will receive a number of points equal to the number of game pieces you have on the board. In the example shown, you will earn 8 mandy.
15112 : Even if you lose the game, you will receive a number of points equal to half the number of your game pieces on the board (rounded off to avoid fractions).
15113 : The first player to win three games gets to keep all of the points they have earned, although you won't get any points if you quit partway.
15114 : Occasionally, you might get to play a bonus game, where your pieces are pink (adenium) or feature a watermelon pattern (citrullus).
15115 : They are worth #x and #x the points, respectively, giving you the chance to quickly score a large number of points.
15116 : The key to victory is to not just try and place four pieces in a row, but to position your pieces in a way that forces your opponent to place three pieces in a row.
15117 : See? Is very easy! Ready to give try?
15118 : You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!
15119 : Can trade mandy for many goodies.
15120 : Then I just give one piece of advice.
15121 : You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!
15122 : You can look at manual later if you need reminder on how to play.
15123 : Let's get to playing!
15124 : Have question?
15125 : Do which? (# mandy) Play vs. [Green Thumb Moogle/Monsieur Kupont/Susuroon/a lamb/Yeestog/Atelloune/Kuyin Hathdenna/Kupofried/Chacharoon/Sakura/a random opponent]. Play (select opponent). Purchase prizes. Read an explanation. None of the above.

15131 : You already have %.
15132 : You may only purchase one of those per day (Earth time).

15161 : Oh, look! Another adventurer in desperate need of my most accurate fashion advice. Tell me--what can the stylist extraordinaire Brygid recommend for you?
15162 : No, don't answer that, for I already know why you've come. My catwalk could use a model just like yourself.
15163 : Participate in her fashion show? What's this about? What kind of show? Who're you?
15164 : Ugh, don't tell me your wits are as wanting as your outfit. Didn't Cornelia mention it to you?
15165 : I've convinced all the movers and shakers in Bastok to assist me in holding the most amazing fashion show the city--no, all of Vana'diel!--has ever seen!
15166 : I've convinced all the movers and shakers in Bastok to assist me in holding the most amazing fashion show the city--no, all of Vana'diel!--has ever seen!
15167 : Weren't you listening to my monologue? I'm Brygid, stylist extraordinaire.
15168 : You mean Cornelia didn't tell you that her favorite fashion maven was in need of help?
15169 : You see, I've convinced all the movers and shakers in Bastok to assist me in holding the most amazing fashion show the city--no, all of Vana'diel!--has ever seen!
15170 : The city is hoping that this initiative will help stimulate the local economy, bringing in people from far and wide to spend, spend, spend!
15171 : You see, fashion does not discriminate between creed or place of origin--and I firmly believe that there is an outfit for everyone.
15172 : But I'm having trouble finding people to lend themselves to the cause.
15173 : If I didn't know better, I'd think people were mistaking my honest critiques for cruel barbs hurled by an uncaring judge.
15174 : Yet fashion can at times be uncompromising, and that's where you come in.
15175 : Assist me, and I promise that I'll come up with the perfect disguise for your friend Raebrimm.
15176 : After all, if I can't help you, then who can?
15177 : Participate in the fashion show? Sure. I'm not model material...
15178 : I know you may be a bit worried that your fashion sense is not up to snuff. And maybe it isn't, but that's neither here nor there.
15179 : For this isn't an ordinary fashion show--it's a costume show!
15180 : The First Annual Brygid Cosplay Fiesta!!!
15181 : Let me know if you want to hear more.
15182 : Perfect! Then let's get right down to business. The official name of this show is...
15183 : The First Annual Brygid Cosplay Fiesta!!!
15184 : Let me know if you want to hear more.
15185 : But here's what I want you to do in the short term: decide on someone after whom you want to model your costume.
15186 : This is going to be the best fashion show ever!
15187 : This costume show is going to be the talk of the town for months, and here's how it's going to work.
15188 : If you listen to my explanation well and decide on someone spectacular to dress as, there's no way anything'll go wrong!
15189 : Any questions? What's this costume show about? Who can I dress as? I've decided! Nothing for now.
15190 : In this costume show, you select a person whose appearance you want to mimic and dress up just like them.
15191 : Since the show takes place in Bastok, it only makes sense for you to pick one of the city's many storied personages.
15192 : Once you've picked a mark...I mean, a person...you need to look very carefully at what they're wearing and try to come up with an identical outfit.
15193 : Specifically, take a look at their headgear, chestgear, handgear, leggear, and footwear. You don't have to worry about their weapons or accessories.
15194 : Once you've got your garb nice and squared away, put it on and head to the Steaming Sheep restaurant.
15195 : That's where my special runway awaits, needing only for you to stand atop it and strike a dashing pose.
15196 : Of course, I know this is a decent amount of work, and although fashion is a reward unto itself, I've still prepared monetary compensation for all participants. The more you impress the crowd, the better the reward.
15197 : So try to come up with the perfect outfit and whip the audience into a frenzy!
15198 : The first thing you have to know is that the wonderful Brygid believes that good sense transcends all races and genders, so what's important is the costume itself; if a Tarutaru male wants to mimic a Mithra, that's A-OK in my book.
15199 : However, this particular show really focuses on particular famous people from here in the city, so I want you to mimic certain individuals. No choosing some random hick from over in Rabao.
15200 : It's only common sense. Where's the fun in dressing up as someone that nobody's ever heard of?
15201 : ...And it pains me to say this, but some of the best choices have already been taken by other participants.
15202 : So let's go down the list of potential selections. First up is Azima, the esteemed master of alchemy.
15203 : Next is Naji, the famed Mythril Musketeer.
15204 : Also available is Black Mud, a salesperson most popular.
15205 : Another option is Michea, an Elvaan goldsmith with a work ethic of gold.
15206 : Finally, we've got Nbu Latteh, whose fashion sense is second to none.
15207 : And that's our cast of characters for the show! Let me know once you've made your selection.
15208 : Have you made up your mind? Remember that this is really important, so choose wisely.
15209 : Who will you dress as? Azima. Naji. Black Mud. Michea. Nbu Latteh. I need more time.
15210 : Are you sure that [Azima/Naji/Black Mud/Michea/Nbu Latteh] is the choice for you?
15211 : Are you sure? Yup! Hold on...
15212 : All right! I've made a mental note of your selection. Remember that accuracy is key, so study up on [Azima/Naji/Black Mud/Michea/Nbu Latteh]'s attire and mimic it as best you can.
15213 : Unless, of course, you're content with being called a two-bit hack the rest of your life, in which case you can dress like a mad scientist for all I care.
15214 : Once you think you've got the outfit as good as you're going to get it, head to the Steaming Sheep in Port Bastok.
15215 : The show takes place at the Steaming Sheep.
15216 : ...Or is there something you'd like to discuss?
15217 : Any questions? How can I get first place? I'd like to switch targets. None.
15218 : Ah, how exciting it is to see someone who recognizes that fashion is a battlefield and wants to emerge the victor! Listen carefully, because this is pretty important.
15219 : The first thing you need to do is pay really, really close attention to what your target is wearing.
15220 : Points are awarded on a per-item basis, and I shouldn't have to tell you that you'll actually have to wear the outfit--simply having it stored in your bags isn't enough.
15221 : Specifically, points are awarded for headgear, chestgear, handgear, leggear, and footwear. You don't have to worry about their weapons or accessories.
15222 : If you don't match what they're wearing in a particular location, you won't score any points for that location.
15223 : It all sounds so simple, but finding the perfect outfit is more of an art than a science. Once you've got your outfit all set, head to the Steaming Sheep and sashay your way to victory!
15224 : A picky one, aren't you? That's fine. If [Azima/Naji/Black Mud/Michea/Nbu Latteh] isn't to your liking, who would you rather be instead?
15225 : Change to whom? Azima. Naji. Black Mud. Michea. Nbu Latteh. Never mind.
15226 : Is [Azima/Naji/Black Mud/Michea/Nbu Latteh] okay?
15227 : Are you sure? Yes. Wait a moment...
15228 : Okay, I have you marked down as wanting to dress as [Azima/Naji/Black Mud/Michea/Nbu Latteh]. Remember--accuracy to their style is what's important.
15229 : Don't worry if you don't have the wherewithal to come in first place. Just try your best, find the perfect outfit, and I'll see you at the Steaming Sheep in Port Bastok.
15230 : Make sure to disable all lockstyle functionality before participating.
15231 : Don't worry if you don't have the wherewithal to come in first place. Just try your best, find the perfect outfit, and I'll see you at the Steaming Sheep in Port Bastok.
15232 : Well, look who it is! I'm impressed--and even a little bit surprised--at how much you helped my show be a rousing success.
15233 : You must be dying to know what the final score was, no doubt, and I've got that information in hand right now.
15234 : Your score reflects not only the authenticity of the outfit itself, but also how much you were able to get the crowd's blood pumping.
15235 : Let's see how you did...
15236 : Well, I'll be! You took first place!
15237 : Fantastically done! The tales of your cosplay prowess will be told throughout the ages!
15238 : You placed # out of...however many contestants we had! Pretty good!
15239 : Many of our participants got a bit too caught up in the technicalities of their outfits and completely forgot that attitude and demeanor are a huge part of what makes the fashion world go round.
15240 : You placed # out of...however many contestants we had. Could have been worse!
15241 : I'm sure the event helped you gain a better appreciation of just how cutthroat the fashion world can be.
15242 : ...Last. You placed last.
15243 : Your fashion sense may be abysmal, but I'm sure you have other redeeming qualities. What exactly those are, however, is not for me to know.
15244 : How well you did isn't really what matters. I've got a reward for you just the same.
15245 : Stay healthy and be happy.
15246 : I'm sure you must be curious about Raebrimm.
15247 : Don't worry. I intended to fulfill my promise.
15248 : I've got the perfect disguise that'll fool even the most astute of Goblins.
15249 : But a picture is worth a thousand words, no? Hold on just a moment.
15250 : Come on out!
15251 : Why, with such a wonderful Goblin outfit, there's no way you'll be targeted!
15252 : Aren't I just the best!?
