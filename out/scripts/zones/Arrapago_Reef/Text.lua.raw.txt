6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7365 : They can't keep me cooped up in here! I'm lucky I equipped some of my shop's goods... This place is so cold and creepy.
7366 : I owe you one! I'm sure my fans are waiting for me, so I had better get back before they do something drastic!
7367 : Heeey, I recognize you. I owe my success to you! Here, you've earned this!

7371 : A-another person? Please help me! I can't stand this place...too much sea...I'm more of a mountain person...
7372 : Thank you! I run a shop that sells magic scrolls...but I can't use magic... Drop by if you're ever in the area.

7380 : Chayaya's Projectiles! Get your darts and more at Chayaya's Projectiles! Just don't touch the stuff in the high drawers, okay?
7381 : Well now, I wonder where this is. I hope my chocobos are somehow getting along without me.
7382 : I wonder how my chocobos will fare while I am locked up here...
7383 : I wonder how much time has passed since I was captured. I am quite worried about my chocobos...
7384 : You have my utmost gratitude. I must return to town and feed my chocobos before they grow hungry.
7385 : You are the adventurer who saved me, are you not? I have been waiting to meet again so I could give you this.
7386 : The Chocobo Stables are currently not open. Please come back later.

7391 : Nice adventooorer save Chochoroon, yes? Chochoroon very happy. Chochoroon give yooo present.
7392 : This place gives me the creeps. I should've practiced using teleportation magic on myself!
7393 : This place is going to make me melt into a puddle. I bet if you were stuck in here, you could use magic and make a grand escape, but me...
7394 : This place is going to freeze me into a block of sub-zero gelato. I bet you could warm yourself up with fire magic, but me...
7395 : I don't know who you are, but you're the nicest person I ever met! Thank you!
7396 : You saved me earlier! Thank you very much! You can have this...for free!
7397 : As I was being dragged to this dreadful place, I noticed many questionable decorations about the area. I wonder if those are a type of charm against evil...
7398 : As I sit in this cage and reflect, I feel the true darkness creeping ever closer... I must return to town at once.
7399 : There's something foul in the air here. Can you not feel it? The true darkness is approaching.
7400 : I give you my thanks, adventurer. I must now make haste back to town, where I can help ward off the darkness. We shall meet again.
7401 : You saved me from my shadowy prison. Thank you. I have no wards against the darkness now, so I am afraid you must settle with this.
7402 : This is terrible... How will the auction house in Al Zahbi ever function without me?
7403 : This is awful... Who will take care of the auction house while I'm gone?
7404 : This is horrible... I've still got the keys to the auction house in my pocket! Noone'll be able to get in without them!
7405 : Thank you! Now I can go back to town and reopen the auction house!
7406 : I was beginning to think the auction house was going to have to shut down for good...until you saved me. Please accept my thanks.
7407 : This auction house is renowned for its low transaction fees, and the fact that it's connected to Jeuno makes it extremely convenient!
7408 : I was sure I could overpower the beastmen, but they were just too strong... I must strive harder if I am to face my followers again.
7409 : I was planning to build my strength from morning until night...but all my power turned out to be useless when I really needed it.
7410 : You've fought the beastmen so many times they don't even make a scratch on you now, right?
7411 : Thank you. I've realized now that I must train the mind as well as the body. I must return and share this revelation!
7412 : Thank you for freeing me earlier. I have decided to train both my body and mind from now on. Please accept this as gratitude.
7413 : See how hard my students are working? It brings me great pleasure each day to see how much they are growing under my guidance.
7414 : I would be devastated if anything were to happen to Her Magnificence while I was confined! You must help me!
7415 : The Serpent Generals are under my guidance, and all I can do is wile away the days as Her Magnificence remains unguarded!
7416 : Who will protect the Empress while I am wiling away in this prison? Even perishing here would not absolve me if she is hurt!
7417 : Praise be to you! I shall return now and ensure the Empress's safety. May she reign a thousand years!
7418 : Her Magnificence the Empress is safely shielded now, and it is all thanks to your efforts. You have the makings of a hero.
7419 : The mercenaries and the Imperial Army shall fight and perish as one to shield the Empress from harm!
7420 : May Her Magnificence reign a thousand years!
7421 : My presence was all for naught... My failure to protect the Astral Candescence is a transgression worthy of a thousand deaths...
7422 : Hear my plea... You mercenaries may be all that I can trust. Recover the Astral Candescence and bring it safely back to Al Zahbi...I implore you!
7423 : Ah, [/Private Second Class /Private First Class /Superior Private /Lance Corporal /Corporal /Sergeant /Sergeant Major /Chief Sergeant /Second Lieutenant /First Lieutenant /Captain ]%! It is reassuring indeed to have such a mighty ally to aid in the defense of Al Zahbi.
7424 : I am honored to fight at your side in the name of Her Magnificence!
7425 : Foul lizards, I damn you! Go ahead and bask in your victory. It shall be your last!
7426 : Damn you foolish Trolls! When I get out of here, I shall bathe your dwellings in scarlet!
7427 : You are not undead, are you? Release me from this prison now! I shall make ashes from those witches!
7428 : ... I shall not praise you for fulfilling your duty. I will take your name, though.
7429 : %, is it? This should please you...
7430 : You are a mercenary, are you?
7431 : Hmph, filthy money-grubbers. Those who are controlled by money are eventually betrayed by it.
7432 : Damn those spineless Imperial soldiers! How could they let the Astral Candescence slip out right under their very noses!?
7433 : ...Hm? You! Yes, you! What do you think you're staring at, anyway? Go get the Astral Candescence back, and now!
7434 : Ugh, you again. I have no patience for the mercenary mentality.
7435 : But you do show some skill in battle. I'll give you that much, %...
7436 : I'm going to be stuck in here forrrever... I'll never get out like this...
7437 : What if they'rrre planning to drag me off to the headsman? I...I'm scared...
7438 : My knees start to wobble at the mere thought of those eerrrie fish people... I can't even move...
7439 : What do you want? I was just about to bust out of there myself!
7440 : Oh, I rrremember you. Here, this is for you.
7441 : I-I'm not thanking you for anything. Don't get the wrrrong idea. This is just to cover the costs of your journey.
7442 : Leave me alone. I can't stand merrrcenaries.
7443 : Just make sure you don't get in our way when we're rrripping up the battlefield.
7444 : How am I going to get out of this...? The...the...Astral Candescence... What'll I tell the Empress...?
7445 : ...What!? I don't need you merrrcenaries' help. I could take the Astral Candescence back with both hands tied behind my back!
7446 : Hmph, just because you think you know a thing or two about me now doesn't mean I like you.
7447 : I am a generrral. You are a mercenary. Rrremember your station.
7448 : Hey, lizard people! I'm going to start breaking things if I don't get some food in here soon!
7449 : Damn, it's hot in here... Hey, pipsqueak! Yes, you! Get me out of here before I dry up like a date!
7450 : I've still got life in my bones! Unlike you mindless corpses, I need sustenance to keep moving!
7451 : Gahahaha! You were a living person after all! I can't believe that of all people, a mercenary saved my hide!
7452 : Hey, you're the [man/woman] who braved the beastmen to save me earlier, aren't you? Thank you! This is for you.
7453 : When the beastmen invade, make sure you get behind us while we decimate the enemy. We wouldn't want you getting hurt now, would we?
7454 : Gahahaha!
7455 : Damn, we lost bad, didn't we? They even managed to take the Astral Candescence... But it's times like these...
7456 : Gahahaha! ...that we should laugh in the face of fate and take back what's ours!
7457 : Oho, it's you! This battle will be over in time for lunch, then. I hate to miss a meal!
7458 : Gahahaha!
7459 : That scent... You are a person, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!
7460 : Those footsteps... You are a person, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!
7461 : The sound of breathing... You are a living being, are you not? I am Najelith of the Galeserpent. I bid you, release me from this prison!
7462 : Many thanks. I am Najelith of the Galeserpent--one of the five Serpent Generals. I owe my escape to you.
7463 : Thanks to your heroic rescue, I was able to safely return to my post. I would like to show you my gratitude with this gift.
7464 : We Serpent Generals will defend Al Zahbi with our lives.
7465 : The mercenaries also have an important role in protecting the Empire. Do not forget that.
7466 : The Astral Candescence is the Empress's treasure, the hope of our nation, and the bond between us...
7467 : %... I must stay here for the capital's defense... So I beg of you, please recapture the Astral Candescence for Aht Urhgan!
7468 : %, you are here to lend your strength to our defenses?
7469 : Then let us drive back the beastmen, shoulder to shoulder!

7485 : You must move closer.
7486 : The gate is firmly shut.
7487 : Use the %? Yes. No.
7488 : Looking closely, you see a red bell-type symbol painted on the wood...
7489 : You ring the red bell and hear the dull sound of something being unlocked...
7490 : Looking closely at the surface of the gate, you can see what appears to be the imprints of a Troll's fist...
7491 : You rap on the gate using the same pattern you saw in the pictographs. You hear the creaking sound of a bar lifting on the other side of the gate.
7492 : Listening closely, you can faintly hear the melancholy singing voice of a woman...
7493 : All of a sudden, the tiny Merrow begins to sing... I have longed to sing for you...the fleeting nature of life... The other side of the door grows silent, and then you hear a voice... Enter, foolish ones who fear us not...
7494 : The Astral Candescence appears to be unharmed...

7502 : All non-combatants in the Commoners' Ward are to evacuate immediately! Repeating... All non-combatants in the Commoners' Ward are to evacuate immediately!
7503 : The enemy is just outside our walls! All who can fight, take up your weapons and protect the gate!
7504 : Imperial Defense Force, at your positions! Do not let the beastmen near the Hall of Binding!
7505 : Fellow combatants!
7506 : The future of the Empire rests on your shoulders!
7507 : May we be victorious and bring glory to the Empress this day!
7508 : Gahahaha!
7509 : So our enemies think they've already won, do they?
7510 : I'll teach them a lesson!
7511 : Everyone, lend me your courage.
7512 : If only we put our trust in each other...
7513 : ...we can triumph over this threat!
7514 : Will the Empire thrive? Or fall into ruin?
7515 : Well? Fight and see!
7516 : War and perish, minions! Feed all your fury and desperation into the fray!

7532 : Let us celebrate our victory!
7533 : Damn, they retreated...

7925 : I will bestow upon you the Empire's Sanction. Good luck.
7926 : The Astral Candescence is now in Al Zahbi, so you will receive an experience bonus from battles. You can also select one of the following bonuses in exchange for a slight decrease in your Imperial Standing.
7927 : Choose a bonus for # [credit/credits]? Not now. Regen. Refresh. Increased meal duration.

7951 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Sanction. Imperial Standing. Besieged.
7952 : What about Besieged? Never mind. Besieged basics. Serpent Generals. Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi. Astral Candescence with beastmen. Empire's current state of defense.
7953 : Sanction is a magic spell that we use to observe and assess mercenaries' actions.
7954 : Defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you will raise your Imperial Standing. Also, the stronger the monsters you fight, the higher your Imperial Standing will become.
7955 : When fighting in a beastman stronghold that has taken the Astral Candescence, your Imperial Standing will rise by a significant amount as thanks for your participation in the recovery effort.
7956 : Sanction is also necessary in order to receive crystals from the enemies you defeat.
7957 : But you must take caution. Stepping too far out of the Empire's boundaries will cause Sanction to wear off.
7958 : You can raise your Imperial Standing by defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you.
7959 : Saving a captured prisoner in a beastman stronghold and submitting archaic mirrors to Imperial guards will also result in an increased Imperial Standing.
7960 : You can view your Imperial Standing by selecting Besieged under Region Info.
7961 : You can also speak to me at any time to exchange your Imperial Standing credits for items.
7962 : Besieged occurs when the beastman armies breach the walls of Al Zahbi.
7963 : Everyone in town who is capable of wielding a weapon is called to action to defend Al Zahbi alongside the Imperial Army.
7964 : The beastmen's main purpose is to enter the Hall of Binding and wrest the Astral Candescence from the Empire's control.
7965 : You need not know what the Astral Candescence is.
7966 : All you must know is that it is your duty to protect the five Serpent Generals who hold the keys to the Hall of Binding, and to drive the beastman hordes from the Imperial capital.
7967 : The Empire's safety and its future rest on your capable shoulders! Rest assured that you will be rewarded for your efforts.
7968 : The Empire's defense is entrusted to five generals.
7969 : Each possesses a name corresponding to the symbols of the Empire--the serpents of flame, water, stone, gales, and sky.
7970 : Furthermore, the mirrors used to open the Hall of Binding are divided among their possession. Thus, the generals' fates determine the tide of battle.
7971 : If all five generals should fall in battle, the Hall of Binding will open, and the beastmen will be able to seize the Astral Candescence.
7972 : It is your responsibility to prevent such a disaster from happening. We are depending on you!
7973 : When the Astral Candescence is safely resting on its plinth in the Hall of Binding, it emanates waves that bestow special bonuses to Sanction.
7974 : The first bonus is a slight boost to the amount of experience points received from battles. You will receive this effect simply by having Sanction cast on you.
7975 : There are several other bonus effects, but you must sacrifice some of your Imperial Standing credits in order to receive them.
7976 : Keep in mind that the bonuses become more powerful with the number of times the Imperial capital is successfully defended.
7977 : Sanction's strength will reset if the beastmen succeed in invading the Hall of Binding, though.
7978 : The waves emanating from the Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi bring a multitude of blessings to all of us. You must not let it fall into the hands of the beastmen!
7979 : If the beastmen manage to take the Astral Candescence, its recovery will become our top priority. Find the coveted item on a plinth in one of the beastman strongholds and seize it back for the Empire!
7980 : We aren't quite sure what the beastmen are scheming to do with such power, but we do know that the Astral Candescence's waves can increase the beastmen's strength.
7981 : As if that weren't enough, we have recent reports that the beastmen have set archaic mirrors in their strongholds to magnify the power of the waves.
7982 : If you should come across any archaic mirrors, take them immediately and trade them to an Imperial guard.
7983 : Al Zahbi has been successively victorious in # [battle/battles] to defend the capital, bringing the Imperial defense to a value of #. The Imperial capital has seen # [victory/victories] overall, and the Astral Candescence has been seized by the beastmen a total of # [time/times].
7984 : You do not possess the # [Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits] required to fully recharge the %.
7985 : Please be aware that you can only recharge % once during the period between each Conquest tally.
7986 : The % is already fully charged.
7987 : Your % has received # [charge/charges] in exchange for # [Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits]. It is now fully recharged.
7988 : There is no response. You cannot escape!
7989 : You have broken the clear time record for [Lamia Reprisal/]!
7990 : The current battlefield clear time record for [Lamia Reprisal/] is # second[/s].
7991 : The current battlefield clear time record for [Lamia Reprisal/] is # minute[/s] # second[/s].
7992 : Entering the battlefield for [Lamia Reprisal/]!
7993 : Which battlefield will you enter? None. Lamia Reprisal.
7994 : If you listen closely, you can faintly hear female voices singing in rounds from the other side of the gate...
7995 : All of a sudden, the tiny Merrow and Lamia begin to sing... Eternal love...awaits you...after the dream. The other side of the gate grows silent, and then you hear a voice... Enter, repulsive ones who would peddle their souls...
7996 : The % and % run away snickering as the flasks simultaneously crumble into dust...

8022 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
8023 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
8024 : Now, listen close...
8025 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
8026 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...

8036 : Brother! You're alright!
8037 : Wasuhd... What are you doing here?
8038 : You're a mercenary? Or an adventurer? Why did you help my brother?
8039 : ...I apologize. The important thing is that you did help out. Thank you.
8040 : Wooow! This is the first time I've seen a real corsair! You look even cooler than I imagined!
8041 : You need to go home. Dad must be worried sick about you.
8042 : No way! I'm gonna become a corsair!
8043 : What?
8044 : What's a kid doing here, Mutihb?
8045 : He's my little brother.
8046 : ...Who's the scary old lady?
8047 : Show some respect! This is Zweeha, the Seagull Phratrie's second in command!
8048 : Wow, really!?
8049 : N-nice to meet you. I want to become a c-corsair, too.
8050 : ...
8051 : Hey Zweeha, the guy on the wall... That was Quick-Fire Qultada, right?
8052 : I know about him! He's the captain of the Seagull Phratrie!
8053 : Wow, that last flash bomb was sooo scary! I'm still seeing spots!
8054 : Good work, everyone. It was a complete success, thanks to your efforts.
8055 : There's just one thing that bothers me...
8056 : What's that?
8057 : I was talking to Qultada and he pointed out...
8058 : ...that the Immortals showed up altogether too quickly.
8059 : I do not want to believe it, but it does seem to suggest...
8060 : ...Do you mean to say that someone is giving them inside information?
8061 : Lady Zweeha, the Immortals are setting out to Mamook.
8062 : Are you certain, Gowam?
8063 : Yes, my lady, beyond the shadow of a doubt. I overheard a conversation when we entered the town to save Mutihb.
8064 : They were talking about launching an offensive on the Savagelands.
8065 : Good work, Gowam. I will inform Qultada. Seagulls, prepare for battle!
8066 : Yes, ma'am!
8067 : You go home.
8068 : Whaaat? Why!?
8069 : Do you expect us to drag a kid out to battle?
8070 : And you. You're an adventurer, right? Naja's got you under her thumb, doesn't she?
8071 : And this [man/woman]. The Immortals are blue mages, and you have the nerve to bring one here! Simply revolting.
8072 : And you. You're a mercenary, right? You're a lapdog of the Empire!
8073 : But [he/she] isn't a bad [man/woman]! [He/She] searched all over Whitegate just to find me! Oh, come on... You just gotta let me join the Seagull Phratrie!
8074 : Enough of this nonsense! Get out of here before Qultada sees you!
8075 : Come on, [mister/lady]... Can't you convince her to let us stay?
8076 : You came here to become a corsair too, didn't you?
8077 : Do you want to become a corsair? I do! Not really.
8078 : Liar!
8079 : We do come across people like you occasionally.
8080 : But words will not get you into the Seagull Phratrie.
8081 : We favor action.
8082 : If you are serious, you must venture to the land where our ancestors, the corsairs, perished in times past, and bring us an item that proves your courage and resolution.
8083 : Then we can talk.
8084 : Wasuhd... Are you serious about becoming a corsair?
8085 : Of course!
8086 : Father's going to get angry with me all over again...
8087 : But so be it. Anyway, you must first pass Zweeha's test.
8088 : The corsairs are a free assembly. Race and status mean nothing here. The only thing that matters is strength of will.
8089 : As long as you can prove your courage and resolution, they're sure to accept you as one of us.
8090 : The land where the corsairs perished... I think she may be referring to Talacca Cove.
8091 : This is your test. I can't help you out...
8092 : But I can wish you the best of luck, Wasuhd.
8093 : Thanks!
8094 : Who goes there? I hope you are aware of what happens to trespassers.
8095 : %? It has been long since we last met.
8096 : I was beginning to think you headed back to the Middle Lands because Aht Urhgan was too rough for you.
8097 : Don't listen to her. She was worried sick about you.
8098 : Aznahf, I hear the sharks are craving red-haired Elvaan as of late...
8099 : P-please forgive me, Lady Zweeha!
8100 : Frivolous chatter is forbidden in the Seagull Phratrie. You would do well to remember that too, %.
8101 : Then again... You have become quite the corsair, haven't you?
8102 : Perhaps Qultada was right about you after all...
8103 : %, the scent of the sea is nothing new to you now... I think it's time for you to take the pledge.
8104 : Take the pledge? What pledge? No thanks.
8105 : How could you be a corsair this long without knowing about the pledge!?
8106 : How can you just refuse something you don't even understand?
8107 : The corsair's pledge is...um...
8108 : The pledge makes you an official member of the crew... It professes your loyalty to your shipmates and obedience to the captain, binding your fates together...
8109 : Captain Qultada!
8110 : You swear an oath to the goddess that you will have the courage not to back down from any storm, no matter how rough.
8111 : It is said that when a corsair has not taken the pledge, the goddess grows angry and the skies and seas grow tempestuous...
8112 : The bonds between crewmates and obedience to the captain are the pillars of the corsair's life on the perrrilous ocean. That's why it's so important to take the pledge and affirm your commitments!
8113 : Not so fast. Just look at %. [He/She] is unpresentable for such a ceremony.
8114 : What would you have [him/her] do? You can't exactly buy that kind of equipment at a shop...
8115 : And you can't even make one yourself without %...
8116 : Surely you're not advising [him/her] to give up before the battle has even begun. What kind of example would that make?
8117 : A true corsair would never give up so easily.
8118 : Where there is a will, there is a way. Now we must put forth all our effort into finding that way.
8119 : Tell me, %. You are from the Middle Lands, are you not?
8120 : The auction houses of Aht Urhgan are linked with Jeuno.
8121 : There are certain goods that are of nearly no worth here, but are highly valuable in your homeland, and the opposite is also common, is it not?
8122 : I see... [He/She] may be able to acquire one in the Middle Lands.
8123 : You can make use of your connections there, too. Just follow your intuition.
8124 : Ah, I've got it!
8125 : What is it now?
8126 : I just remembered a rumor I heard about a Mithran pirate who once lived in seclusion somewhere on the Mindartian continent...
8127 : I see. So % may be able to find % there... Do you know anything of the hideout's whereabouts?
8128 : The only thing I remember clearly is that it is supposedly located in a cave-like area...
8129 : Do you know any place like that? The Maze of Shakhrami. Gusgen Mines. Ordelle's Caves.
8130 : Hm... Now that you mention it, maybe that was the place... Then again, maybe not...
8131 : That's it!
8132 : I've heard information along those lines, anyway. It's worth checking out.
8133 : Excellent work, Aznahf.
8134 : Well then, %. You would be wise to verify this information, although you may have to travel far.
8135 : Hmph, just like a kid running off in search of excitement. I hope it all goes well, but [he/she] will need luck on [his/her] side.
8136 : I suppose [he/she] just started wanting something more... We were the same when we were young, Zweeha. Foolhardy and impetuous, searching out that something...
8137 : Heheheh. Now that you mention it, [he/she] does awfully resemble you when you were younger...
8138 : That's enough. I am a different person now.
8139 : Still... Thanks to %, I feel more light-hearted than I have in years.
8140 : Glad to see you are safe.
8141 : Judging by your expression, I would guess you found what you were looking for.
8142 : Good job, %. I knew you could do it.
8143 : Did you have something you wanted to tell me?
8144 : Give him Imutira's message? Yes. No way.
8145 : Odd. You looked like you had something to say...
8146 : Imutira... Are you positive she said her name was Imutira?
8147 : No, it's nothing.
8148 : Anyway, we have a more important matter to discuss. We need to get this % to a smith in Al Zahbi.
8149 : Do not worry. I have contacts with some highly skilled individuals.
8150 : I will ask that it be delivered to the Shararat Teahouse when finished, so go and have a sip of chai when you have time.
8151 : You have good timing. I was just looking for you, %.
8152 : Have you ever heard of %?
8153 : I see... Not that I expected you to, of course. The knowledge of its existence is limited even among the most experienced sailors.
8154 : You look curious, so let me explain...
8155 : % is used to create a highly detailed representation of the Near Eastern seas. It is somewhat like a seafloor mapping instrument.
8156 : The maze of reefs and the peculiar magnetic field around the Arrapago Islands have caused many a shipwreck. Mere compasses are of little use.
8157 : We have these natural obstructions to thank for keeping our base safe from intrusion.
8158 : However, without %, leaving this reef is nearly impossible.
8159 : Now, you may be wondering why I am telling you this...
8160 : We are currently attempting to restore the Seagull Phratrie's ship...
8161 : The Black Cradle.
8162 : She used to be a sight to behold. However, a while ago we ran into some trouble, and the ship ended up with a giant hole in her hull.
8163 : At that time, we also lost the most important part of all...the %.
8164 : Even if we were to finish reparations, leaving the reef would be virtually impossible. We could end up at the bottom of the ocean along with the ship if we are not careful...
8165 : %, I would appreciate it if you helped in the search. You are not wanted by the Empire, so you have the most freedom of us all.
8166 : % are very old and highly valuable. You will not be able to find one in any shop or at the auction house.
8167 : The ships of the ancient Kingdom of Ephramad all had one... Unfortunately, they are all lying on the bottom of the ocean now.
8168 : Still... If you do happen to find one by some wild stroke of luck, please give it to our lookout in Nashmau.
8169 : She has the most discerning eyes of anyone in the Phratrie.
8170 : All right? I know you can do this, %.
8171 : What is the meaning of this!?
8172 : You mean to tell me that Qultada went scampering off after some woman right after the % was stolen?
8173 : ...
8174 : Lady Zweeha, I await your command.
8175 : Hmph... I have no command for this.
8176 : The captain's leadership ability and navigational skills are top-notch, but everyone has a weakness.
8177 : This is absurd. Who could that fool of a captain have gone off with?
8178 : ...Imutira?
8179 : Imutira?
8180 : Don't be ridiculous. That girl was...
8181 : Lady Zweeha! We've got trouble!
8182 : What is it now?
8183 : It's Captain Qultada... Lady Zweeha, they say he is to be executed!
8184 : What is the meaning of this!?
8185 : People are whispering about it all over Al Zahbi.
8186 : Could Imutira be behind this...?
8187 : You are still new to the Phratrie, correct? So Imutira was before your time...
8188 : Imutira and her brother Jahqib...
8189 : They were both members of the Seagull Phratrie.
8190 : Until they were swallowed by the ocean, that is...
8191 : Did you think you could hide from me?
8192 : Hmph. Dogs have keen noses, don't they?
8193 : I've seen you somewhere before...
8194 : Oh, yes. You were fine company.
8195 : Imutira...fraternizing with the Empire? You have fallen far...
8196 : You're too kind, Qultada. I've simply wised up.
8197 : Let's get back on subject, shall we? I understand you're just dying to get your hands on this % here...
8198 : You must really be missing the feel of the ocean breeze on your face...and you need this to have it all back, don't you?
8199 : I have had enough of your prattle. Cut to the point.
8200 : My, my. What terrible manners.
8201 : Have it your way. Listen up, now. In exchange for the %, I require...
8202 : Your life.
8203 : I have not told you yet how the Black Cradle was destroyed...
8204 : At present, the Seagull Phratrie's base is located on land...but long ago, we roamed the seas, waging war on the Empire's merchant vessels.
8205 : Just like the corsairs of old...
8206 : However, one day we were cursed with ill fate, and came upon the Imperial Navy. Their warships relentlessly pursued us.
8207 : Finally, we were able to lose them after dark...
8208 : That's when we noticed that our lookout, Jahqib, had disappeared from his place atop the mast.
8209 : Everyone loved Jahqib...so we searched the ship for him desperately, but to no avail... He was gone.
8210 : It may be harsh, but during a naval battle, falling from a ship means death. There was nothing we could do.
8211 : Our ship had taken serious damage, and we were forced to retreat to the reefs. But fortune did not smile upon us that day... We would never be able to return in search of Jahqib.
8212 : We gave Imutira's brother a burial at sea with an empty casket... It was then that she started saying she wanted to join the Seagull Phratrie in order to avenge her brother's death.
8213 : In truth, however, her rage was not directed at the Empire, but at us...the Phratrie.
8214 : She believed that we'd realized he had fallen, leaving him to a watery fate in order to save ourselves.
8215 : Nobody ever discussed the matter...
8216 : The Phratrie members were beside themselves with sorrow and regret for the inability to protect their companion...
8217 : We couldn't bring ourselves to make an excuse for such a tragedy...
8218 : Even so, Imutira worked as a member of the Phratrie for a while...
8219 : And then...after returning from a mission to scout the Empire, she made an attempt on Qultada's life.
8220 : Of course, she was no match for Qultada, and her effort was a complete failure. Still...
8221 : The Seagull Phratrie has a rule...
8222 : If anyone attempts to take a crewmate's life, their life and right to sail will be forfeit.
8223 : However, Imutira was new, and the sister of a trusted member... Qultada had pity on her and gave her an option.
8224 : She could lose her life by the captain's sword, or get off the boat immediately.
8225 : Qultada knew how close the Imperial capital was, and that she could swim the distance with any luck.
8226 : You were trying to show me compassion, were you!? I thought the corsairs were known for their cunning, but you are a complete fool!
8227 : Fate truly is cruel... Imutira ended up joining her brother at his resting place in the raging seas. Or so we thought...
8228 : In exchange for my life? A suitable trade.
8229 : The Seagull Phratrie will lose you, but will gain the ability to sail the seas freely once again.
8230 : If you think about the long-term results, it's a pretty good deal.
8231 : Is this really what you want?
8232 : Yes!
8233 : I survived! Even the seas that took my brother from me could not take my life.
8234 : Do I have you to thank? Or the luck of the corsair?
8235 : No! I reached the bank using my own strength!
8236 : Qultada... From now on, I'll be able to walk the streets of Al Zahbi again...after I deliver your head to the Empire!
8237 : ...
8238 : What's the matter? Something frighten you? Heh heh.
8239 : Imutira... I was sure she had left this mortal coil...
8240 : Could it be...the luck of the corsair?
8241 : Qultada still regrets not being able to save Jahqib...
8242 : That fool thinks he can carry the entire world on his shoulders. He only has himself to thank for this.
8243 : The time has come... Give yourself over!
8244 : Sorry, but I refuse.
8245 : You what!?
8246 : All the same...
8247 : You will hear no complaint from me. If you really want my life, then come and get it.
8248 : Imutira, you were once one of us. But if you insist on playing this game, then allow me the honor of witnessing your skill.
8249 : Have it your way.
8250 : Good work, Imutira. I never dreamed things would go this smoothly. My trip out here was worth it after all.
8251 : Your words are too kind, Lord Yazquhl.
8252 : Now that we've got the Seagull's head, the rest of it is bound to show up in time. We should be able to dispose of all of them, then.
8253 : The scourge of the Near Eastern seas will no longer be a threat.
8254 : The Empress will be most pleased.
8255 : You will be executed as soon as we reach the capital.
8256 : That will give a message to the fools who scheme against the Empire. Nobody will stand against us now!
8257 : Your orders, Lady Zweeha?
8258 : Hmph... This is not the first time the captain's reckless behavior has caused me a headache.
8259 : Should we negotiate with the Immortals?
8260 : It would be a futile effort, and I am certain that Qultada would not appreciate it.
8261 : He would say that backing down would dishonor us in the sight of the original corsairs.
8262 : Then what do you suggest?
8263 : There is no need for worry. I have a plan.
8264 : It is time for a dance with bitter destiny.
8265 : %, you will have a part as well.
8266 : You cannot go looking like that, though...
8267 : Here. Wear this.
8268 : Not many members of the Seagull Phratrie have earned the right to wear this, but I think that you are ready now. I hope you find it useful.
8269 : Listen up, Phratrie! We must formulate a plan to save our captain. Everyone, prepare for battle!
8270 : Wait, %. I have separate orders for you. You are to infiltrate the Imperial capital and gather information first.
8271 : Then let us meet at the Shararat Teahouse.
8272 : Looks like the big, tough captain is all bark and no bite, eh?
8273 : ...
8274 : The orobon are going to enjoy such easy prey.
8275 : Do you think his crew will show up?
8276 : They'll be here, no doubt about that. The corsairs will do anything if they feel it's their duty... It's about the only thing they really care about.
8277 : It'll just make it all the easier to net them all at once and cast them into the sea where they belong.
8278 : Such naivety.
8279 : What do you know?
8280 : I have told you before... You underestimate my crew.
8281 : Impudence. How should I remember all of your foolish remarks?
8282 : You think it's funny, eh? You should be praying for a miracle...
8283 : Or do you think you can overpower us unarmed?
8284 : A corsair needs no sword or gun.
8285 : Luck is our weapon.
8286 : I would laugh on the steps to the guillotine. That's the way of the corsair.
8287 : This is madness.
8288 : I will finish this now.
8289 : Go ahead.
8290 : You're late!
8291 : Nice spot you've managed to get yourself into.
8292 : No need to fight over me, ladies.
8293 : Is that bandana wrapped around your head too tight?
8294 : You've got a lot of nerve to insinuate...
8295 : Stay right where you are, hound, unless you desire to meet your fate.
8296 : Don't think that you will escape us today... I've planned ahead.
8297 : Today the Seagull Phratrie will join their ancestors in their watery grave.
8298 : The Empire of Aht Urhgan triumphs once again!
8299 : Time for your last words, Qultada.
8300 : You too, Imutira.
8301 : Good work. Your job is over. You can...rest now.
8302 : What is the meaning of this!?
8303 : Did you really think the Empire would let a former corsair just walk away without punishment?
8304 : Then again... If you want to become like that Galka, go right ahead.
8305 : ...Cor...sairs... Die.... Kill...
8306 : ...There she goes.
8307 : Again...
8308 : What should we do?
8309 : Hmmm...
8310 : I suppose we should save her.
8311 : Ah, now that you mention it, she still has the %, doesn't she?
8312 : You should be worrying about yourselves now, corsairs!
8313 : Fine.
8314 : %, everything else is in your hands!
8315 : Hmph, my favorite clothes are completely soaked now, and it's all your fault.
8316 : End it already...
8317 : ...
8318 : Why did you have to save me? Why don't you end my life already!?
8319 : I'm so sick and tired of running...
8320 : No matter where I run to, I'll be a wanted person for the rest of my life...
8321 : And on top of that, I lost the closest person in the world to me...
8322 : To you corsairs...
8323 : My brother...
8324 : I did not take up this weapon so I could kill people.
8325 : Did you not see it in your brother?
8326 : Corsairs know what is at stake the moment they set foot on board.
8327 : There is no glory or honor in this battle, and it will rage on until you have gained or lost all you have ever desired.
8328 : Yet I have faith that even without our king, you shall achieve honor through your companions. Even should you end up in an early grave, your friends will pass on the tales of your glory until time's end.
8329 : If you want to end your life so badly, I am sure you can accomplish that on your own.
8330 : We are corsairs.
8331 : We believe in our companions...
8332 : And we will continue to navigate the seas until they turn to dry land.
8333 : ...!
8334 : Jahqib!
8335 : I wanted so badly to avenge your death...
8336 : ...
8337 : But now I believe I know why you decided to become a corsair...
8338 : You always looked so happy...
8339 : Qultada, when I turned against you and fell into the sea...
8340 : I thought I would never forgive you or the waves that took my brother from me.
8341 : I really believed that, but now...
8342 : Now, I'm not so sure...
8343 : The sound of the ocean and the scent of the sea breeze...
8344 : I don't think I can ever let them go.
8345 : This is disgusting... Why does the captain always have to act like this in front of women?
8346 : Tell me about it...
8347 : I have never met such a great fool in all my life...
8348 : Heheh... So %'s finally going to become an official member of our crew now...
8349 : Be quiet. The ceremony is about to begin.
8350 : %... Do you pledge to stand firm through any storm and to reach for the skies...
8351 : To never betray your companions no matter the reason, and to be loyal to your crew for all eternity?
8352 : Take the pledge? I swear. What was that last part?
8353 : Goddess of the Cyan Deep...
8354 : Today we welcome a valiant corsair to our ranks!
8355 : %, keep the pledge always in your heart...
8356 : And together we shall travel beyond the horizon...
8357 : Greetings.
8358 : I am afraid the crew is out at the moment.
8359 : Actually, %... I have a top secret mission for you.
8360 : You do not need to know any details, only what is required of you--%.
8361 : Find one, and bring it to me.
8362 : I will be waiting.
8363 : %... Excellent work, %.
8364 : You know what this means, do you not?
8365 : From this point forward, you are to leave mercy and hesitation at the door.
8366 : Forget for the moment that I am your captain.
8367 : I will be waiting at Talacca Cove.
8368 : When you arrive, use this % to enter the battlefield.
8369 : Understood? See you there.
8370 : Your % is torn...
8371 : You must bring %.
8372 : Wait! You told me different!
8373 : You are a fool.
8374 : But you promised! You said you would let me board the ship!
8375 : And you fell for it. Ha ha.
8376 : It's about time you realized you've been had.
8377 : You can't mean that!
8378 : No time for this. Thanks for the %.
8379 : You can't do this! Wait!
8380 : Bastard...
8381 : Hey, you! Don't just stand there! Give me a hand, will ya?
8382 : Fine! If you help me out, I'll give the % back to you!
8383 : You feel a chill run down your spine!
8384 : <Sigh>...
8385 : I can't believe this could happen to me...
8386 : Fooled by an imp? I was too careless...
8387 : Eh? You wanna know why I was dealing with an imp?
8388 : Well, I guess you did help me out. Don't tell anybody, okay?
8389 : I wanted to cross the ocean to the eastern capital.
8390 : There are two capitals of Aht Urhgan...one in the east, and one in the west. Did you know that?
8391 : Beastmen don't attack the eastern capital like they do Al Zahbi. It's a pretty safe place.
8392 : Now you're wondering why I want to go there?
8393 : Well... To tell the truth, I...
8394 : ...I'm going to have a child.
8395 : I want to raise my child in a safe place. Any mother would want the same, right?
8396 : But the route from Whitegate to the east is blocked by the high walls of the royal palace, and not so much as a chigoe could get through...
8397 : The only way to get there is by sea...
8398 : I was desperate to find a way when that imp approached me with his offer.
8399 : He said he could smuggle me to the east in exchange for %.
8400 : I was a fool to fall for it...
8401 : But you saved me.
8402 : I've realized that what you really need to get by in this world are...
8403 : Money!
8404 : Luck!
8405 : And strength!
8406 : I'm going to work hard from now on and become strong like the corsairs. ...And I can already best anyone in a game of dice!
8407 : So where am I going to go?
8408 : We can decide that with a roll of the dice! This time, no cheating.
8409 : Yadhiwa readies Dice Roll.
8410 : Yadhiwa rolls a 777!
8411 : Hoho... Guess I'll try my luck in the west, then.
8412 : Anyway, I promised to give this back to you. It's all yours.
8413 : So long!
8414 : There is a pile of discarded materials here.
8415 : You see an old, dented automaton...
8416 : There is nothing else of interest here.
8417 : Yes? What do you require?
8418 : You are currently at the Ilrusi Atoll staging point. This is Imperial territory, and trespassing is strictly forbidden.
8419 : Yes? What do you require?
8420 : You wish to tell me something, yes? What is it?
8421 : Show her the %? Yes. I have nothing to say.
8422 : You show the % to the Immortal.
8423 : A light gleams in Meyaada's eyes!
8424 : %? For me?
8425 : This scent is heavenly...
8426 : Thank you.
8427 : Oh, yes...
8428 : I can give you some valuable information.
8429 : Behind you lies a gleaming blue device.
8430 : It is called a runic portal.
8431 : Runic portals were developed by the Aht Urhgan alchemists utilizing state-of-the-art technology.
8432 : I am sure that you will find them most useful.
8433 : You can use a runic portal to transport yourself to Al Zahbi in a moment's time.
8434 : After going to Al Zahbi once using the portal, you can freely travel back and forth between the Imperial capital and here.
8435 : I am sure you will find many an occasion to use it.
8436 : Then please withdraw immediately.
8437 : Remember to use the runic portal if you need quick travel to the Ilrusi Atoll staging point here.
8438 : %'s mercenary badge flashes.
8439 : The mark of the wildcat? You must be a mercenary from Salaheem's Sentinels.
8440 : We are both working for the good of the Empire. I wish you luck.
8441 : You hand over the % to the Immortal.
8442 : Your Imperial Standing has increased!
8443 : off.
8444 : Lamia's defense mode on!
8446 : Nothing happens...
8447 : You must move closer to the target.
8448 : The suggested level for % is #. Place a level restriction on the party?
8449 : Place a level restriction? No. Level 70. Level 60. Level 50.
8450 : Your party's level will be [unrestricted/restricted to 70/restricted to 60/restricted to 50] for %.

8475 : You are unable to participate because one or more of your party members has not achieved master status in his job.
8476 : Which mission will you attempt? None. %.
8477 : # Which objective will you attempt? None. %. The Black Coffin. Against All Odds. Scouting the Ashu Talif. Royal Painter Escort. Targeting the Captain. Peach Power.
8478 : Greetings, mercenary. I am  of the Immortals.
8479 : You are here on an Assault mission? Then you'll be wanting command verification.
8480 : Do you want command verification? Yes. No. Command what...?
8481 : If you have # [credit/credits] available from your Imperial Standing, I will recognize your ability to lead this Assault mission.
8482 : Receive command verification? Yes. (# [credit/credits]) No.
8483 : Very well. Consider your command of this mission verified.
8484 : With this in your possession, you will be able to pass through the runic seal and enter the Assault area. Good luck.
8485 : I cannot entrust leadership of a mission to a mercenary with such an unimpressive standing. Return to me when you are worthy.
8486 : You refuse to assume leadership? Perhaps you should make that decision before you speak to me.
8487 : No? Then I suggest you complete your preparations and await your leader's orders!
8488 : Receiving command verification will authorize you to begin an Assault mission.
8489 : Naturally, you are also charged with the responsibility of making sure your party members are ready to enter the Assault area.
8490 : However, successfully completing an Assault mission under your command will most certainly improve your standing with the Empire.
8491 : The Mamool Ja Savages are on the move. Intercept their forces in the Wajaom Woodlands!
8492 : The Troll Mercenaries are on the move. Intercept their forces in the Wajaom Woodlands!

8495 : The Troll Mercenaries have breached the Balrahn Defense Line! Intercept their forces in Al Zahbi's Bastion!
8496 : The Undead Swarm has breached the Balrahn Defense Line! Intercept their forces in Al Zahbi's Bastion!
8497 : Al Zahbi is Besieged! Defend the Astral Candescence!
8498 : Al Zahbi is no longer Besieged.
8499 : The beastmen have retreated.
8500 : The Mamool Ja Savages have retreated.
8501 : The Troll Mercenaries have retreated.
8502 : The Undead Swarm has retreated.
8503 : Al Zahbi has recovered the Astral Candescence.
8504 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The beastmen have taken the Astral Candescence.

8507 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The Undead Swarm has taken the Astral Candescence.
8508 : The Mark of Zahak. It appears that you and I walk the same path...
8509 : No words are necessary. There is only the duty that I must perform.
8510 : You live... We are done here. Be on your way.
8511 : A harsh road lies before you. Lamenting your choice will not bring back what you have lost. Do your duty.
8512 : Mwahahahaha...
8513 : Mwahaha... I am Fhu Madihmin...
8514 : Mwahahahaha...
8515 : I don't get many visitors here on the edge of the reef...
8516 : Bwahahahaha...
8517 : What could you be looking for?
8518 : Mwahaha...
8519 : You don't have to answer me.
8520 : I know what you seek...
8521 : That % you clutch in your flesh-and-blood hand...
8522 : ...mwahaha...
8523 : ...will be your fare to board the Coffin...
8524 : My cutter will take you to the...Coffin. Oh, most definitely...
8525 : Through the mists, I will be your guide... A humble, forgotten ferrywoman...
8526 : Time...flows on and around us...
8527 : Your % will be mine, one way or another...
8528 : Bwahaha... Does your courage fail you?
8529 : Do you wish to return the way you came? Time to leave. I am not afraid.
8530 : You are honest...
8531 : Your % is mine...
8532 : The % is gone!
8533 : The fare is paid...
8534 : Farewell...
8535 : Admiral, an Imperial dog has boarded our ship...
8536 : Kill [him/her].
8537 : %! This place will be your death. We must retreat!
8538 : They finally show their forms...
8539 : I had concealed my presence, but sensed a chill in the air.
8540 : Then I noticed you on the deck, with some rather unfriendly company.
8541 : I must admit to my surprise.
8542 : But it is good to see another Sentinel who shares my instincts.
8543 : The being that gave the orders...
8544 : His supernatural aura was palpable.
8545 : We can assume he is the captain of the ship.
8546 : If we can but uncover the true identity of that apparition, the secrets of the ghost ship will be ours.
8547 : Fortunately, I have another % for me, and one for you.
8548 : When you are prepared, let us return to the Ashu Talif, blades bared!
8549 : The % you carried...
8551 : Press a button to continue.
8552 : Fragments of bone, claws, and teeth are scattered around the gate...
8553 : The % shatters... The % shatters... The % shatters...
8554 : You can feel a strong magical power emanating from the center of the gate. It seems powerful enough to transport you to a distant place.
8555 : Give in to the magical power? It's worth a shot. You must be joking!
8556 : The orobon is trembling with anger.
8557 : The orobon is seething with fury.
8558 : The orobon is completely livid with rage!
8559 : The orobon returns to its senses!
8560 : The orobon's anger begins to subside!
8561 : The orobon has forgotten why it became angry.
8562 : The orobon is calm again!
8563 : The orobon seems tranquil for a brief moment.
8564 : The orobon seems to be feeling better.
8565 : The orobon's anger subsides.
8566 : There is a small water puddle here. % splashes the orobon with water!
8567 : The orobon is still angry.
8568 : Now is not the time for that!
8569 : You cannot obtain the %. Come back again after sorting your inventory.
8570 : #...
8571 : Foolish two-legs... Have you forgotten the terrible power of the gorgons you created? It is time you were reminded...
8572 : No... I cannot leave my sisters...
8573 : You do not possess %.
8574 : You feel an eerie sense of foreboding...
8575 : Sailing, sailing without a care!
8576 : This ship can take us anywhere!
8577 : Da-dum pa-rum pa-rum! Tra-la, la-la-la!
8578 : You two...
8579 : ...need to calm down.
8580 : Mnejing!
8581 : What is it?
8582 : You should really try to enjoy yourself!
8583 : So much fun!
8584 : So exciting!
8585 : Don't you think you should keep it down?
8586 : Mnejing, you stick-in-the-mud. Suppressing one's joy isn't healthy!
8587 : She's right, Mnejing.
8588 : Just look at us!
8589 : We're riding on a ghost ship!
8590 : Aphmau, can you see anything out there?
8591 : Hmm, let's take a look... Oh, Ovjang! Could that be...?
8592 : Walahra's Flames!
8593 : Look, there's another one!
8594 : Oho!
8595 : Fire on the water!
8596 : Aphmau...
8597 : Hmm?
8598 : It doesn't look like a weapon...
8599 : The city below is burning... I wonder where it could be?
8600 : Surely this isn't...Al Zahbi?
8601 : I'm sure it's just an artist's interpretation...
8602 : Yes, I suppose you're right...
8603 : What's wrong?
8604 : This huge castle thing looks like an iron giant...
8605 : And this knight holding the spear is flying in the air...
8606 : A giant and a knight...
8607 : A colossus and a rider...
8608 : Of course!
8609 : How could we be so blind? This is a picture of Alzadaal and the Dark Rider!
8610 : Then this scene is...!
8611 : Yes...
8612 : The Age of Judgment.
8613 : You know the subject of this painting? I must admit to some surprise.
8614 : Admiral Luzaf!
8615 : Heh...
8616 : Be at ease. I'm not going to harm you.
8617 : ...
8618 : Just as you supposed, this painting depicts the Age of Judgment, as it occurred close to nine hundred years ago.
8619 : In the West, the beginning of the Crystal Era was marked the year the Gordeus exploded in a supernova...
8620 : ...and banished the very night.
8621 : Well, I knew that...
8622 : You are well educated, for a young lass.
8623 : Insolence!
8624 : You will address her as Lady Aphmau!
8625 : You control both puppets? Quite impressive for such a slip of a girl.
8626 : Nobody speaks to me in such a casual manner!
8627 : Has the salt air eroded your manners?
8628 : Ah, my apologies...
8629 : Apology accepted. Now what do you intend to do with us?
8630 : Do with you?
8631 : I don't recall forcing you and your little mistress to follow me...
8632 : ...
8633 : You and Lady Aphmau.
8634 : Then we should like to disembark immediately.
8636 : I am sorry, but that will not be possible.
8637 : My business concerns your automaton companions.
8638 : And now that I know you are the key to controlling them...my business concerns you as well.
8639 : Fine by me! We never intended to return to the palace in any case!
8640 : ! The palace...?
8641 : Ovjang! Shhh!
8642 : It is of no import. I will instruct my crew to allow you free reign of the ship.
8643 : Wait!
8644 : What are you after? Why did you take Ovjang away from me?
8645 : What is this all about?
8646 : What is this...all about?
8647 : You will learn soon enough.
8648 : Aht Urhgan--the entire world and all its people, in fact--
8649 : ...will soon learn.
8650 : You're late, %. The mission was a failure.
8651 : Rishfee...
8652 : ...was slain.
8653 : We were recruits together. Ever since the Immortals took me in as a child, we've always been close...
8654 : But he was too kindhearted to walk the path of the blue mage.
8655 : He wouldn't have lasted long in any case...
8656 : Don't blame yourself for the inevitable.
8657 : The inevitable...
8658 : Your instincts were right in coming to the Arrapago Islands.
8659 : But this stretch of water is dotted with hundreds of islands, large and small, and the terrain is complex.
8660 : A straightforward search isn't practical.
8661 : We have soldiers scouring both the land and the sea, but the Ashu Talif has a swift sail.
8662 : She won't be caught so easily...
8663 : We require your further cooperation.
8664 : In my function as an Immortal, I officially entrust you with a new mission:
8665 : You are to travel immediately to Periqia, and carry out a search for Lady Aphmau.
8666 : This is a %. You will need it to enter the secured area of Periqia.
8667 : Try not to lose it.
8668 : If, by any chance, you happen to misplace the permit, speak with Nahshib at the Dvucca Isle staging point.
8669 : You have your orders. Track down Lady Aphmau to clear this stain on your record...
8670 : ...and honor Rishfee's sacrifice.
8671 : You have returned to this haunted place... Such bravery.
8672 : But you do not possess %...
8673 : Without the fare, I will not put my cutter out to sea...do you see?
8674 : You have returned to this haunted place... Such bravery.
8675 : You seek to make another foray into the Coffin, black and foreboding...?
8676 : Do you wish passage to the Black Coffin? I do. Not at this time.
8677 : The % you hold will pay your fare...
8678 : My cutter will bear you to the...coffin...you seek...
8679 : What are you gonna do with her, Boss?
8680 : ...
8681 : His Maleficence awaits. Off the girl, and let's get on with the ceremony in Hazhalm.
8682 : We are done, Admiral!
8683 : Tired of cleaning already? That's what you get for sending a snob to do a swab's job...
8684 : You do us a disservice, Mister Flit. The deck is swept and scrubbed!
8685 : Aphmau was only supervising, though...
8686 : Ovjang! Shhh!
8687 : Well, then. For your next chore...
8688 : Enough, Flit!
8689 : I must speak with our guests in private.
8690 : Oho! The Admiral desires our exclusive company!
8691 : B-but, we weren't done talk--
8692 : Flit. Do not make me repeat myself.
8693 : Aye aye, Cap'n. You're the boss.
8694 : How...how are you feeling?
8695 : Much recovered.
8696 : I was told you stayed at my bedside throughout the night.
8697 : I am grateful.
8698 : It was nothing...
8699 : But now...now that you know...
8700 : That you are the Empress?
8701 : Yes.
8702 : In the past, you would already lie slain at my feet.
8703 : !!!
8704 : Do not be concerned.
8705 : Such a petty act of vengeance no longer stirs my heart.
8706 : Luzaf...
8707 : I was once the Crown Prince of Ephramad.
8708 : My kingdom was destroyed by the Empire of Aht Urhgan while I studied in distant lands...
8709 : I would not yield to the Imperial conquerors, and forged the remnants of the Ephramadian navy into a rebel force--the corsairs.
8710 : Our battles with the Empire raged day after day after day...
8711 : And then during the course of a single night, the entire corsair fleet was annihilated at the hands of Lamiae as the ships slept in port--Lamiae under the control of the Imperial Army.
8712 : The Black Coffin--the only ship to escape the slaughter--was ambushed by Imperial war galleys and sent to the ocean floor...
8713 : That is the story of my death...
8714 : Just a moment.
8715 : Then you really are...dead? A ghost?
8716 : A ghost... I suppose that I am.
8717 : But, you appear as a living being. Solid to the touch...
8718 : I don't think you could call this existence living.
8719 : What do you mean?
8720 : Even now, I am irrevocably chained to the underworld.
8721 : Does this have something to do with that shadow in Periqia?
8722 : The shadow? Yes, that form will be my fate. As ordained by Odin, my immortal lord...
8723 : The form of the Dark Rider...?
8724 : You miss little, I see.
8725 : As the violent throes of the battered Black Coffin threw me over the side and I sank into the dark, cold waters of oblivion, I made a plea to the dark god...
8726 : Great Odin, guardian of the Kingdom of Ephramad, I beseech thee...
8727 : If it is but one swing of my blade, grant me the chance for revenge.
8728 : It was then that Odin appeared before me.
8729 : !!!
8730 : He spoke to me thus: When the Age of Judgment draws near, I shall grant thy wish...
8731 : But once thy revenge is complete, thou shalt destroy mine enemy...Alexander.
8732 : Alexander...
8733 : The legendary savior who will be reborn in the body of the iron giant in the hour of the Empire's greatest need...
8734 : I am aware of the legend. It is the reason I forged this pact--the chance for revenge against the Empire. The desire consumed my very being...
8735 : The next time I awoke, I found myself upon the deck of the Black Coffin, afloat at sea.
8736 : It was as if I had merely slept, albeit for long years...
8737 : Two hundred years...isn't that right?
8738 : Yes.
8739 : To prepare for my war against the Empire, I joined forces with the beastmen.
8740 : I then searched for the automatons--the keys to manipulating the iron giant.
8741 : But I eventually realized, or should I say, was made to realize:
8742 : My seething wrath was for the emperor that destroyed my kingdom...
8743 : ...and the empire he ruled during my living years.
8744 : That empire no longer exists. And you, Aphmau, are not the one against whom I seek revenge.
8745 : Am I not pitiful? A vengeful shade that has lost his taste for vengeance...
8746 : You are pitiful...
8747 : What!?
8748 : You still have the chance to rebuild the Kingdom of Ephramad!
8749 : But I...
8750 : I learned a lot living in the temple.
8751 : The descendants of Ephramad still yearn for the age when their kingdom yet flourished...
8752 : There are those who still fight for such a reality.
8753 : You can help them find the path to the kingdom of their dreams.
8754 : The people of Ephramad...survived...
8755 : But this path you speak of, will it not lead to conflict and bloodshed with the Empire, plunging all once again into the flames of war?
8756 : Admiral. Prince Luzaf. Have you forgotten with whom you speak?
8758 : Leave the Empire to us!
8759 : Heh.
8760 : Hahaha. You are right.  And I am still a corsair. I will take a gamble on this fool's venture.
8761 : That's the spirit! You must undo this pact with Odin as soon as possible...
8762 : Yes...I must seek audience with my dark lord.
8763 : Please, Boss. The tears won't stop.
8764 : Flit...
8765 : Giving up on the revenge business is your call.
8766 : But your crew has been restored, and your ship raised from the ocean floor.
8767 : The pact must be honored.
8768 : Your path lies in one direction only:
8769 : To Hazhalm, and an existence as the new Dark Rider, incarnation of the Great Odin.
8770 : If you renege on the deal, you know what awaits you and your crew, right?
8771 : ...
8772 : Hazhalm? What is he talking about?
8773 : Hee hee, hee hee.
8774 : What a tragedy. A real shame, it is. The poor little Empress floundering in the dark.
8775 : You spent so much energy playing the part of a puppetmaster, you never noticed the Grand Vizier pulling your strings.
8776 : How dare you!
8777 : Enough, Flit.
8778 : Went a little bit far there, didn't I? How about I make it up by teaching you about Hazhalm?
8779 : It was the site for alchemical experiments that pushed the limits of reason.
8780 : The reckless fools eventually ripped the very fabric of reality, and opened a door into Odin's domain--without even knocking, I might add.
8781 : Of course, we've been using that tear as a shortcut into this world.
8782 : Hee hee, hee hee!
8783 : You have made your point. Let us proceed to Hazhalm.
8784 : Yes! Proceed! No other choice, really.
8785 : Are you serious about this, Admiral?
8786 : I will present myself before Odin, and nullify the pact.
8787 : Yes! Nullify! No other choi...
8788 : Hold on, hold on! What's this talk about nullifying!?
8789 : Are you sure, Luzaf?
8790 : I am sure. Fate's grip is strong, but we are the masters of our own destiny.
8791 : You taught me that.
8792 : Me?
8793 : When I look at you...
8794 : ...I feel as I did in my younger days. I remember what it is to hope.
8795 : There were so many things I didn't know back then, so many things I wanted to learn.
8796 : Aphmau. You are searching for a way to save your Empire...
8797 : A way to save your citizens from despair and misery.
8798 : To do that you seek to uncover the truth behind the world in which you live.
8799 : I do...but...
8800 : Aphmau... Nashmeira.
8801 : !?
8802 : You must come with me! Come to Hazhalm!
8803 : Then you shall behold the truth with your own eyes.
8804 : I...I will go with you.
8805 : (Hee hee, hee hee.)
8806 : (There are some things in this world better left unknown...)
8807 : Admiral.
8808 : What is it?
8809 : The ship appears to have picked up another rat...
8810 : %!
8811 : You know this intruder?
8812 : That [man/woman] is my private mercenary! Please stay your blades!
8813 : But, why...?
8814 : Why are you here?
8815 : Why did you board the Black Coffin? To find you. To find Luzaf.
8816 : Oh, %. You really are my mercenary!
8817 : To what end??
8818 : Oh, %... You shouldn't jest.
8819 : Your linkpearl should have been confiscated... Did you call this mercenary?
8820 : Huh? Uh...right, yes. I called [him/her] in to act as my bodyguard!
8821 : Isn't that right, Mnejing?
8822 : R-right. The old message-in-a-bottle trick...
8823 : (Where do all these meddlers come from...?)
8824 : You expect me to swallow that story?
8825 : Ahem! But this works out perfectly, Boss.
8826 : You need help if you mean to rebuild your kingdom.
8827 : The Ephramadian treasure you recovered from the Empire is still stashed in Talacca Cove.
8828 : And there have been all those Immortals sniffing about lately...
8829 : Immortals?
8830 : It matters not--the treasure is veiled by a powerful spell of concealment.
8831 : The only way to pierce the illusion is with %. And you and I possess the only two in existence.
8832 : Right, right, it's a great spell. Fantastic. But who knows what those Immortals are capable of?
8833 : There's no guarantee they haven't sucked up some crazy sensory ability from some hapless creature.
8834 : That's why we need %.
8835 : And Talacca Cove just happens to be on the way to Hazhalm.
8836 : If you give your % to %, [he/she] can work security on the treasure.
8837 : This is Aphmau's loyal mercenary we're talking about here.
8838 : We can trust [him/her] not to swipe the goods, and to lead those blue devils off the scent if they get too close.
8839 : But I need % by my side...
8840 : Well, I can't argue with that.
8841 : If [he/she] stays on the ship, we'll just have to submit [him/her] to a thorough investigation. Just to be on the safe side, you understand.
8842 : Wouldn't you agree, First Mate Salabwahn?
8843 : I...uh...
8844 : (Just play along!)
8845 : Why, yes! We have the utmost faith in %.
8846 : [He/She] is the perfect choice to keep your precious treasure safe and sound.
8847 : Very well. I shall abide by your judgment.
8848 : Take this, %.
8849 : Luzaf hands % %!
8850 : Keep watch over the treasure until we return to Talacca Cove.
8851 : But if you sense you are needed, be ready to fly to our side with all haste.
8852 : Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
8853 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
8854 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
8855 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
8856 : You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
8857 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
8858 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
8859 : Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
8860 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
8861 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
8862 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
8863 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
8864 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
8865 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
8866 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
8867 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
8868 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
8869 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
8870 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
8871 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
8872 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
8873 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
8874 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
8875 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
8876 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
8877 : You can only carry one %.
8878 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
8879 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
8880 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
8881 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
8882 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
8883 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
8884 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
8885 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
8886 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
8887 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
8888 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
8889 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
8890 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
8891 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...

8977 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
8978 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
8979 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
8980 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
8981 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
8982 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
8983 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
8984 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
8985 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
8986 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
8987 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
8988 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
8989 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
8990 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
8991 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
8992 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
8993 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
8994 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
8995 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
8996 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
8997 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
8998 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
8999 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
9000 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
9001 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
9002 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
9003 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
9004 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
9005 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
9006 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
9007 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
9008 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
9009 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
9010 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
9011 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
9012 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
9013 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
9014 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
9015 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
9016 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
9017 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
9018 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%

9851 : What's this? 'Twould appear that thy weapon can endure no further enchantments.
9852 : Though it may fall short of thy expectations, pray accept it.
9853 : Otherwise, we shall have no choice but to dispose of it.
9854 : Many thanks for thine assistance!
9855 : Pray accept this % as but a humble token of our gratitude.
9859 : Who might you be? I should probably warn you about this place.
9860 : Hm? %? Your timing is impeccable.
9861 : Ah, you're a mercenary? In that case, you might just prove useful.
9862 : Silence! You wouldn't understand, Aznahf!
9863 : Okay now, let's try to remain calm.
9864 : Follow me. There is a certain matter that we need your help with.
9865 : Well, it can't be helped now. What's done is done.
9866 : Hey, that's the kind of attitude that's got Mutihb so upset in the first place.
9867 : Well, if something is impossible, then it's impossible--end of story.
9868 : That ship was just as important to us as our beloved Black Cradle! Do you even care!?
9869 : H-hey, let's not get carried away now...
9870 : Not you too, Uki...
9871 : That's enough, everyone.
9872 : We have a guest.
9873 : As corsairs, we have certain appearances to maintain when in the presence of others.
9874 : Y-yes, of course...
9875 : I'm sorry, Captain.
9876 : Yeah, I'm sorry too.
9877 : Well, not so much a guest really. You remember %.
9878 : I was thinking [she/he] could help with the rather impossible task that Mutihb gave Aznahf.
9879 : I have brought a rather capable mercenary with me.
9880 : I figured there would be no better person to ask for help with the rather impossible task that Mutihb gave Aznahf.
9881 : You mean [he/she]'ll deal with that pteraketos for me!?
9882 : Will you slay the pteraketos? Sure, no problem. Sorry, not interested.
9883 : First of all, you need to calm down--both you and Mutihb.
9884 : Yes, you should probably explain the situation to our friend here.
9885 : Yes, of course... Allow us to introduce ourselves.
9886 : We belong to a group of corsairs known as the Seagull Phratrie. We come from a long line of proud pirates.
9887 : Unfortunately, our beloved ship known as the Black Cradle was badly damaged in a recent skirmish.
9888 : We've been doing all we can to try and repair it.
9889 : Good point. You know our ship the Black Cradle, right?
9890 : It was damaged recently and we've been doing all we can to try and repair it.
9891 : To help fund the repairs, Mutihb won us a small ship in a little game of chance.
9892 : Yeah, I was absolutely on fire with those dice!
9893 : We used that ship to double the Seagull Phratrie's earnings. Everything was going swimmingly, until...
9894 : Ahem. Basically, Aznahf here went and sank the ship.
9895 : Sheesh! It's not like I did it on purpose or anything!
9896 : How was I supposed to know there'd be a pteraketos lurking in such shallow water!?
9897 : I find that pretty hard to believe. Besides, if there really was a pteraketos there, I told you to kill it for us.
9898 : Its % would surely fetch a high price on the open market.
9899 : I could've then used that money to raise some more capital and buy us a new ship...
9900 : Well, that would depend on your luck with the dice, of course.
9901 : I'm telling you the truth! There really was a pteraketos...
9902 : When it attacked and I was thrown into the ocean, I thought I was done for! Actually, it's a miracle I'm even still alive!
9903 : Please, you've gotta avenge me! Take down that pteraketos!
9904 : So, as you can see, %... We have a little request for you.
9905 : So, as you can see... We have a little request for you.
9906 : According to Aznahf, the pteraketos was attempting to come ashore near the pier in the northwest section of the Arrapago Reef.
9907 : We want you to investigate the area, and if there really is a pteraketos there, to hunt it down and bring us back our prize.
9908 : And if there's no sign of the pteraketos anywhere, examine the general surroundings. We'd at least like to know what sunk our ship.
9909 : Naturally, there's a reward in it for you too. We're counting on you, friend.
9910 : Investigate the pier in the northwest section of the Arrapago Reef.
9911 : Kupii.
9912 : Kah?
9913 : How will you respond? Who are you? What are you doing here? Have you seen a pteraketos nearby?
9914 : Kupii.
9915 : Kah.
9916 : Kah...
9917 : Kah, kah-kah-kah!
9918 : It appears to be hungry...
9919 : Kah...
9920 : In other words, we're sssupposed to let the humanoid that harmed our pteraketos off the hook!?
9921 : Ah, how unfortunate... I was looking forward to slowly tearing that two-legs apart, limb from limb...
9922 : Kah-puk, pyukah, pikkupi, kwo-kwo. Pteraketos, puka, kal-kal.
9923 : Um... Our focus should be on finding an aeropearl. It is vital for the sake of our pteraketos's mission.
9924 : Kwipak-kahpi, kal-kal, kupikku, kepak-kah-poh. Apu, pikku-pipi, kucha, kapuri-cho.
9925 : It is needed to reach the deepest trenches of the distant sea. We can punish the humanoid anytime.
9926 : Perhaps, but due to the two-legged one's ship, the aeropearl was shattered. We won't be satisfied until he has paid for his crime.
9927 : Yes, I agree. Do you know how hard we've worked, trying to find this object so that we may ensure continued peace throughout the seas?
9928 : We've spent decades scouring the sea floor, searching through the two-legged ones' ruins, and just when we finally locate it...
9929 : Keh-kukah, kah-rere, kwo-oh, kah-kwo... Puka, kubah, kwo-kwo, pikkupi, keh-pupi.
9930 : I understand your anger and sense of futility. However, our first order of business is to find another aeropearl.
9931 : Pii-pikupi. Kal-kal, kwo-kwo, pikkupi, poh-kupukkuru, kapuri-cho.
9932 : Time is of the essence. As such, we may need to seek the help of an outsider. ...Hm? An outsider?
9933 : Elder, do you mean that humanoid standing over there? Should I go and capture it for you?
9934 : What did you sssay!?
9935 : A humanoid!?
9936 : Get 'em!
9937 : Let's gut it and feast on its blood!
9938 : Keh-keh-kumi.
9939 : One or more of your party members do not meet the prerequisites for this battle.
9940 : One or more of your party members are not in the appropriate staging zone.
9941 : One or more of your party members are currently viewing a cutscene.
9942 : Kukahpi, kah-kah. Pikkukah, kucha, kah-puk. Kah-kah, kapuri-cho, kwoggpi.
9943 : Listen, everyone. Now is not the time to fight. Put away your weapons, all of you.
9944 : Kwo-kyoppi, kupikku.
9945 : Huh!? Y-yes, you're right! They're here!
9946 : I Gloom Phantom!
9947 : Magh Bihu!
9948 : Dazbog!
9949 : And our group is...
9950 : The Destiny Destroyers!
9951 : Yesss, I've heard of them before...
9952 : That sword...
9953 : They're adorable. And they look oh so delicious too...
9954 : Huh!? You're the one I met at Megomak's place!
9955 : Kah-puh, pah-pah, kapuri-cho. Kupi-kwo, kahpuh-pah-pah. Kapuri-cho, pipukuku, ku-rahrah.
9956 : Ah, so you know this person? In that case, I have a favor to ask.
9957 : I don't know if I'd go that far... We've crossed paths before, that's about it.
9958 : Who this person? I never seen [his/her] sullen face before.
9959 : M-Magh Bihu has been through a lot lately and tends to forget things...
9960 : Hey, you! You'd better do what you can to help the apkallu elder!
9961 : As you can see from his prickly appearance, he's not one to be messed with around here.
9962 : Kapuri-cho. Kwo-kwo, pikkupi, pi-kupu.
9963 : Humanoid, I need you to go and find the aeropearl.
9964 : Keh-keh, kah-pippu, kal-kal, kwo-kwo, puka-puka. Aaru, orekal-kal, kapuri-cho, kuare.
9965 : The beastmen of this land have looked far and wide, but have failed to find it. Therefore, I wish for you to search your world for us.
9966 : Hmm... I don't think I've ever heard of this aeropearl before.
9967 : They were sssupposedly created by a human named Ramuul that lived here long ago.
9968 : They are required when a new guardian for the pteraketos emergesss, so we were protecting them.
9969 : However, the battle known as Ragnarok ssspilled over into the oceans, causing many of them to be dessstroyed.
9970 : As such, the next guardian won't be able to reach the ocean trenches unless we can find a new one.
9971 : Ah, it's such a shame--the pteraketos in possession of the aeropearl getting hit by a humanoid ship...
9972 : I tell ya, those humanoids are always causing trouble at the most inopportune times!
9973 : The owner of that ship should pay with his life for such a crime!
9974 : Pitsu, kukahppu, kupi-kupahku?
9975 : Humanoid, do you know anything about this matter?
9976 : Do you know anything? Actually, I do. No, sorry.
9977 : What!? Was it your ship that destroyed the aeropearl!?
9978 : Did you destroy the aeropearl? No, it wasn't me.
9979 : So just what are you trying to say then? My head's starting to hurt...
9980 : Kupipi. Kupi-kwo, kwo-kwo, pikkupi, pipipi, gupii-guppi.
9981 : Humanoid, please take a message to the owner of the ship. We will forgive his crime if he finds us a new aeropearl.
9982 : Seriously!? That's rather generous of you!
9983 : Kupipi, pi-ku, kah-kah, kurah.
9984 : Furthermore, we will give him a treasure, the likes of which your kind has never seen before. Elder, are you sure about this?
9985 : Pi-pukuku, pikkupi.
9986 : Well, I guess the elder's got more faith in you than I do, that's for sure.
9987 : Sounds like elder is desperate enough to turn to [a hume/a hume/an Elvaan/an Elvaan/a Tarutaru/a Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka] for help. Or maybe he just lost his mind.
9988 : I-if the apkallu elder has lost his mind, then we're all in trouble...
9989 : L-let's tell him why the Destiny Destroyers are here and see how it goes.
9990 : Well, we're off to take care of some business. See ya around!
9991 : Kah.
9992 : The apkallu elder wants you to deliver a message to the Seagull Phratrie.
9993 : Hey, we've been waiting for you! Did you find the pteraketos?
9994 : Well, that's definitely not the news we were hoping to hear.
9995 : About what the apkallu elder said... I had thought it was only just a legend.
9996 : Huh? What legend is that?
9997 : It comes from the Kingdom of Ephramad. When the apkallu speaks, so does the ocean. If you don't listen, the kingdom is doomed.
9998 : Still, I never expected the likes of the Mamool Ja and Lamiae to be caught up in this matter too.
9999 : Wh-wh-what should we do?
10000 : I know you were mad about the ship being destroyed, but it looks like the pteraketos lost something equally important.
10001 : Well, it's not like we can do anything about that now!
10002 : If they find out that I was the one on that ship...
10003 : Or if they find out that I own the ship...
10004 : Yeah, I'd say the both of you are pretty much done for.
10005 : Okay now, let's stop scaring the lads, shall we?
10006 : %, these Mamool Ja with the fins and the Lamiae--they don't know about Mutihb or Aznahf, right?
10007 : Well, that's one less thing to worry about. Actually, this could be a good opportunity for us.
10008 : Huh? What do you mean, Captain?
10009 : If we can find one of these aeropearl things, we'll receive a magnificent treasure that no one's ever seen before!
10010 : If we play this right, we can repair the Black Cradle and forget about the other ship.
10011 : I get it! That's a great idea, Captain!
10012 : Well, I've never heard of these aeropearls before.
10013 : How about you guys?
10014 : In that case, we'll have to use every last pair of eyes, ears, hands, and feet that the Seagull Phratrie can muster in order to find the information we need.
10015 : Besides, if it comes from the bottom of the sea, then it's nothing that us corsairs can't find. We'll find it eventually.
10016 : Let's go, everyone!
10017 : Wait a minute, %.
10018 : I said that back there to help motivate Mutihb and Aznahf, who are understandably frightened.
10019 : However, it will be no easy task finding one of these aeropearls. That's what my dice are telling me anyway.
10020 : What kind of outcome do your dice foresee? Can you bring us the luck we need?
10021 : Are you feeling lucky? Definitely. Sorry, today's not my day.
10022 : I'm counting on you, for the sake of my crew.
10023 : Here, hopefully this can help change your luck. I'm counting on you, for the sake of my crew.
10024 : Anyway, I have a feeling Lady Luck is blowing a favorable wind your way. I'm counting on you, for the sake of my crew.
10025 : Even the apkallu elder himself recognizes the strength you possess.
10026 : It's unusual for one of our kind to receive such respect from a beastman. I have a feeling this could be fate at work...
10027 : Surely, if anyone can get more information from the beastmen, you can. Please, speak with the apkallu and see what you can find out!
10028 : It seems you need to pay the apkallu elder another visit...
10029 : Kupii?
10030 : What will you say? I need to see the elder.
10031 : Kah.
10032 : How many times do I have to say it? What happens when we can't find the aeropearl!?
10033 : The whole reason you summoned us here...
10034 : You know, about cracking open the World Eater Egg!
10035 : Popopi, kanpiri. Kwepi, gugu-pikucha, kei-osu.
10036 : Umm... W-we can't allow such a terrible thing to come to pass. Th-there are none who could defeat that beast.
10037 : What!? But if the pteraketos is unable to submerge with the egg, won't it float back up to the surface?
10038 : And if it does, it's likely to crack open eventually and you know what will happen then!
10039 : Besides, I heard the Olduum staff lost its power. That means there's nothing anyone can do about the matter.
10040 : So that's why I should just go ahead and crack it open myself!
10041 : Kurruku-pi. Kuputte, ore, gugupi.
10042 : U-uh... L-let us worry about that when the time comes. Wh-when this land is irrevocably doomed.
10043 : Dazbog, why you talk like humanoids? Everyone understand what elder say.
10044 : U-uh... Well, I... I'm not sure everyone here can...
10045 : Actually, seeing you here gives me an idea...
10046 : This humanoid can defeat the monster inside the World Eater Egg for us! I'm sure of it!
10047 : Kahpu-pah-pah. Kukahpi, kuru-ra, aaru. Kukah-pi, kahngu, pyan-kah.
10048 : Yes, I have heard the rumors. So, listen to the tale of the World Eater Egg.
10049 : Kwikuun... Kuare, kuwoo-kahnpiri, kei-oh. Kuepi, pipipi, kuuku-kwekwe.
10050 : A long time ago, there lived a terrible monster.
10051 : It refused to accept that which was new to the world.
10052 : It ate countless crystals, so that it could lay eggs that would destroy this new world.
10053 : However, before one of the eggs could hatch, it was dropped deep within the ocean.
10054 : There, the youngest and strongest member of a pod of pteraketos was chosen to serve as the egg's protector.
10055 : So it swallowed the egg, and dove further and further into the ocean depths.
10056 : It went so deep that the ocean was devoid of all light, and even time itself stood still.
10057 : Eventually, the egg's pulsations stopped, and the pteraketos watched over it until its dying days. And so, they arranged for a system of succession, so that their watch would never end.
10058 : Presently, the time for succession has come again. However, without an aeropearl, the pteraketos's successor won't be able to take the egg to a safe depth.
10059 : Why it feel like elder stop talking all of a sudden?
10060 : Anyways, World Eater Egg lie dormant for thousands of years. Can contents still be alive?
10061 : Well, if it's like time has stopped, then I doubt whatever's inside there is dead.
10062 : Kapuri-cho, kupiru-kupu, Qiqirn. Kwipi, rippu, pakupi Wajaom.
10063 : Humanoid, this smells like the work of the Qiqirn. Go to the Wajaom Woodlands and search for the aeropearl there.
10064 : Kubaah, kwipi, piripiri, pakupi Wajaom.
10065 : First, head for the spot in the Wajaom Woodlands that feels alive with energy.
10066 : Olduum, kurororo, kahru-kahru, kapuri-cho. Aaru, kapuri-cho, pikku-pippi, kupakaahn.
10067 : Th-the Olduum civilization is of humanoid origin. Therefore, its riddles can be solved by humanoids.
10068 : Elder, this one may be a good fighter, but I don't think it's really all that smart...
10069 : Oh well. I guess you'll just have to do.
10070 : Pakkeh.
10071 : Kah?
10072 : The apkallu elder has asked you to head for the spot in the Wajaom Woodlands that feels alive with energy.
10073 : Kah?
10074 : You recall the marolith riddle about a place you can never go back to...
10075 : Deliver the % to the apkallu elder.
10076 : Kah?
10077 : Kah!
10078 : Pazo, torakue. Kurukkah, pippi.
10079 : How do you respond? Kuen? Kapuri-cho.
10080 : Kah-pu, pah-pah. Kahppu.
10081 : Kuhlpopi! Can't I get a little time to prepare first... The heroes have left, along with the mage!
10082 : Kah-rah, kapuri-cho. Apukuppu.
10083 : Most impressive, humanoid! You must have been blessed by the divine spirits of the sea themselves!
10084 : Puka, kuepi kupukkuru, kuparu. Kurara, kuka-ku, pikkupi.
10085 : Although, it can't be used in its current state! The % must be repaired!
10086 : Pittsu, kapuri-cho, kahpu pah-pah, Olduum, kurororo. Pikkupi, kukah-ku.
10087 : Do you know any humanoid who can repair items from the Olduum civilization!?
10088 : Padon.
10089 : Please, we're counting on you, humanoid!
10090 : I am impressed! You actually managed to find the aeropearl!
10091 : The elder said you must be very wise and have seen many things in your travels!
10092 : The Goblins and that mage they call Uran-Mafran said it too! They said to just leave everything to you! And they were right!
10093 : Kah?
10094 : The apkallu elder has asked you to find a humanoid who can repair the %.
10095 : There is nobody here who can repair the %.
10096 : You must go to the Alzadaal Undersea Ruins in order to obtain %.
10097 : Kah!
10098 : First, you need to meet with Aznahf the corsair.
10099 : It's no use... This aeropearl is probably just an elaborate scam by the beastmen...
10100 : Heheh... What choice do we have? Unless we want to be pteraketos food, that is!
10101 : You showed the %.
10102 : Oh! You're a lifesaver!
10103 : Yeah, how will we ever repay you, %!?
10104 : Thank you, %.
10105 : I hate to admit it, but we were in real trouble there. This whole situation had our sails in a bunch.
10106 : Okay, everyone. Take this to the apkallu elder with % here.
10107 : Eh!? You want us to go too!?
10108 : Wh-what if they don't forgive us!?
10109 : If the legends are true, then the apkallu elder can be taken at his word.
10110 : And if you're that worried about it, at least go as far as the apkallu attendant.
10111 : % will handle the rest.
10112 : That way, we can at least keep up appearances.
10113 : And if it comes to it, we can flee on a moment's notice...
10114 : O-okay, I understand...
10115 : Our safety is in your hands... We'll meet you there.
10116 : <Sigh> Thanks for looking after those two. They're important to me and my crew.
10117 : <Sigh> I'm sorry about those two, but please look after them for me.
10118 : I'm curious about this apkallu treasure that no one has ever seen before...
10119 : Meet with the apkallu elder and give him the %.
10120 : Ah, there you are, %!
10121 : Can you understand what this apkallu's saying? We haven't got a clue!
10122 : Kah?
10123 : How will you respond? Kuppi.
10124 : Kah!
10125 : Wh-whoa...
10126 : Okay, %! We'll leave the rest in your capable hands!
10127 : Kah-rah, kapuri-cho. Apukuppu.
10128 : Yes, right away! Humanoid, you continue to impress! Indeed, the divine spirits of the sea smile upon you!
10129 : Pikkupi, pearl, kukkukira, keipu-apu. Kapuri-cho, keh-keh, ore, kepuapu.
10130 : The power of the aeropearl has been restored. Our guardian pteraketos has been saved!
10131 : The beastmen and humanoids are also safe. As is the ocean and the land!
10132 : Gupi-guppi, gugupi, pikkupi, keipu-apu. Pappi-kah, pipipi, gupi-guppi.
10133 : The one who piloted the ship is also safe. The elder has ordered everyone to stop searching for him.
10134 : Pippi-kupi. Kah-kahpi, kurah, pikku.
10135 : Here, this is for you. It is a treasure the likes of which none have ever seen!
10136 : Kuppi-kwo, kupukkuru, kufooh, pappa. Guguppi, kupin. Kuehpi-kuhn, kapuri-cho.
10137 : If you use it too much, you will become just like him. You'll lose your memories and won't be able to return to your humanoid form.
10138 : Wha!? E-Elder, what do you mean!?
10139 : Well? How'd it go!?
10140 : Th-that's excellent news!
10141 : We're saved!
10142 : %, you really saved us. We can't thank you enough.
10143 : Words can't express our gratitude, but it's the least we can do. Thanks again.
10144 : By the way...
10145 : Did you happen to get that amazing apkallu treasure that no one's ever seen before?
10146 : Well... I've definitely never seen anything like it before, but...
10147 : It sure doesn't look like much, does it...
10148 : Oh well. I'll tell the captain that the treasure was nothing special. Definitely not worth enough to fund his dice games for a new ship.
10149 : Humanoid means...apukariccho, yes?
10150 : Kah?
10151 : Kuppi!
