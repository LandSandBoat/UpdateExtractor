6996 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6997 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.
6998 : I'm halfway there...maybe?
6999 : [/Hmm./This is a good pace!/Hmm./Well, well./Just a little more./Come on!/I'm past the halfway point./Just a little more!/Well, well.] [/Not too much further to my next level./Not much more to my next level!/Still need a little more experience for my next level./It appears my next level is not far off at all./My next level is not too far away./I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!/Not long now until I gain another level./My next level is almost within sight!/It appears my next level is not far off at all.]
7000 : Hmm. Not too much further to my next level.
7001 : This is a good pace! Not much more to my next level!
7002 : Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
7003 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7004 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
7005 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
7006 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
7007 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
7008 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
7009 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
7010 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
7011 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7012 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
7013 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?
7014 : [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
7015 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
7016 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
7017 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
7018 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7019 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
7020 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7021 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7022 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7023 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7024 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7025 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7026 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7027 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7028 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7029 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7030 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7031 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7032 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7033 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7034 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7035 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7036 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7037 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7038 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7039 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7040 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7041 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7042 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7043 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7044 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7045 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7046 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7047 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7048 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7049 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7050 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7051 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7052 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7053 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7054 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7055 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7056 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7057 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7058 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7059 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7060 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7061 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7062 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7063 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7064 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7065 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7066 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7067 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7068 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7069 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7070 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7071 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7079 : I'm warmed up now. Time for a real attack!

7102 : How many enemies have we defeated? Only #. You can count that high, right...?
7103 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
7104 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
7105 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
7106 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].

7110 : The last enemy we took down was number #.
7111 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
7112 : Only # [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
7113 : We've beaten at least two...right?
7114 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
7115 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
7116 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...
7117 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7118 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7119 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7120 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7121 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7122 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7123 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7124 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7125 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7126 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7127 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7128 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7129 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7130 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7131 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7132 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7133 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7134 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7135 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7136 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7137 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7138 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7139 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7140 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7141 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7312 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
7313 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
7314 : Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
7315 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
7316 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
7317 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
7318 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
7319 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
7320 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
7321 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
7322 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
7323 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
7324 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
7325 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
7326 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
7327 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
7328 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
7329 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
7330 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
7331 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
7332 : You can only carry one %.
7333 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
7334 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
7335 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
7336 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
7337 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
7338 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
7339 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
7340 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
7341 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
7342 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
7343 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
7344 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
7345 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
7346 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...

10540 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
10541 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
10542 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
10543 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
10544 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
10545 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
10546 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
10547 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
10548 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
10549 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
10550 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
10551 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
10552 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
10553 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
10554 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
10555 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
10556 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
10557 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
10558 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
10559 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
10560 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
10561 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
10562 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
10563 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
10564 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
10565 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
10566 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
10567 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
10568 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
10569 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
10570 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
10571 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
10572 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
10573 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
10574 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
10575 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
10576 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
10577 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
10578 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
10579 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
10580 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
10581 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%
