6679 : Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of # Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have # Allied Notes.
6680 : Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
6681 : I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with %. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?
6682 : Step right this way to entaru your Rent-a-Roomie!
6683 : Say, I can reserve a Rent-a-Roomie for you. All your stuff will be taken from your Moggie-Woggie House and brought here!
6684 : Do you want to move to Jeuno? Right away. Not now, thanks.
6685 : Very well. I've completed the necessary procedure-wedures! Make yourself at home in your home away from home! Hehehe!
6686 : Oh, okay. Fine! Be that way!
6687 : Enter the residential area? Yes. No.
6688 : (DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!
6689 : Welcome, Master! This is your home, the Mog House, kupo!
6690 : I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!
6691 : I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!
6692 : First, the basics, kupo! Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to Mog House when you're in your Mog House, kupo!
6693 : Press it and the Mog House menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
6694 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
6695 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
6696 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
6697 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
6698 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
6699 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
6700 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
6701 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
6702 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
6703 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
6704 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
6705 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
6706 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
6707 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
6708 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
6709 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
6710 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
6711 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
6712 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
6713 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!
6714 : It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!
6715 : You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!
6716 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
6717 : Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
6718 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
6719 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
6720 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
6721 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
6722 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
6723 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
6724 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
6725 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
6726 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
6727 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
6728 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
6729 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
6730 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
6731 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
6732 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
6733 : It's all yours, kupo!
6734 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!
6735 : Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
6736 : I found this item in the back of one of the %'s drawers, kupo!
6737 : It's all yours, kupo!
6738 : I found this in the back of the %, kupo!
6739 : It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo! Here, take it, kupo!
6740 : I found this item inside the %, kupo!
6741 : Luck is on your side, kupo! Take it, kupo!
6742 : I fished this item out of the %, kupo!
6743 : It was very hard work, kupo... I'm very tired, kupo...
6744 : I found this behind the % painting, kupo!
6745 : This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6746 : Something clattered inside the % when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
6747 : It's all yours, kupo!
6748 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
6749 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6750 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
6751 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
6752 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
6753 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
6754 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
6755 : Each item of furniture you place using the Layout command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
6756 : When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!

6760 : mes9
6761 : TEST-No.#
6762 : I found % inside the %, kupo!
6763 : Kupo...? I sense that this % is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!
6764 : Master! Master! Look what I found underneath the % this morning, kupo!
6765 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
6766 : Look what I found in your %!
6767 : You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it. I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!
6768 : Your Mog Locker lease is valid until #/#/# #:#:#, kupo.
6769 : The lease on your Mog Locker has expired, kupo. Please trade % to me or to Fubruhn in Aht Urhgan Whitegate.
6770 : Your Mog Locker lease has been extended until #/#/# #:#:#, kupo!
6771 : Master, Master! I found this in the %, kupo!
6772 : It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
6773 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
6774 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
6775 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
6776 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
6777 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
6778 : Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
6779 : Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
6780 : We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
6781 : Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
6782 : Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your %, when this % just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
6783 : Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6784 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6785 : Look at what I found while cleaning out the %: %!
6786 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6788 : It all began with a raindrop,      or so the legend says...
6789 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
6790 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
6791 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
6792 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
6793 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
6794 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
6795 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
6796 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
6797 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
6798 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
6799 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
6800 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
6801 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
6802 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
6803 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
6804 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...
6805 : Do something? Read instructions. Change parameters. Teleport to key locations. Warp to home point. Receive items. Obtain 100,000,000 gil. Do nothing.
6806 : Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
6807 : But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!
6808 : Furthermore, you may trade a moogle storage slip to me to wipe it clean, or mystically entrust its entire contents to me. Quite convenient, wouldn't you say?

7034 : Fresh produce from Sarutabaruta!
7035 : I've got goods from Kolshushu.
7036 : Zulkheim imports are always on sale!
7037 : We're globetrotting for our stamp rally! I never rode on airships before. It was so awesome!
7038 : You know, stamp rallies are only for kids. Grown-ups can't play, only kids can!
7039 : Kids love the % and stamp rallies more than anything! And don't you forget it!
7040 : I rode an airship here for the first time, and I feel rotten! Ugh... I wanna go home.
7041 : I used up all the barf baskets they had. How am I supposed to make it home?
7042 : Wow! Jeuno's a nice town, just like the postcards! I wanna live here when I grow up.
7043 : Did you guys hear? This grown-up said [he/she] wanted %! Hahaha!
7044 : Who cares? Even grown-ups want %.
7045 : I took a number and stood in line, but they ran out, right before my eyes.
7046 : Hmm... Yeah, that kind of thing's known to happen. Well, you don't leave me much choice. I have an extra one, so I'll let you have it.
7047 : Wait... You had two this whole time? Aww, you could've at least offered me one!
7048 : But I won't give it away for nothing. Let's see... I need something from Jeuno to take home, so get me % and it's yours.
7049 : Well, it's not like I have a choice! You are just going to give it to Melina, aren't you? Scoundrel!
7050 : Wha... How'd you guess?
7051 : You can't hide anything from a woman!
7052 : Well, at any rate... I'll trade you my % for %. Better get moving before I change my mind!
7053 : I wanted it, too. If I only had that, I wouldn't have had to...
7054 : I heard you can find % somewhere around Castle Oztroja.
7055 : Whoa, it's a real %! Okay, here's your %. And don't come back saying you want to return it!
7056 : You're off to Delkfutt's Tower, eh? You be careful, now.
7057 : You're off to Delkfutt's Tower, eh?
7058 : Are you going to Delkfutt's Tower? That's right. No, I'm not.
7059 : Oh? My mistake, then.
7060 : It's so confusing with all the portals and trap doors in there. Ain't no walk in the park, [sonny/kiddo]!
7061 : But it's smooth sailing with this here %. I dug it up at the book fair the other day.
7062 : It's just another piece of paper to me, so... I know! I'll trade you % for it! Yeah, I love antiquities.

7075 : The flight bound for [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Kazham] is now [arriving/departing].
7076 : With the airships connecting Jeuno with the three nations, the flow of goods has become much more consistent. Nowadays, everything comes through Jeuno!
7077 : Of course, Jeuno is situated smack-dab in the middle of the three, so this town was destined to grow and prosper.
7078 : I think the airships are a subtle form of pressure on the other three nations. That way, Jeuno can maintain the current balance of power.
7079 : Nobody would want to upset the masters of such advanced technology, would they? Nope, can't blame Jeuno for keeping the secrets of airship-building to itself.

7086 : Proceed to the air travel agency? Yes. No.
7087 : Have a safe flight!
7088 : Enjoy your stay in Jeuno!
7089 : I can't believe those boats without wings can fly. I'll never ride on such a thing, so I walk everywhere.
7090 : I'm sure they're a fine way to get around, but the whole concept seems fake to me.
7091 : I lost my ticket, and now I can't get on board. It takes so long to get a new one! I hope you never have to go through this.
7092 : Would you care to see a map of Jeuno?
7093 : What do you say? Sure, show me. No, thanks.
7094 : You're in Port Jeuno.
7095 : Your % have been confiscated. You are temporarily suspended from boarding airships in Jeuno.
7096 : Hey, stop right there!
7097 : You are in possession of contraband! I'm sorry, but you'll have to surrender all prohibited goods!
7098 : Regulations also force me to temporarily revoke your airship privileges. Don't let this kind of thing happen again.
7099 : You have cleared customs.
7100 : I'm sorry, but your boarding rights have been temporarily revoked. Have a nice day.
7101 : Welcome to Port Jeuno, the busiest airship hub anywhere! You can't miss the awe-inspiring view of airships in flight!
7102 : You can board with % from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Lower Jeuno, but they're prohibitively expensive.
7103 : I've heard the archduke issues them now and then, but the chances of getting one that way are slim.
7104 : Port Jeuno must remain secure. After all, if anything happened to the archduke, it would change the world!
7105 : Have you ever flown on an airship? I'm sure you'll be amazed. With the clouds at your feet, you feel like a soaring eagle.
7106 : All of the struggle and toil down below seem petty from such lofty heights. Oh, how I wish we were born with wings!
7107 : Somebody just tried to smuggle in some contraband. You should watch out for scum like that.
7108 : What could those smugglers be thinking? I know the penalties are light, but it's such a careless thing to do.
7109 : If someone's in need, I'll gladly sign.
7110 : Best of luck with the petition. I'll cheer you on from the shadows.
7111 : The petition is complete.

7270 : I'd rather have a flowerrr like the one in Queen Leaute's garrrden.
7271 : Here, you can have this back.
7272 : A flowerrr, for me? I have to show this to Mister Chalvatot!
7273 : You know--you know--Mister Chalvatot is always rrreally happy when I bring him flowerrrs.
7274 : This little bouquet is just like the lovely bunch of flowers Mister Chalvatot gathered for me one time! Thank you so much!
7275 : Someday--someday--I'm gonna be just like Princess Claidie! Chalvatot said if I take rrreal good care of my flowerrrs that I could!
7276 : I'm gonna take these and plant them all around San d'Orrria! Thank you!!
7277 : If I only had %...
7278 : If I ever get %, I'm gonna plant it in Queen Leaute's garden!
7279 : Meooow! %! For me? Yeah!
7280 : Now--Now Queen Leaute's garden will be prrrettier than ever!
7281 : looks overwhelmingly pleased.
7282 : You've been so nice. I wanna give you something to say thanks...
7283 : has a light bulb over her head.
7284 : I got it! I got it! I'll tell you my secrrret!
7285 : (Meow meow meow meow...)
7286 : (Meow meow meow meow...)
7287 : You have learned your way through the back alleys of San d'Oria! Now you can exit to any area from your residence.
7288 : But don't tell anyone, okay?
7289 : looks very happy.
7290 : Secret Secret It's our little secret!
7291 : Another one? Another one? Forrr me? Yeah!
7292 : Wow! I'll take this and plant it in the garden rrright now!
7293 : ... Umm, but I don't have anything to give you in returrrn.
7294 : I'm sorrry, but I can't take this. Thanks anyway! You will come and see the flowers I planted in the garden, though, won't you? Won't you?

7305 : You find a grimy old box.
7306 : You wish to consign an order with me?
7307 : Consign an order? Yes. No, thanks.
7308 : Very well. Bring % from Castle Zvahl. Leave them and those gauntlets inside my toolbox, and I shall restore the gauntlets.
7309 : My work is finished.
7310 : What, you have something you want appraised? I mean, seriously! These days everyone says they find treasures in the auction. Nonsense, all of it!
7311 : See, within antiques sleep spirits of the past! Search carefully or you'll awaken their slumber!
7312 : If you're ready, show me your item and I'll start the appraisal.
7313 : Are you ready? You bet. Uh, give me a moment.
7314 : Very well. Let's see it!
7315 : Why, this is quite an old ring. And the years have not been kind! Look, I've found an inscription.
7316 : Hmm... No, I can't make it out. It's too much for the Goldsmiths' Guild. You'll need to bury it in perennial snow to wash away the filth!
7317 : Deep inside Xarcabard lies a snow untouched for a thousand years. Take your ring, bury it there to clean the grime, and come back here.
7318 : That's fine. I'm sure your antique would appreciate the privacy.
7319 : What? You still thinking about that antique ring?
7320 : Well, look at this! Clean as a whistle! Now, let's see what we can see...
7321 : Say, this is written in the elder script of San d'Oria. It's a fine ring, but I wonder what it says...
7322 : I suggest you take it to someone of respectable age in Chateau d'Oraguille.
7323 : Can't give it a price till you know its value, as we say in the business!
7324 : Take the ring to a person of respectable age in Chateau d'Oraguille. Can't give it a price till you know its value, as we say in the business!
7325 : Hello there, [sir/madam]. I've got a very fine item. Would you like to have a look?
7326 : It's no regular glass bead! Why, this particular item has a monster trapped inside!
7327 : Apparently, this monster has swallowed a treasure! And as long as it remains inside this ball, there's no way to get it out, right? Wrong!
7328 : I was told that the monster can be released by tossing it into burning circles and strange doorways located around Vana'diel.
7329 : What do you say? I've still got lots of them!
7330 : Give me # % and I'll give you %. Give me # of them for %. Or, give me #, and I'll let you have one of these %. What a deal, huh?
7331 : For just # %, I'll trade you %, %, or %. You'd be crazy to pass this offer up!
7332 : And how about # % for %, # for %, or # % for %? You won't be able to find a better price on goods like these anywhere in Vana'diel!
7333 : Oh ho, and what's this? % for # % or % for # of them. Why, these items are so brand-spankin' new, I didn't even know I had them!
7334 : Whoa there, friend! Walk away now and you'll miss the best part! Haha, that's right! This is a special offer for my favorite customer!
7335 : Let me lay it on the line for you--# %. That's all it'll take to get you this %. I'll say that again to make it sound even more impressive. %!
7336 : Or if you're looking to really splurge, how about # of those crests for %? This deal's so hot that if you don't take it, I just might buy it from myself!
7337 : Now, I normally don't go about telling people about this, but seeing as how you look like a well-informed buyer who's been around the port once or twice... I'll give you the opportunity to trade in either # % for % or # for %!
7338 : What'll it be, adventurer? Never mind. Exchange %. Exchange %. Exchange %. Exchange %. Exchange %. Retrieve %. Retrieve %. Retrieve %. Retrieve %. Retrieve %. Review conditions. Review unsealed orbs.
7339 : Select an orb. (You have # [seal/seals].) Never mind. % (# seals). % (# seals). % (# seals). % (# seals). % (# seals).
7340 : Select an orb. (You have # [seal/seals].) Never mind. % (# seals). % (# seals). % (# seals). % (# seals).
7341 : Select an orb. (You have # [crest/crests].) Never mind. % (# [crest/crests]). % (# [crest/crests]).
7342 : Select an orb. (You have # [crest/crests].) Never mind. % (# [crest/crests]). % (# [crest/crests]).

7344 : %? You sure, now? You'll be gettin' no refunds here, mind you.
7345 : Seal the deal on %? Yes, make it happen! No, belay that order!
7346 : Whoa, whoa, whoa! You think I'm running a charity, here? You ain't got enough % for that. Now get outta here and quit wasting my time!
7347 : All right, it's a deal. (Heh, what a sucker!)
7348 : Lemme see here... %, is it? Here we go. As of last count, you've got a balance of # %.
7349 : Let's see. When taken together with those you've already given me, I'm currently holding the following:
7350 : # %.
7351 : That should be about it. Lemme know if you need anything else.
7352 : Go easy there, [big fella/little lady]! You trying to bust my bank!? I can't hold onto anymore seals for you. Why don't you try trading some of them in for some orbs? (I can't believe I just said that...)
7353 : Excellent! # %. Now choose which orb you want. Remember, no refunds! (Heh, what a sucker.)
7354 : You already gave me # %. Now choose which orb you want.
7355 : Which orb do you want? %. %.
7356 : The merchant I bought it from told me that the monster can easily be released! Just toss it into the burning circles in Qu'Bia, the Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus.
7357 : Ah, that's right. I also seem to remember an impetuously inquisitive adventurer mentioning the seal on that orb can be broken in the Sacrificial Chamber, the Chamber of Oracles, and on the door of the Throne Room in Castle Zvahl.
7358 : The dealer I bought these from said that all you have to do is throw that orb into the burning circle in the Qu'Bia Arena or the shimmering circle in the Chamber of Oracles, and poof! Instant monster!
7359 : I think I remember somebody saying that orb can be used in burning circles located deep within the Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, and the Qu'Bia Arena. He also mentioned something about a door in Ghelsba...
7360 : The dealer that sold me that strange orb said that the monster inside could only be released by tossing it in burning circles in the Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus, or at some strange door in Ghelsba.
7361 : I think the dealer that sold me the Themis orbs said something about being able to release the monster in burning circles in the Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus.
7362 : The traveling merchant who sold me the orb said that the beast within can only be released in burning circles located deep within the Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus, or in the arcane halls of the Sacrificial Chamber, the Chamber of Oracles, and the Spire of Vahzl. He was a shady sort, though, so who can say whether his word can be trusted?
7363 : The traveling merchant who sold me the orb said that the beast within can only be released in burning circles located deep within the Yughott Grotto, the Palborough Mines, and Giddeus, or in the arcane halls of the Spires of Holla, Dem, and Mea. He was a shady sort, though, so who can say whether his word can be trusted?
7364 : The trader who I acquired these from was muttering something about terrible beasts sealed away in the far-off reaches of Bearclaw Pinnacle and the Boneyard Gully. I give you fair warning though: there was something...unsettling about that man. That knotted, grime-ridden mess of hair reaching almost to the ground, that glint of madness in his bloodshot eyes...
7365 : The peddler who sold these to me was cackling wildly about ferocious beasts sealed away in the depths of Mine Shaft #2716 and Monarch Linn--wherever that might be. If you trust the words of a drooling old crone with gnarled, mold-encrusted fingernails as long as her arms and breath fouler than a bugbear's, you're welcome to try hunting them down.
7366 : Oh, dear! I see a crack here. It's worthless now, so I'll dispose of it. But, I've still got more!
7367 : It looks like your bag is full. Try coming back when you've made some more room in it. Don't worry. I'll hold onto your % until you get back. I'm a businessman.
7368 : Hey there, [buddy ol' pal/gorgeous]! Have I ever got the offer of a lifetime for you.
7369 : You see, I've been commissioned by my suppliers to come up with some accounts involving orbs to determine interest in their product.
7370 : I guess you could say I'm testing the waters of industry. Anyway, if I don't do this, they'll cut me off, which means you'll get cut off. So, mind lending a few minutes of your time to trusty Shami here?
7371 : You don't have to tell me right now about the battles you've fought with the orbs I've kindly given you in exchange for %, of course. I'd never pressure my best buyer into doing something [he/she] didn't want to.
7372 : Oh, now's the perfect time? Well, the customer's always right! Gimme some juicy gossip about your orb-related exploits.
7373 : Orb-related exploits: I have no further business with you. Tails of Woe. ([Unfinished/Conquered/With Honors]) The Worm's Turn. ([Unfinished/Conquered/With Honors]) Steamed Sprouts.

7374 : I see, I see, I see... [Supply's drowning out any demand./If that's the case, then the status quo's probably good to go!/Amazing! You've been smiting everything left and right!] (I wonder how this'll impact my kickbacks.)
7375 : You will need % to travel to the Outlands by air. You may apply for one at the designated counter.
7376 : This is the counter for the air route to the Outlands. Our airships connect Jeuno with the southeastern island of Elshimo.
7377 : This is the counter for the Outlands air route. How may I be of assistance today?
7378 : What is your business here? Just passing by. I want % issued. Tell me about the adventurers' deal.
7379 : Yes, with % you can travel freely between Jeuno and Kazham. The price is a mere # gil, and there is no expiration date.
7380 : If you cannot afford our already low price, we are offering, for a limited time, the adventurers' deal. Would you like to hear more on this offer?
7381 : Listen to the explanation? Yes. No. Buy %.
7382 : Yes, the adventurers' deal. All you have to do is find these three keys: %, %, and %.
7383 : The adventurers' deal consists of finding the following three keys: %, %, and %.
7384 : Once you have gathered them all, give them to me and I will check to see if they are authentic.
7385 : %...%...and %. Yes, they seem to be authentic.
7386 : I have issued % under the name of %. It has been approved for immediate use.
7387 : I am sorry, but this is not one of the items in the deal.
7388 : You must bring %, %, and %.
7389 : Yes [sir/ma'am]. If you need any information on the air routes to the Outlands, feel free to inquire at any time.
7390 : We hope you enjoy flying with us!
7391 : I am sorry, but you do not have enough gil.
7392 : Buy %? Not today. Yes.
7393 : I'm sorry there, [son/miss], but I can only allow one exchange a week per adventurer. Come back again later.
7394 : This is the departure gate for airship passengers. If you have any questions, please inquire with Guddal.
7395 : Delivering goods to residences everywhere!
7396 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7397 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7398 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7399 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7400 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7401 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7402 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7403 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7404 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7405 : You've earned conquest points!
7406 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7407 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7408 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7409 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7410 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7411 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7412 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7413 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7414 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7415 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7416 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7417 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7418 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7419 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7420 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7421 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7422 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7423 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7424 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7425 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7426 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7427 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7428 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7429 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7430 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7431 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7432 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7433 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7434 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7435 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7436 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7437 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7438 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7439 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7440 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7441 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7442 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.
7443 : Which E.F. would you like to join? . . . . . . The Zulkheim Region (Lv.20). The Norvallen Region (Lv.25). . The Derfland Region (Lv.25). . The Kolshushu Region (Lv.20).

7444 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
7445 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
7446 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
7447 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
7448 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
7449 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
7450 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.

7454 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
7455 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
7456 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.
7457 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 100 conquest points.
7458 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 200 conquest points.
7459 : During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
7460 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
7461 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.

7477 : Which service do you request? Buy/Sell items. Teleportation. Nothing.
7478 : Do you really wish to be teleported? Yes. Teleport with gil. Teleport with conquest points. No.
7479 : Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
7480 : It should please you to know that I now also deal in %. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!
7481 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
7482 : I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
7483 : I can teleport you to your home country for # gil or # conquest [point/points].
7484 : Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered.  Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
7485 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
7486 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
7487 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
7488 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
7489 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.

7493 : Sorry. I can only take certain types of weapons, shields, or armor.
7494 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points [by a small amount/moderately/greatly]. For this transaction I will also furnish you with # gil.
7495 : My apologies, but this type of item needs to be individually appraised. Please trade them to me one at a time.
7496 : (DEBUG) Back to hometown!
7497 : What do you want? Would you cast Signet on me? I'd like to set my home point here. Nothing.

7500 : You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.

7502 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
7503 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
7504 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
7505 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
7506 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
7507 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
7508 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
7509 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.

7511 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.
7512 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
7513 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
7514 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
7515 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
7516 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
7517 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
7518 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...

7523 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
7524 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
7525 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
7526 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
7527 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
7528 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
7529 : You received # conquest points!
7530 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
7531 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
7532 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
7533 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
7534 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
7535 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
7536 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
7537 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
7538 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
7539 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
7540 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
7541 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
7542 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
7543 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
7544 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
7545 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
7546 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
7736 : PAUSE
7738 : This flight is full.
7739 : I got no business with a flea like you. Get outta my face before I decide to messy-wess you up.
7740 : You're %, right? Ha ha ha! I knew it! Just like Gilgamesh described. Lemme tell you what I gotty-wot so far.
7741 : The creepy-weep that stole our helmet isn't from any large syndicate. He isn't even very famous among other pirates. He's just a simple thiefy-weef trying to pull off a big job for a big profit.
7742 : According to the owner of that inn, he traveled numerous timey-wimes between here and Selbina, and would sometimes talk about his plans after a few too many drinky-winks. But then one day, he just disappeared.
7743 : After looking at Norg's nautical loggy-wogs, I learned that the time he disappeared matches the time he must have entered our headquarters. But where he went from therey-where, I don't know.
7744 : Wa-wa-wait! There's something else.
7745 : One of our men in Bastok is piecing together all the information we've gathered so far. He's hiding out in a run-down old housey-wouse in the Mines District (J-6). He should be able to give you something juicy-wuicy.
7746 : I thought that this might have been the work of some large groupy-woop, but when I heard that it was just one guy...boy, was I surprisey-wised!
7747 : I can understand wanting to makey-wake it big overnight, but he should have thought a little bitty-wit longer before deciding to take us on!
7748 : Would you mind leaving me alone? I have no time for small talk.
7749 : You are %, are you not? I have been waiting for your arrival. I do not have much time, so I will keep this quick.
7750 : The day of the theft, there were numerous reports of a strange character wearing an even stranger helmet traveling on foot towards Zulkheim.
7751 : I journeyed here from San d'Oria, but heard nothing of such sightings on my way. This leaves the possibility that he may have turned back to Jeuno.
7752 : I feel that he may still be in the area. I am going to continue my search here.
7753 : And one other thing.
7754 : One more of us is stationed in a small, run-down building in the Bastok Mines (J-6). He may have some useful information.
7755 : The type of helmet that was stolen is known in the Far East as a kabuto. Many people find its design strange, but I find it quite interesting.
7756 : You're finally here, %.
7757 : I've heard of you from my associates in Norg. As much as I would like to sit and chat with you about your adventures, we must work quickly to find our thief. I have just received a new piece of information and will be setting out shortly to investigate.
7758 : To the northeast of here is a place called the Palborough Mines. I've received information on several adventurers sighting a young man wearing a strangely shaped helmet journeying deep into those caves.
7759 : This is more than likely the same character that Sanosuke learned of in Jeuno. But why would he head to the Palborough Mines? I'm heading there myself to find out.
7760 : I have heard that the Quadav made that place into one of their strongholds. I wonder if there could be some connection...
7761 : You may journey to the mines with me if you wish. When you have made your preparations, meet me there. I will be waiting.
7762 : I-it's you...
7763 : We're too...late. He's already...passed through the...portal. The seal...on the helmet...won't hold much...longer.
7764 : Unless you want to end up...like me, don't...touch the burning circle. It's protected...by a powerful curse.
7765 : Hurry...back to Norg and tell...them what's happened. Get something to...break the curse...keep the demon...from escaping...
7766 : .........
7767 : He has lost consciousness.
7768 : The time has come for me to rise again... I am no longer bound by the chains that annoying Hume forced upon me...
7769 : Many a night I wasted away, rotting in the darkness of my prison...
7770 : Gnyah-hah-hah! But Humes are a frail species. They grow old and wither away. The one who sent me to my hell is no more...
7771 : Now there are none who can stand in my way!
7772 : What is this? I sense someone approaching... Someone with the same power as that Hume...
7773 : You did it!
7774 : The seal was broken, but thanks to you, the demon has been put to rest.
7775 : Our ancestors' % has been damaged, but its tattered appearance is proof of the evil sprit's demise. Take this back to Norg and inform them of your deeds.
7776 : Much of the cursed seal still remains. I will remain here and attempt to clear the rest of it away. Until we meet again, %!
7777 : The % has been badly damaged... You obtain %.
7778 : The % you carry has lost its effectiveness. You may dispose of it now.
7779 : You've cleared Samurai AF 2!
7780 : You don't have %!

7786 : It was quite some time ago now, but I saw this young Elvaan girl heading into that cave with a fishing rod in her hand.
7787 : When she came back, she told me some damn huge octopus had whipped the rod right out of her grasp...
7788 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
7789 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.

7838 : <Match #> Entry period begins:  Briefing begins:

7841 : Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of # gil is required before each match.

7843 : What would you like to know about? Basic rules. Official/private matches. Flammen-Brenner. Flamme. Match score. Petras and quarrying. Sprint. KO. Return.
7844 : The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:
7845 : First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of Flammen-Brenner.
7846 : At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with Flamme, or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
7847 : Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
7848 : The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
7849 : The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
7850 : If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The match score section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
7851 : Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
7852 : You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
7853 : No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
7854 : The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed # members, or if there are fewer than # members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
7855 : Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
7856 : LS Liga is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
7857 : A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
7858 : The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
7859 : If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
7860 : After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
7861 : Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
7862 : In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
7863 : Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
7864 : Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
7865 : However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
7866 : Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
7867 : Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
7868 : The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
7869 : In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
7870 : In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
7871 : I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
7872 : Looking for someone? Give me a name and maybe I can help.

7929 : A little girl? Could that child over there be the one you're looking for?
7930 : Mom, do you think the mirror is somewhere else after all?
7931 : Who can say, dear? The looking glass carried by the adventurer that saved you was similar, but not the one we're looking for.
7932 : It's just that when the adventurer talked about using a mirror to find me, I thought we had found it...
7933 : Oh well, I guess we have to keep looking.
7934 : I was so happy that someone came and saved me, though!
7935 : Me too, sweetheart. I'm so glad you're safe.
7936 : It just froze my heart when you told me about that strange man.
7937 : I'm sorry...
7938 : He told me that he saw someone carrying a black mirror into those horrible tunnels.
7939 : He said he would help me look, and then disappeared once we were inside...
7940 : I'll never go off alone with anyone, even if they say they know about the mirror!
7941 : I certainly hope not. You'll make your mother sick with worry.
7942 : Hi, Palometa. How've you been?
7943 : Palometa! How've you been?
7944 : Palometa. Good to see you again.
7945 : Palometa. You've been well, I trust?
7946 : Hey there, Palometa. How're you doing?
7947 : Palometa! I hope you've been well.

7949 : Palometa! Good to see you!

7974 : How come you know about that? How do you know about the guardians?
7975 : Ah! The Glass of All-Seeing!
7976 : But...I'm not a guardian.
7977 : The guardians were responsible for protecting the mirror...
7978 : But they're all gone now...
7979 : That doesn't sound prrromising.
7980 : You know all about the guardians, rrright, Palometa?
7981 : Right. My daddy was one. Until he got sick and had to leave us...
7982 : Oh...
7983 : After Daddy was gone, someone came and stole the mirror.
7984 : I was so scared...
7985 : But now I've come to this country with my mother to get the mirror back.
7986 : Do you know anything about the mirror, Miss Luto? Please tell me if you do...!
7987 : I...I have to get it back. My daddy spent his life protecting it...!
7988 : I know, kiddo. Just calm down and I'll tell you what I can.
7989 : I have the mirror that you're searching for.
7990 : What?
7991 : But the mirror's been broken...
7992 : No! It can't be...!
7993 : We've been looking for a way to fix it. And our search has led us to you, the daughter of one of the guardians.
7994 : To repair the mirror, we need to learn a certain charm. You wouldn't happen to know anything like that, would you?
7995 : A charm...? Is that like a prayer?
7996 : Something that only a guardian would know.
7997 : I think I do. My daddy taught me a prayer with some really hard words. But I can say them all!
7998 : Rrreally! That's wonderful! Maybe there is hope for the mirror yet.
7999 : I'll be happy just to see this trrreasure back in one piece.
8000 : As soon as we fix your mirror, we'll give it back to you, okay?
8001 : Okay!
8002 : Until then, I think you should stay here in Jeuno. Better yet, rrright by my side!
8003 : I don't want anything happening to you.
8004 : It looks like I'll be needing your help again. All that's left is to find some of the metal used in creating the mirror.
8005 : I'll keep porrring through Looking Glass Legends and see what I can find.
8006 : You'll be the first to know if I learn anything useful.
8007 : Phew! Keeping up a facade is hard work. I was almost feeling sorry for that little girl.
8008 : Besides that unusual metal, I have everything I need for repairing the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.
8009 : I'll have that mirror in one piece if it's the last thing I do!
8010 : I wonder who this author of Looking Glass Legends could be.
8011 : Anyone who can gather this sort of information alone is not to be underestimated...
8012 : Wait a moment... You are an adventurer, are you not? I hear your sort does all kinds of things--fighting with monsters, cooking, and collecting all sorts of little knickknacks...
8013 : Oh, I am truly sorry if I have offended you. I am from a land far to the east of here, and tales of adventurers are quite popular in my hometown.
8014 : Anyway, you adventurers are quite the rowdy lot, always playing outside and showing up looking as if you had wallowed in mud, correct?
8015 : Are you really so dirty? Give me some mud to wallow in! No! My equipment glistens!
8016 : My goodness, it is true! In that case, you must need powerful detergent to remove your stains, and I happen to have exactly what you need! This solution was developed by the most skilled alchemists in the entire Near East. Surely a must-have for any adventurer!
8017 : Now for the all-time low price of # gil!
8018 : Buy the detergent for # gil? Yes. No. Being dirty is fun!
8019 : Well then, here you are! I will only give you enough for one cleaning, though. Using any more than that would erode cermet!
8020 : Oh? I am afraid you do not have enough gil.
8021 : Oh my, such confidence. Could it be because you possess that remarkable armor I have heard about in rumors...artifact armor, I believe it is called?
8022 : I am not finished, so wait! Undoubtedly your artifact armor was once something to take pride in, but at present it is surely quite battered from your adventuring, not to mention that it has simply become old and could use a boost...correct?
8023 : If I were you, my dear friend, I would take your precious artifact armor and restore it! Rejuvenate it! Give it new life! Does that not sound like the proper course of action?
8024 : I know exactly what you need. You absolutely must bring the necessary ingredients, and I will send them with your artifact armor to the craftsmen of the Near East for a miniscule fee in %!
8025 : There, I have contracts with the most skilled artisans, who will make your artifact armor shine like never before.
8026 : Of course, it shall be difficult for you to give up your beloved artifact armor, if but for a short while. However, please inform me if you work up the courage, and I will tell you the ingredients I require.
8027 : Which set would you like to know about? None. Fighter's Armor. Temple Attire. Healer's Attire. Wizard's Attire. Warlock's Armor. Rogue's Attire. Gallant Armor. Chaos Armor. Beast Armor. Choral Attire. Hunter's Attire. Myochin Armor. Ninja Garb. Drachen Armor. Evoker's Attire. Magus Attire. Corsair's Attire. Puppetry Attire. Dancer's Attire. Scholar's Attire.
8028 : Which item would you like to know about? None. %. %. %. %. %.
8029 : In order to restore the %, you must bring me %, %, and %. Also, I require # ) for expenses.
8030 : When restoration is complete, your artifact armor will look like this!
8031 : I require the % up front. They are quite valuable to collectors in the Near East, and I am sure that you would like to clear up valuable space, yes?
8032 : Yes, what do you require? Would you like some powerful detergent?
8033 : What would you like? Just wanted to chat. Ask about the detergent. Ask about relic restoration.
8034 : What would you like? Just wanted to chat. Buy detergent. Ask about artifact restoration. Ask about %. Retrieve % (Max: #). Ask about relic restoration.
8035 : In order to restore the %, you must bring me %, %, and %. I ask that you submit them all together.
8036 : I require # ) as payment. Thus far, you have given me #.
8037 : Why %, you ask? To be quite frank, I do not know much about them beyond the fact that they were used as currency by the turtle-like beastmen of this continent, but they happen to be quite valuable among Near Eastern collectors.
8038 : Thus far, you have given me # %.
8039 : If you would like, I will exchange merchandise for your coins. Would you happen to have any?
8040 : You have not yet given me any %.
8041 : Exchange %? I changed my mind. % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins). % (# coins).
8042 : I regret to inform you that you do not have enough % for that item.
8043 : You adventurers truly are amazing. You have an eye for fine goods. It may not look like much, but this item is of the highest quality.
8044 : %? Are you sure? No, give me more time. Yes, that's what I want.
8045 : # ), correct? This brings your current total to # %. Please take care not to lose track.
8046 : I apologize, but I cannot take any more % from you.
8047 : You have collected the proper materials, but unfortunately you lack the required amount of % for payment.
8048 : You need # ), but you have only given me # thus far. That would not even pay the cost of postage to the Near East and back!
8049 : Your artifact armor will be handled with utmost care. Now if you please, I will send it with the materials you have collected to the craftsmen of the Near East. But fear not, as it shall be worth the wait.
8050 : Your % is still undergoing restoration in the Near East. Please wait a while longer.
8051 : I apologize for the wait. The restored % just arrived from the Near East. May it be of help in your adventures.
8052 : I must apologize. I am currently out of stock, so would you please come back a bit later?
8053 : The next shipment is not scheduled to come in until  ( Earth time).
8054 : Hm? It seems that you already possess some %... You must be very skilled in the ways of commerce. I can see it in your eyes.
8055 : I came from the Near East to peddle my wares. I heard that there are simply hordes of gullib--err, that is, I have heard of the great adventurers that roam this land, and wish to be of service to them. If you happen to know of any seasoned adventurers, I ask that you bring them to me. Be sure to tell them of my fabulous goods!
8056 : What's this? You wish for me to return some of your %? You surprise me, %. I would not have taken you for a collector, but I suppose one should never judge a coin by its coinpurse.
8057 : I currently have # of your %. How many do you wish to retrieve?
8058 : Very well. # it is, then.
8059 : I cannot return more than the # you have entrusted to me. I am a collector, not a treasury--I am not in the business of offering loans.
8060 : As you wish.
8061 : Oho! You have quite the discerning eye, friend. I'd be happy to take that % off your hands.
8062 : Whatever luster this piece once had has long since faded away. I fear it would be of little value to me.
8063 : What a positively pristine specimen! This should prove a popular collector's item across the Near East. I can give you # % for it. What do you say?
8064 : ...And the deal is done! Always a pleasure to do business with you, %.
8065 : # %? Are you sure? No, give me more time. Yes, that's what I want.
8066 : It simply cannot be! You say you possess the legendary relic armor?
8067 : They say that relic armor was specially created by the best craftsmen in Vana'diel during the Great War in order to resist the Kindred, and was available only to the very best of the elite forces!
8068 : That such powerful equipment could actually exist is unthinkable!
8069 : However, while relic armor is incredibly powerful, yours is rather worn, and perhaps even cursed!
8070 : If you hand your precious relic armor over to me, I could do all kinds of fantastic research on...
8071 : Ahem, that is, I could make it shine like new! So how about it? It's worth a try, is it not?
8072 : Here is what you must do: First, you must bring me an item that is the same as your relic armor, even if it is so ragged that it can no longer be worn.
8073 : I also require ancient currency from the main three Western nations as a fee.
8074 : Why ancient currency? Because in the Near East we find traditional gil more trustworthy than modern fluff!
8075 : I can ship your relic armor off to the guilds of the Near East, and when you see it next, it will be in mint condition!
8076 : However, I realize that you must be mentally prepared if you are to hand your treasure over to be sent across the seas. Just let me know when you are ready, and I will inform you of the items necessary for restoration.
8077 : Which set would you like to know about? None. Warrior's Armor. Melee Attire. Cleric's Attire. Sorcerer's Attire. Duelist's Armor. Assassin's Attire. Valor Armor. Abyss Armor. Monster Armor. Bard's Attire. Scout's Attire. Saotome Armor. Koga Garb. Wyrm Armor. Summoner's Attire. Mirage Attire. Commodore Attire. Pantin Attire. Etoile Attire. Argute Attire.
8078 : In order to restore the %, you must bring me % to use for mending, as well as %.
8079 : Your fee, including transportation, will come to # %.
8080 : Your relic armor will be in good hands with me, and I personally guarantee its safe return.
8081 : Thank you for your patronage. I will send your relic armor to the craftsmen of the Near East, but it may take some time before it is returned. I ask for your understanding in this matter.
8082 : Wait a moment... You are an adventurer, are you not? I hear your sort does all kinds of things--fighting with monsters, cooking, and collecting all sorts of little knickknacks...
8083 : Oh, I am truly sorry if I have offended you. I am from a land far to the east of here, and tales of adventurers are quite popular in my hometown.
8084 : Anyway, I have heard rumors that you adventurers wear relic armor--amazing equipment that harnesses fantastic power! Could such a thing possibly be true?
8085 : Do you possess relic armor? Of course! Unfortunately not.
8086 : But of course. It is just a silly rumor, after all. I beg your pardon.
8087 : Have you decided to entrust your relic armor to me? Just let me know if you have, and I will inform you of the items necessary for restoration.
8088 : You feel the bonds between you and your adventuring fellow strengthen!
8089 : Your cooperation and trust will make the task of repairing the mirror a simple one. I'm counting on you!
8090 : You can rely on us. Right, %?
8091 : You can rely on us! Right, %?
8092 : You can rely on us. Right, %?
8093 : You can rely on us. Right, %?
8094 : You can rely on us. Right, %?
8095 : You can rely on us. Right, %?

8101 : You can rely on us. Right, %?
8102 : %'s badge flashes brightly.
8103 : [Sir/Ma'am]! That badge you are wearing is from Al Zahbi, correct? Yes, I see it now. This badge contains a crystal compass. See the little button on the side of it? Try pressing it.
8104 : Well? Can you see letters on it? Those are the names of your targets.
8105 : Your targets are anyone who might be interested in this badge. It seems that Salaheem's Sentinels collected the names of anyone who may be interested and recorded their data beforehand.
8106 : Just the sort of tactic that cheapskate company would employ, if you ask me.
8107 : So the Near East is recruiting mercenaries, are they? They must have something in their lands worth protecting.
8108 : We guard the archduke, but I wonder what they are protecting in Aht Urhgan...
8109 : I've heard that the technology of Aht Urhgan has developed along quite different lines than that of Bastok.
8110 : Of course, airship technology has been our greatest achievement, but I've heard outlandish rumors about the Near East. One even says that they've created living creatures with their alchemy skills! Tales like that run chills down my spine.
8111 : Surprise!
8112 : Karl's badge flashes brightly.
8113 : Ta-da!
8114 : Jaha Amariyo's badge flashes brightly.
8115 : Check it out!
8116 : Buntz's badge flashes brightly.
8117 : Oh, I've heard rumors about that company's president...
8118 : Apparently, she's extremely aggressive and won't let anything she can use to her advantage slip through her iron grip. They say even the most hardened, rugged Galka becomes like a sheep for the slaughter around her.
8119 : Visit the Chocobo Circuit? Off to the races! Not right now.
8120 : The door is locked...
8121 : You see a single, ivory venture roll die on the table. There are currently #/# other players wishing to participate.
8122 : What would you like to do? Join table (# gil). Leave. Read manual.
8123 : There are currently #/# players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)
8124 : You place # gil in the pot.
8125 : The final participant has arrived. Your group is allowed # [minute/minutes] at the table.
8126 : %'s primary roll is #!
8127 : Double up? (Currently: #) Yes. No.
8128 : % doubles up... Your venture roll total is now #!
8129 : % doubles up... BUST!!!
8130 : % holds fast.
8131 : Double up complete.
8132 : Results...
8133 : %'s final total is #!
8134 : % has gone BUST!
8135 : The game has ended in a draw!
8136 : The winner is %!
8137 : Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.
8138 : The final place at the table has already been taken.
8139 : You do not have enough gil.
8140 : Someone has dropped the die!
8141 : Read which chapter? 1. The Heart of Venture Roll. 2. Rules of the Roll. 3. Putting the Book Down.
8142 : Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.
8143 : Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (doubling up) as many times as the table time limit allows (# [minute/minutes], Earth time).
8144 : In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (hold fast).
8145 : If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.
8146 : Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).
8147 : Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.
8148 : If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a draw and all participation fees are repaid in full.
8149 : Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.
8150 : Looking for someone? Maybe I can help.

8159 : But if you could tell me something else about this person, say, their personality, I might just remember something.
8160 : What kind of personality? Sullen. Passionate. Calm and collected. Serious. Childish. Suave.
8161 : What kind of personality? Sisterly. Lively. Agreeable. Naive. Serious. Domineering.
8162 : He has a [sullen/passionate/calm and collected/serious/childish/suave] personality? Yes. No.
8163 : She has [a sisterly/a lively/an agreeable/a naive/a serious/a domineering] personality? Yes. No.
8164 : Hmmm... I certainly didn't see anyone like that around here. Why don't you ask around in other parts of town?
8165 : Hey, what's the big idea, asking me to return something that you've handed over of your own volition?
8166 : <Sigh>... Fine, then. Just don't go spreading lies about how I don't look after my customers. I have # % of yours. So, how many do you want back?
8167 : Just to double-check, that's # %. Here you go.
8168 : What? Changing your mind again? Not that I'm complaining or anything...
8169 : Whoa, whoa, whoa! You think you can pull a fast one on me? I ain't got no more than # of your %. Now, let's try this again.
8170 : You want somethin' from me? Well, too bad. I don't want nothin' from you. Get lost.
8171 : Yeah? You want somethin' from me?

8173 : So you want %...that right?
8174 : How you gonna make it worth my while? Eh? Bring me %, %, and % and I just might think about it...maybe. If I feel like it.
8175 : You gonna make it worth my while? Eh? Bring me %, %, and % and I just might think about it...maybe. If I feel like it.
8176 : Then you give me %, %, and % and we gotta deal. Whaddaya think?
8177 : Accepting the % will trigger a time limit for the quest, Gatherer of Light.
8178 : Make the trade? It's a deal! On second thought...
8179 : Then why you waste my time? Get lost.
8180 : Done deal. Deal is done. You a real sucker--<cough>--I mean, good customer. Come back soon. And don't forget the goods.
8181 : Hey, you already got %. What you tryin' to pull here? Save some for my other customers, eh?
8182 : Whoa, whoa! Slow down there, bud. Gimme some time to sort out the stuff you just sold me, why don't ya?
8183 : How ya gonna make it worth my while? Eh? I got it. How 'bout ya fetch me %? Yeah, that should do the trick.
8184 : [////////////] Where can ya find it!? Ya need me to tell ya everything? Bah, fine. My buddies say they saw a moogle actin' all suspicious-like over in [La Theine Plateau/Valkurm Dunes/Jugner Forest/Konschtat Highlands/Pashhow Marshlands/Tahrongi Canyon/Buburimu Peninsula/Meriphataud Mountains/The Sanctuary of Zi'Tah/Yuhtunga Jungle/Yhoator Jungle/Western Altepa Desert/Eastern Altepa Desert]. And that's the straight Gobbie dope.
8185 : How you gonna make it worth my while? Eh? Bring me %, and I just might think about it...maybe. If I feel like it.
8186 : You see these six magic seals? They're worthless, but the counterseals they're attached to'll fetch a good price. Get the seals off of say...three of 'em for me, and I'll give ya the goods.
8187 : Oho! Looks like you got # [counterseal/counterseals]. You wanna trade [it/'em] for %?
8188 : It'll cost ya three counterseals...no wait, more! Ahhh, I'll take whatever ya got, but no less than three. Deal?
8189 : Then you fetch me %, %, %, and %.
8190 : That ain't all! I'll be needin' % and %, too. Then it's a deal.
8191 : You give me %, %, %, %...
8192 : Also % and %, and it's a done deal. Sound good?
8193 : Why, you greedier than Grand Greedalox! You want goods, you pay me both gil and beastmen's seals. Or we no do business.
8194 : What you want? None of these. 3 Seedspalls. %. %. 4 Mana Orbs. %. %. %. 8 Star Tree Sap Crystals. 16 Tablets of Hexes.
8195 : That'll cost ya # gil and # beastmen's [seal/seals]. The seals I get straight from Shami. I got a deal goin' with him, ya see.
8196 : Huh? You don't got enough beastmen's seals! You tryin' to waste my time? Take a hike!
8197 : Huh? You don't got enough gil! You tryin' to waste my time? Take a hike!
8198 : So it's the set of [three Seedspalls/four Mana Orbs/eight sap crystals/sixteen Tablets of Hexes] you want? That right?
8199 : Acquire a set of [three Seedspalls/four Mana Orbs/eight sap crystals/sixteen Tablets of Hexes]? Yes, please. On second thought...
8200 : Acquire %? Yes, please. On second thought...
8201 : You obtain a set of [eight sap crystals/sixteen Tablets of Hexes]!
8202 : Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
8203 : I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain %.
8204 : Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
8205 : May I be of service? Not now. Learn recipes. Check fewell. Replenish fewell. Purchase materials. Receive training. Trade cinder. Get information.
8206 : Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
8207 : ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
8208 : I've got it! How about %? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...

8227 : There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
8228 : But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your % for a moment...
8229 : Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: # # # # # # # #.
8230 : Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
8231 : Replenish fewell? Yes. No.
8232 : Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
8233 : ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
8234 : Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for # gil.  How does that sound?
8235 : Pay # gil? Deal! No thanks.
8236 : Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
8237 : I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
8238 : Excellent! Now we just pop open your % here, and...
8239 : There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
8240 : Your % has been filled to capacity!
8241 : You hand the synergy engineer # gil.
8242 : How do you expect me to do that when your % is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
8243 : Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
8244 : Purchase something? Not today. # %: # gil. # ): # gil. # ): # gil.
8245 : For # %, that comes to # gil.
8246 : Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
8247 : ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
8248 : And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
8249 : Train in which technique? Cancel. Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: #) Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: #) Safety lever. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: #) Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: #)
8250 : You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
8251 : It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
8252 : Train in this technique? Yes. No.
8253 : Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
8254 : ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
8255 : ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
8256 : ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
8257 : <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
8258 : ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
8259 : Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level #!
8260 : Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
8261 : Trade in your cinder? (Currently: # Pz) Not now. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. # gil: # Pz.
8262 : This is what you want, correct?
8263 : Make the exchange? Yes. No.
8264 : It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
8265 : Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
8266 : You transferred # Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. # Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
8267 : Ask about what? Nothing. Synergy furnaces. Synergy overview. Synergy procedure. Synergy recipes. Fewell replenishment. Materials for sale. Synergy techniques. Trading cinder.
8268 : The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
8269 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
8270 : Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
8271 : Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
8272 : You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
8273 : Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
8274 : This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call fewell. To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
8275 : As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
8276 : With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
8277 : The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
8278 : But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
8279 : If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
8280 : Take heart, though, as any materials inside your % will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
8281 : Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
8282 : Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
8283 : Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
8284 : You may be asking yourself, Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?
8285 : Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
8286 : The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
8287 : Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of %, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
8288 : Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that % may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
8289 : Mind you, % is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
8290 : Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
8291 : First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
8292 : You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
8293 : Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
8294 : You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
8295 : From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
8296 : Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
8297 : Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
8298 : However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
8299 : If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
8300 : You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
8301 : The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
8302 : It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
8303 : This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
8304 : As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
8305 : For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
8306 : You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
8307 : In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
8308 : Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
8309 : If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
8310 : Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
8311 : What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
8312 : The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
8313 : ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
8314 : Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
8315 : Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
8316 : Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
8317 : The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
8318 : In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as % can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
8319 : % cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of % can then be embedded.
8320 : The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
8321 : If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
8322 : As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
8323 : You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
8324 : Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
8325 : My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
8326 : The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
8327 : Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
8328 : To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
8329 : When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
8330 : Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
8331 : Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
8332 : As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call fewell. The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
8333 : Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
8334 : To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
8335 : For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
8336 : That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your %! What could be easier?
8337 : Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of %? If so, you've come to the right place!
8338 : We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
8339 : Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
8340 : Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
8341 : Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
8342 : My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
8343 : Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
8344 : Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
8345 : Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
8346 : The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
8347 : Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
8348 : Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
8349 : We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
8350 : It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
8351 : Wondering if your % can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
8352 : A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
8353 : Congratulations! Your % can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A %-shaped aperture, to be exact...
8354 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: # / [///////].
8355 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
8356 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
8357 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
8358 : That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
8359 : Hmm... I'm afraid your % cannot house any more apertures.
8360 : ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your % cannot be etched.
8361 : Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your % cannot be etched at this time.
8362 : Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

8365 : View which recipe? ([Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice/Journeyman/Craftsman/Artisan/Adept/Veteran], p. #). None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Return to page selection. Previous page. Next page.
8366 : Oh, the %? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
8367 : Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
8368 : Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
8369 : Learn about synergy? Not today. Teach me! Just give me %.
8370 : A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
8371 : I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
8372 : Using % in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
8373 : What we call % serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
8374 : Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
8375 : Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your % into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
8376 : Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
8377 : Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
8378 : You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
8379 : But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
8380 : A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
8381 : That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
8382 : An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for %, you've certainly come to the right place.
8383 : I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for # gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
8384 : # gil, paid in full!
8385 : As promised, here's your %. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
8386 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
8387 : Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
8388 : Press confirm to proceed.
8390 : O...i...!
8391 : C'mon now, open yer eyes!
8392 : Ye all right, [mate/lass]? Gave me a right fright, crumplin' to the ground without warnin' as ye did.
8393 : Eh? A pink flash of light in the sky, ye say?
8394 : Took a knock on the ol' noggin when ye fell, most like. No one from 'round here's seen anythin' of the sort.
8395 : What're ye called, if I might ask?
8396 : %, eh? Me name's Joachim, an' the fact ye remember yer own means yer wits're intact, I'd say.
8397 : %.
8398 : What ye witnessed jus' now was no trick of the mind, but as real a thing as the folk in this bustlin' port.
8399 : Ye saw what ye did 'cause ye've got potential. Aye, that ye do. But whether this potential'll serve ye good or ill's not somethin' I can say.
8400 : Remember what I jus' told ye, though. An' if ye ever start wantin' answers, come an' seek me out.
8401 : Sorry, [mate/lass], but would ye mind leavin' me in peace?
8402 : CHECK
8403 : ERROR
8405 : Well, if it isn't %. I knew ye'd come seekin' answers sooner or later.
8406 : So ye be wantin' t' know 'bout the strange flash of light ye saw...
8407 : I'm not one fer beatin' 'round the bush, so I'll say it straight. What ye witnessed was a phenomenon called noise--the irregular brushin' of one dimension against another. Ordinary folk don't see such things, mind ye. So I s'pose that makes ye extra-ordinary.
8408 : Me theory's that ye've got a natural attunement t' the phasic alignment of our dimensions. That be the potential I spoke of when I found ye sprawled on the ground.
8409 : ...
8410 : Ye look a bit out o' sorts, an' I don't blame ye. The truth can be a bitter draught t' swallow, I know.
8411 : I'd love nothin' more than to say this is jus' some hearth tale, I would. We'd all be happier that way, t' be sure. But what's an adventurer if [he/she] turns [his/her] back t' reality?
8412 : Now, this isn't t' say that I take ye fer a faithless type, but I've got a feelin' that simple words won't do. Some things a [man/woman]'s jus' got t' see with [his/her] own two eyes.
8413 : So I want ye to have this.
8414 : It's %.
8415 : If ye've truly got the potential I marked ye fer, that stone there'll guide ye on yer way. Take it with ye an' pay a visit t' one of them cavernous maws.
8416 : Ye know of those ghastly things, aye?
8417 : Mind ye, the ones that're frozen like stiffs won't serve.
8418 : La Theine Plateau, Konschtat Highlands, Tahrongi Canyon...
8419 : Jugner Forest, Valkurm Dunes, Buburimu Peninsula...
8420 : Xarcabard, North Gustaberg, South Gustaberg...
8421 : There be maws in these areas what've been freed from their inanimate state. What be the reason fer this, though, yer coin's as good as mine.
8422 : Now that ye know where the answer awaits, the rest is in yer hands.
8423 : But I leave ye with a word of warnin'. Seek the truth with frivolous intent, and it'll cost ye yer life.
8424 : That's no idle threat, but simply the way it is.
8425 : Never ye be forgettin' my words.
8426 : Well met, %. Anythin' I can help ye with?
8427 : What do you want to know? I want %. About the cavernous maws. Nothing.
8428 : Nothin' I can do? I'll be right here if ye change yer mind.
8429 : The maws tickle yer fancy, eh?
8430 : These [zero/three/six/nine] areas're where ye'll find the thawed maws.
8431 : All in good time, [mate/lass]. Whether yer potential's equal the %'s worth remains t' be seen. One should be more than enough fer the nonce.
8432 : Me apologies, [mate/lass].
8433 : I could've jus' told ye everythin', but there's naught quite like havin' cold, hard reality shoved in yer face.
8434 : Ye've got a quick head restin' on yer shoulders, so no doubt ye've already pieced it together. I'm not of this world, but a visitor come from the plane ye've jus' paid visit to. Abyssea, we call it.
8435 : Havin' now seen it with yer own two eyes, it's needless t' tell ye the shoddy state Abyssea's in. Without so much as a howl of warnin', we were overrun by fell creatures that'd put nightmares t' shame. Whole nations were reduced t' piles of rubble.
8436 : The once-blue sky turned a blood-red, an' the saviors we'd prayed fer were all felled, one after the other. Those that weren't taken in the first wave of destruction were left t' live in despair, cowerin' in fear if so much as a shadow flickered past.
8437 : I know full well I've no right to ask this of ye, but I must. Please help us. We've got no hope left save what we can find in brave souls such as ye.
8438 : I beg ye, be the glimmer of hope me folk an' I so badly need...
8439 : Be their glimmer of hope? You betcha! Uhrrrm...all right.
8440 : Y-ye've no idea what this means to us, %! We're forever in yer debt.
8441 : To help ye help us, it'll be me pleasure t' share all I know.
8442 : To recap what I've already told ye, the cavernous maws are portals to Abyssea. But the door won't open unless ye've got one of them %.
8443 : That's not their only purpose, mind ye.
8444 : Besides bein' keys, they also serve as anchors what secure yer essence t' foreign dimensions. In simpler terms, they allow you t' stay within Abyssea, though not indefinitely.
8445 : One's good fer a #-minute stay (Earth time), and # of them is the most ye can hold at once. Do the math, and ye'll get the longest stretch of time folk of yer world can stay in Abyssea.
8446 : Now, what I'm about t' tell ye is deathly crucial, so take it t' heart. Stay anchored in another dimension overlong, an' what was temporary will become permanent. In other words, ye risk losin' fer good the means t' return home.
8447 : A bunch of me mates an' I are livin', walkin' proof of such a tragedy.
8448 : But ye can rest assured, fer % these days are worked with a safety measure. At the first sign of trouble it'll catapult ye back home safe an' sound.
8449 : Well, that's jus' about the beef of it. Come see me whenever ye want %, aye? I might not always have one on hand, though, as it takes a bloody long time--twenty hours, t 'be precise (Earth time)--t' infuse one with energy. Any less an' they're about as useful as skippin' stones.
8450 : Ah, %. Good t' lay eyes, [mate/lass].
8451 : What would like to ask about? I want %. Learn about %. Current % stock. Cavernous maw locations. Teleporting to a cavernous maw. Nothing right now.
8452 : Nothin' ye need? Ye jus' let Joachim here know if ever ye need more %, aye?
8453 : The maws tickle yer fancy, eh?
8454 : Make sure ye've got enough % b'fore ye go divin' into maws.
8455 : % aren't jus' keys t' open the portal t' Abyssea.
8456 : They also serve as anchors what secure yer essence t' foreign dimensions.
8457 : In other words, they allow you t' stay within Abyssea, though not indefinitely.
8458 : Ye be wantin' another %? Let me jus' quickly check what I've got in store.
8459 : Eh? Looks like ye've already got yerself # of them. Sorry, [mate/lass], but no sane [man/woman] ought have more, lest [he/she] risk gettin' [hisself/herself] stranded in Abyssea.
8460 : Ah, sorry, [mate/lass], but I've got nothin' fully charged right now. Check back in a wee while, would ye?
8461 : Here ye go, [mate/lass]. That should be enough fer now.
8462 : I see ye've hooked yerself up with some cruor. In case ye didn't already know, these red granules first appeared when the cataclysm befell Abyssea.
8463 : We've yet t' uncover the mystery of this strange mineral--what the hell it is, fer instance--but thanks t' its gem-like appearance, folk quickly adopted it as currency in Abyssea.
8464 : That's not the only reason fer its meteoric rise t' prominence, mind ye. Cruor's a highly condensed source of energy, ye see, an' has already found application in various facets of post-apocalyptic life.
8465 : Martellos, veridical confluxes...all these things depend on cruor fer power. Can't imagine gil bein' half as useful, can ye?
8466 : But that ain't all. By unleashin' the power of cruor, you can now instantaneously travel from here t' cavernous maws what serve as gateways t' Abyssea. Ye jus' need t' have been there once b'fore.
8467 : Is there nothin' these little red buggers can't do? I, fer one, am beginnin' t' think not.
8468 : If ye've a mind to teleport somewhere, jus' speak with Horst beside me here. He'll take good care of ye.
8469 : It'll take me # more [minute/minutes] t' fully charge another % (Earth time).
8470 : Ye want t' know how many % ye've got to yer name? That'd be #, [mate/lass].
8471 : Obtained key item: # %!
8472 : Obtained key item: # %!
8473 : %. I've been told ye met some mates of mine.
8474 : Ye ought t' know now how starved of hope me folk are, livin' each day not knowin' if it'd be the last.
8475 : So far we've managed t' stay in the fight, puttin' up protective wards an' pitchin' warmachines into the fray, but they're temporary measures at best.
8476 : The Abyssean hordes continue to grow, an' not a day goes by without us losin' ground t' them.
8477 : Fer too long we've been forced onto our back foot. If we're t' have any hope of survival, we need t' go on the offensive.
8478 : But fer this we need yer aid.
8479 : I beg ye, %! Help us turn the tide of battle in our favor!
8480 : %! I couldn't believe me ears when first I heard the news!
8481 : Yer exploits against the Abyssean hordes've allowed us t' escape the rut we're in. Fer once I find meself thankin' the gods fer strandin' me in this world.
8482 : With yer help, there's hope yet fer Abyssea. Why, there're even some as say it might be restored to its former glory!
8483 : I meself am not one fer countin' eggs afore they're hatched, but one thing's fer certain:
8484 : The seed of hope has sprouted!
8485 : A seedling it is still, but lit with determination and watered with perseverance, into a great, towerin' oak it'll surely grow!
8486 : A long road stretches far ahead of us...
8487 : But with yer help, %, we'll follow it one step at a time...'til the day we reach its end!
8488 : Ah, there ye are, %. I was wonderin' when next ye'd turn up.
8489 : There be somethin' I need t' ask of ye. Well, t' be precise, there be someone I'd like ye t' meet.
8490 : Due t' reasons beyond our control, the man can't be here. So instead he'll be waitin' for ye at the stone circle in the La Theine Plateau. I trust a veteran adventurer such as yerself knows how t' navigate [himself/herself] there.
8491 : Truly sorry fer this sudden request, but circumstances won't allow fer a meetin' t' take place here. I'd explain the reason why, except I'm sworn t' silence on this.
8492 : Go meet the mystery man? Oooh, I love mysteries! Sounds a little shady...
8493 : I beg fer yer understandin', %. Ye know I'd tell ye all if I could, but this is jus' the way it's gotta be.
8494 : I'm in yer debt yet again, %. Now, as I said, ye'll meet yer man at the stone circle in La Theine. Thing is, due t' the stones' properties, he can't be there fer long stretches of time.
8495 : Only from dusk till dawn can he cross over t' this world. Be keepin' that in mind.
8496 : I don't blame ye if ye're feelin' reserved about meetin' this mystery man, but I assure ye, he's a real dinkum bloke.
8497 : Jus' take yerself over t' the rendezvous point, an' he'll seek ye out. It's simple as meat pie.
8498 : Go well, %. Be seein' ye again real soon.
8499 : Welcome back, %. It seems the meetin' went without incident.
8500 : I trust ye understand now why the man couldn't come t' Jeuno.
8501 : Bein' an underworld figure of sorts, it wouldn't do if he were seen paradin' himself hereabouts.
8502 : Doubtless he's already bent yer ears 'bout havin' been a pirate back in the day, runnin' his operations out of Elshimo.
8503 : Considerin' how well-traveled an adventurer ye are, I reckon ye already knew the man.
8504 : But I won't probe ye on that subject. Some things are best left untouched, t' be sure.
8505 : I find meself sayin' this often of late, but yer aid has allowed hope t' sprout among the survivors. If ye were t' ask me if mankind's made any real progress, though, the answer would be a resoundin' no.
8506 : The survivors're more organized than afore, true, but our fundamental plight be as grim as ever. The Abyssean hordes attack, an' we beat them back as best we can. An' when we're not busy fendin' off monsters, we're scrapin' up what livin' we can, foragin' fer food what can still be had.
8507 : None of this has changed, %, an' I suspect that be why ye were called out t' La Theine. Rumors of yer feats aren't like t' escape the notice of key resistance folk fer long. Soon or late, they'd look ye up, hopin' t' recruit yer aid in gettin' us out of this rut.
8508 : Hit the nail fair on the head, did I? I'm not the only one who sees great things in ye, %, an' fer good reason.
8509 : Me comrades an' I crossed over t' this world, desperately searchin' fer a way t' save our home.
8510 : An' in the midst o' our despair, we found our ray of hope in strong, compassionate folk such as yerself.
8511 : Uncoverin' the truth an' restorin' Abyssea t' its erstwhile state--these things've proven t' be far beyond the power of me folk t' accomplish alone.
8512 : I beg ye, %, please keep lendin' us yer strength! Stand with us t' the bloody end!
8513 : How will you respond? If you need a hero, look no further! It's just too big a commitment.
8514 : Words alone aren't enough t' express me gratitude, %.  With yer help, Abyssea will surely again be restored t' the beauteous realm she once was.
8515 : I know I ask much of ye, %, an' fer that I'm sorry. We'd still appreciate yer aid, though, in whatever quantity ye can offer. Please jus' don't turn yer back on us.
8516 : Ah, %. Always a sight fer sore eyes. I've got a message fer ye here, from ye-know-who. Needs t' speak with ye again, he says.
8517 : The location's the same, out at the stone circle in La Theine. As fer the time, remember what I told ye earlier.
8518 : While I'm not privy t' the purpose of this next meetin', I know the man wouldn't cross over here fer whimsical reasons.
8519 : That he'd come again so soon doesn't bode well, I fear...
8520 : The meetin' went all right, [mate/lass]?
8521 : Aye, the old man's certainly fond o' talkin'. Mind ye don't go divulgin' the conversation t' me or the others, though.
8522 : Were it somethin' meant fer our ears, we would've already heard about it.
8523 : Certain things are confidential fer a reason, I think ye'll agree.
8524 : I'd be a great big liar if I said I wasn't at all curious. On the other hand, though, I fear what learnin' the truth might be liable t' do t' me sanity.
8525 : Countless unbelievable things've come t' pass since that fateful day.
8526 : Afore the cataclysm, any talk of dimensional travel would've been met with ridicule.
8527 : Lookin' back, we were all happier then, blissful in our ignorance.
8528 : Wakin' up one day, suddenly findin' meself capable o' traversin' dimensions...that was a bloody huge shock, I tell ye. But I digress...
8529 : Gilgamesh claims not t' possess full knowledge of things, but it's clear enough he's better informed than most.
8530 : I've got a hunch that be part of the reason why he specifically picked ye out. I won't badger ye fer the details, though.
8531 : I've got me own job t' do, an' I mean t' do it well. I must continue recruitin' strong adventurers t' aid our plight.
8532 : And ye, %. Me comrades an' I hope we can keep relyin' on yer trusty sword arm.
8533 : I trust yer journeys in Abyssea've introduced ye t' the defensive structures we call martellos.
8534 : The ones garrisoned in Vunkerl, Attohwa, and Misareaux are earlier models what need t' have their power augmented from a central location. An outpost has been established in each area especially fer this purpose.
8535 : However, the Abyssean fiends've somehow caught wind of the outposts' true nature. Since then they've been hell-bent on tearin' them t' the ground.
8536 : If an outpost were t' fall, the effectiveness of all martellos in the area'd be gravely compromised. Suffice it t' say, that'd be right disastrous fer the resistance effort.
8537 : I realize ye're already doin' much fer us, but the outposts sorely lack fer defenders. I'd volunteer meself fer the job, weren't I stuck here in Vana'diel.
8538 : I beseech ye, %, help us t' defend the outposts! Think of it as doin' a personal favor fer me!
8539 : Ye never cease t' amaze me, %. Why, not only did ye shine in yer defense of the outposts, ye even managed t' slay those vicious fiends what've wreaked havoc upon us fer so long.
8540 : Words can't express how glad I am t' have ye fightin' on our side.
8541 : Ah, what I wouldn't give t' possess even half yer strength--t' be able t' do somethin' fer me own folk. But...there's somethin' I mus' confess.
8542 : A part of me's grateful fer bein' stranded here. Thankful that I never again have t' set foot upon that hell on earth. That I think such cowardly thoughts...it racks me with guilt, %.
8543 : Ye...ye understand how I feel, ye say?
8544 : Ye truly are a kindhearted soul. It's a rare [man/woman] who possesses both strength an' compassion in abundance like ye.
8545 : Please forgive me fer that unseemly display. The pressures of me world's plight can be overwhelmin' at times.
8546 : %. I pray ye never cease t' be the ray of hope fer the folk of Abyssea.
8547 : Oh, my... Such a pristine, untainted world...
8548 : Greetings, friend. Delighted to finally meet you. My name is Horst, and I have the utmost pleasure of being Joachim's assistant.
8549 : I also derive much pleasure from assisting the brave, selfless souls who have made our cause their own.
8550 : If there is anything you wish to know regarding Abyssea, it would delight me so to share my knowledge with you.
8551 : What would you like to ask about? My current cruor balance. Resistance outpost status. Teleporting to a cavernous maw. Nothing right now.
8552 : According to my logbook--which is kept to the highest standards--you have # cruor in your possession.
8553 : Ask about which area? Abyssea - Vunkerl. Abyssea - Misareaux. Abyssea - Attohwa. Never mind.
8554 : According to the latest intelligence reports...
8555 : This area's pulse martello defense rate presently stands at #%. The likelihood of an Abyssean horde invasion, on the other hand, is #%.
8556 : You'd like to teleport to a cavernous maw? Through the power of the little red pretties we call cruor, I shall be overjoyed to assist you!
8557 : Go to which area's gateway? Abyssea - La Theine. Abyssea - Konschtat. Abyssea - Tahrongi. Abyssea - Vunkerl. Abyssea - Misareaux. Abyssea - Attohwa. Abyssea - Altepa. Abyssea - Uleguerand. Abyssea - Grauberg. I've changed my mind.
8558 : # cruor is required to teleport to the gateway to Abyssea - [La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Uleguerand/Grauberg].
8559 : Oh, my, it seems you don't have enough cruor.
8560 : Will you proceed? (Cruor balance: #) Make it so. Make it no.
8561 : These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes. Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.
8562 : I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.
8563 : I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos. Would you be needing something of me?
8564 : Need something? Assist with replenishment. Assist with upgrades. Martellos? Come again? Nothing in particular.
8565 : Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort. To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these % into the structure.
8566 : Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and % at the same time.
8567 : Take along the %? Yes. No.
8568 : We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations. Best of luck in your efforts!
8569 : Why, is that not % already in your posssesion? You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.
8570 : I see that you currently possess %. Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?
8571 : You return the % and obtain % in its stead!
8572 : Your support is most heartening in these dark times. Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as %.
8573 : Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy. You will not be able to carry it and % at the same time.
8574 : Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better. Be careful out there!
8575 : Hm? Is that not % you hold in your hand? You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.
8576 : Is that % I see? Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?
8577 : Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that % off your hands. How did you fare in your efforts?
8578 : I see, I see... Martello #0#, you say? It sounds as if the operation was [a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]
8579 : The resistance greatly values your contributions. Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.
8580 : I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high. Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.
8581 : Ask something? So, what's a martello? Martello replenishment. Martello upgrades. Cautionary notes. Not now.
8582 : The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war. Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.
8583 : You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.
8584 : In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.
8585 : This % is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers. Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.
8586 : That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.
8587 : I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel. Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word. Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.
8588 : Feast your eyes on this %. She's a beauty, isn't she? Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.
8589 : An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations. Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.
8590 : Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex. As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.
8591 : % are quite large and unwieldy. Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and % at the same time.
8592 : Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.
8593 : 'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...
8594 : Warning: Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
8595 : Your % has been lost.
8596 : The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage. Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.
8597 : The % breaks!
8598 : Table: #
8599 : Grauberg, Altepa Desert, Uleguerand Range...
8600 : The monsters what prowl these three areas in Abyssea are right frightful, I tell ye. Why, the ones ye've dealt with so far would seem as tame kittens beside 'em.
8601 : But that ain't the half of it, [mate/lass]. Even if ye took away the threat of nasty beasties, Altepa an' Uleguerand are in an' of themselves perilous places.
8602 : These two locales represent some of the world's harshest environments, utterly ill-suited fer sustainin' life.
8603 : We gotta make haste an' pave an evacuation route fer the survivors, else they won't be in the survivin' business fer much longer.
8604 : The casualties are mountin' even as we speak, %, folk dyin' of exposure, starvation, simple maladies...
8605 : I know we've played out this scene upwards of a dozen times...but I mus' ask fer yer help yet again.
8606 : I beg ye, %! Please do what ye can fer the embattled folk of Abyssea!
8607 : By the heavens, %! Ye truly did it...ye did fer that detestable menace! Is there no limit t' yer potential, [mate/lass]?
8608 : When word of yer amazin' deed reached me ears, me whole body fair trembled with excitement. With a staunch comrade such as ye fightin' beside us, there's nothin' me folk and I need fear.
8609 : Now, I'm not so naive as t' celebrate prematurely. I know full well it'll take much time an' effort yet afore our former lives are restored.
8610 : But we've managed t' cast off the shackles of despair, a right momentous first step.
8611 : The situation's taken a turn fer the better all across the land, an' we owe it all t' ye, %. I honestly don't know where we'd be without ye.
8612 : From what vile loins were the Abyssean hordes spawned? And why did the sky take on a bloody red? Questions such as these remain unanswered, t' be sure.
8613 : But with the aid of ye an' yers, we're gettin' closer an' closer t' uncoverin' the truth.
8614 : Ah, don't be takin' me comment the wrong way, [mate/lass]. The help ye've already afforded us verges on immeasurable, an' it's not me intention t' put undue pressure on ye.
8615 : Havin' said that, I hope ye'll stand with us through t' the very end.
8616 : The location's different this time, mind ye. Ye ever heard of the Hall of the Gods, [mate/lass]?
8617 : I'll fill ye in on the directions, jus' fer good measure. T' get there, first leave the Meriphataud Mountains from the northeast. Ye should find yerself standin' in the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah, the gateway way t' the Li'Telor Region.
8618 : Make yer way north through the coniferous forest, an ye'll wind up in the sprawlin' ruins of Ro'Maeve. Proceed further on in, an' ye'll eventually come upon the Hall of the Gods.
8619 : In olden times, the place was said t' be the destination fer many a pilgrim. Nowadays, though, ye're more like t' bump into spirits. There's nary a better place fer hush-hush dealings, I reckon.
8620 : As I explained afore, the man can only step over t' this side fer short durations. Aye, fer him t' pick such an isolated meetin' location tells me something's afoot.
8621 : As fer the time, remember what I told ye earlier.
8622 : From what I know, ye can get as far as Ro'Maeve on chocoboback, though the poor beasts balk at enterin' the ruins. A teleport spell would also help quicken the journey a deal.
8623 : Now, this is probably needless of me t' say, %, but be careful out there, eh?
8624 : Time and place're the same as afore, the Hall of the Gods deep within Ro'Maeve.
8625 : What's that, [mate/lass]? It bothers ye that I don't seem even the slightest bit curious, ye say?
8626 : T' be fair, I've been made privy t' bits an' pieces. As a matter of fact, the chance was dangled in front of me t' learn the whole truth.
8627 : Thing is, I wasn't able t' muster up the courage t' reach out fer it. Shied away at the last moment.
8628 : There be things better left in the shadows, matey, that ol' sea dog said.
8629 : An' so I resolved t' stay ignorant in me bliss fer a while longer, an' have been keepin' me peace.
8630 : Given a bit of time, though, the day'll come when I'm ready t' face the truth of things.
8631 : In anywise, ye best be goin' now, %. Else me ramblin' is never like t' end.
8632 : %, a moment.
8633 : I heard ye did fer those dreadful caturae creatures. As it happens, we discovered somethin' of interest. All the juicy details, ye can get from ye-know-who.
8634 : There's one more thing. I...finally found out. About everythin'.
8635 : It was so...fantastical. Every word so far beyond the realm of logic, I was struck dumb. But then again, how else could ye explain the cause fer the devastation what's befallen Abyssea?
8636 : I'm told ye've got a mind t' go it against a divinity, %. I can't help but scratch me head at why ye'd do so much fer a world that isn't even yer own.
8637 : It's been botherin' me, %. Won't ye tell me what drives ye, [mate/lass]?
8638 : Why do you fight for Abyssea? I'm an adventurer! Just because!
8639 : Ye fight because ye're...an adventurer? I've always thought ye lot were strange, but yer reply pretty much sets me sentiments in stone.
8640 : Just because, ye say? I'd like t' think folk'd have a good reason t' defy the will of a god, but I s'pose not.
8641 : There're many mysteries in the world, an' ye adventurers are definitely one of 'em.
8642 : % grins knowingly at Joachim.
8643 : That grin ye wear speaks volumes, [mate/lass]. Aye, that it does.
8644 : A right mysterious bunch they were, as many an' unique as the fishes in the sea, arggg, the old man would oft say...again an' again till me ears fair bled. Might be the world's changed beyond recognition, but it's reassurin' t' know some things'll always stay the same.
8645 : Sorry once again, %, fer holdin' ye up. It's become a terrible habit of mine. I jus' want ye t' know I appreciate these little conversations we have.
8646 : There's somethin' I've been meanin' t' give ye.
8647 : %.
8648 : It's a memento of me home, somethin' I haven't been able t' let go of till now. I'm entrustin' it t' ye, [mate/lass], as a token of me faith in ye.
8649 : Me faith that ye'll do right by the folk of Abyssea.
8650 : Is that right... So it'll be a while yet afore lives return t' normal. T' be sure, it'd be naive t' believe all the damage what Abyssea sustained could be undone overnight.
8651 : Deep down, though, I allowed meself t' hope. I'd be lyin' through me teeth if I said I weren't disappointed.
8652 : Regardless, I take great joy in knowin' that mankind is saved. An' that me mates an' I, our comin' an' bein' stranded here wasn't in vain.
8653 : I want t' thank ye again, %--both ye an' yers--from the bottom o' me heart. A more courageous, valiant crew I've never known!
8654 : By the bye, I've got here another message fer ye, from the usual suspects.
8655 : They want t' see ye soon as ye got back, [mate/lass]. Said they'll be waitin' at the same time, same place.
8656 : Ye know the deal, aye?
8657 : Do you know the deal? How could I ever forget? Tell me again, just in case.
8658 : The details escaped yer mind, did they? Well, small wonder, considerin' the excitement of recent days. The Hall of the Gods, deep within Ro'Maeve, is where ye want t' go, [mate/lass].
8659 : %, a moment.
8660 : It jus' crossed me mind, but what will ye do now that Abyssea's saved from her fate of certain destruction?
8661 : What will you do? Go fulfill a promise.
8662 : A promise? Ye mean the one ye made t' that girl ye jus' mentioned?
8663 : At any rate... You can leave Abyssea to me! Have the % ready!
8664 : Hahaha! I will, [mate/lass], don't ye worry yer head off 'bout it. I guarantee ye, I'll be here t' assist ye any way I know how...till the day me flesh an' bones turn t' dust!
8665 : Very well, friend. Should you ever find yourself desiring to know more of Abyssea, do not hesitate to return.
8666 : Obtain which item? None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
8667 : Are you certain?
8668 : Obtain the %? Yes. No.
8669 : The chest is empty.
8670 : The Abyssea and Atma Axtravaganza is in full swing! Just open this chest to claim your prize.
8671 : You can claim it anytime you want during the campaign, but don't wait too long. You can't claim squat after the campaign ends.
8672 : Anyway, do you want your Abyssea and Atma Axtravaganza gifts or not?
8673 : Receive the gifts? Of course! No thanks.
8674 : Gift 1: Eleven different types of atma. *Characters who already possess the specified atma will not receive all eleven.
8675 : Gift 2: One %! *Characters who already possess all three will be given 100,000 cruor.
8676 : Gift 3: 100,000 cruor!
8677 : Gift 4: The ability to store 100 more traverser stones! *You may check your stock of stones by speaking with Joachim or other applicable Abyssean personages.
8678 : Your traverser stone stock has increased by 100!
8679 : Now that you have all the gifts, it's time to put them to use in Abyssea!
8680 : You're able to claim these amazing Abyssean gifts, so go talk to Joachim in Port Jeuno (H-8) before it's too late.
8681 : The Abyssea and Atma Axtravaganza event has concluded.
8682 : I've been charged with looking after the equipment of heroes and heroines past.
8683 : I'll even let you have one...if you bring me three pieces of unneeded footwear.
8684 : What do you want?
8685 : What do you want? Nothing. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
8686 : Are you fine with this?
8687 : Well, are you? Yes. No.
8688 : Our fam'ly peddle sky flowers. You want have nice scenery? Send fireworks sky high! It's great feeling. Bwee hee hee.
8689 : Kindlix's fireworks? No good. You want have nice scenery? Mine are best. C'mon, c'mon, have look. Which you like?
8690 : Pyropox, that's my cus'mer!
8691 : Pyropox be my twin sis'er, but she swindle you--not like me. We very much diff'rent.
8692 : Bwee hee. I get fireworks from all 'round globe. Kindlix never sell more than me.
8693 : Pyropox have connections I don't. But my goods, they...good. How 'bout you have look?
8694 : Kindlix! No steal my cus'mer!
8695 : Steal cus'mer, die thousand deaths. That just how our fam'ly do.
8696 : Hail, soldier. I am a purveyor tasked with furnishing the brave men and women of the Voidwatch with essential supplies. My wares can be yours, provided you've got [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes] to trade. After all, we can't afford to let our limited resources go to waste in the hands of some unproven rookie.
8697 : Procure supplies? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Not now. % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#).
8698 : How many? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: #) None, actually. One (Cost: #). Three (Cost: #), Six (Cost: #). Nine (Cost: #). Twelve (Cost: #).
8699 : This % will cost you # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
8700 : It seems you're short on [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing credits/Allied Notes], soldier. Come back when you've got a bit more seasoning under your belt.
8701 : Proceed? (Required [Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Yes. No.
8702 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
8703 : % obtains # % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
8704 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
8705 : This % will cost you # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
8706 : You already have %, and I'm not authorized to furnish you with another. Resources are in short supply. You'll have to make do with what you've already got.
8715 : How many? ( [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes]: #)
8716 : You may purchase up to # at a time.
8717 : (Psst, you. Yeah, you! You look like a [guy/gal] who can't get enough crests and seals. Am I right?)
8718 : Crests and seals? Gimme more more more! I've got enough.
8719 : That's what I'm talkin' about! Now listen up, 'cause have I ever got a deal for you.
8720 : Now that's what I'm talkin' ab...hm? Whaddaya mean you've got enough? Way to ruin my sales pitch, [buddy/lady]. Just be quiet and listen, will ya?
8721 : You can call me Shemo. I'm Shami's brother. (And just between you and me, I'm the brains behind this operation.)
8722 : Here's the deal. Is my big bro holdin' onto any old crests or seals that ya don't need? Well, I can offer you one shiny new seal--any seal--of your choice for # of yours.
8723 : Whaddaya think of that?
8724 : Hm? Why three, ya ask? Hey, a trader's gotta turn a profit somehow, right?
8725 : So, how you doin' on seals and crests these days? If you want to make a trade, Shemo's got ya covered. Just say the word.
8726 : Make a trade? Let's do it. Not today. Wait, how does this work?
8727 : Hmph. And here I thought you were a [guy/gal] who knew a good deal when ya saw one. Fine, we didn't need your business anyway.
8728 : That's what I'm talkin' about! I knew you had an eye for business. So what seals are ya lookin' to get rid of today?
8729 : Trade away which seals? None. % (You have #). % (You have #). % (You have #). % (You have #). % (You have #).
8730 : You're gonna give me %, yeah? Got it. Now whaddaya want in return?
8731 : Obtain which seal(s)? None. % (You have #). % (You have #). % (You have #). % (You have #). % (You have #).
8732 : You currently have a balance of # ) and # %. Enter the number of % you wish to obtain: (Maximum: #).
8733 : I'll be takin' # ) off your hands to give as many % as ya asked for. We still have a deal?
8734 : That's what I'm sayin'! Another suck--ahem. Another satisfied customer!
8735 : That brings your total balance to # % and # %. How do ya like that!?
8736 : What's that? %? Yeah, I can hold onto those for ya.
8737 : That brings your total balance of % to #. If you're lookin' to make a trade, just talk to your buddy Shemo here.
8738 : Got a bunch of 'em, do ya? Lemme have a look-see.
8739 : Shami's holding a total of...
8740 : # %.
8741 : Should be all. Lemme know if y'need anything else.
8742 : By the way, I can store seals and crests for ya, too. Shami and I, we work together, y'see.
8743 : Don't worry, I won't be skimmin' nothin' off the top. Not with a good customer like you, at least. Heh heh heh.
8744 : Whoa there, now! Our Gobbiebags can't hold every seal in the realm, ya know. You're gonna have to make a trade or purchase before ya give us any more.
8745 : (Psst! You're an adventurer, aren't ya? If you've got any beastmen's seals, Kindred's crests, or what-have-ya, you'll want to trade 'em to me or my brother here. Trust me. We'll make it worth your while.)
8746 : Hey, you tryin' to pull a fast one on me? You've only got # %.
8747 : Wait a minute. That couldn't be...but it is! Yes, that's % if I've ever seen one!
8748 : But you don't even know what it is, do you? Clearly not, the way it's stuffed willy-nilly in your Gobbiebag like a fistful of batagreens!
8749 : You should thank the Goddess that you ran into Shami today, my friend! Because if there's one thing Shami knows, Shami knows value!
8750 : Here's what Shami can do for you. I'll kindly take that curio off your hands and give you something equally impressive, but far more practical for an adventurer like yourself!
8751 : And if you've got anything similar to that %, I'll trade for that as well!
8752 : I've traveled far and wide tracking down the most extraordinary treasures from the shiftiest, shadiest traders in the realm so you don't have to! Just trade me the goods, and these riches can be yours!
8753 : You cannot carry any more items. Make the trade again after sorting your inventory.
8754 : Wonderful! There's a suck-- Er, a satisfied customer born every minute!
8755 : Now you know where the best deals in the Duchy are! So don't hesitate to come back, you hear?
8756 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
8757 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
8758 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
8759 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
8760 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
8761 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
8762 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
8763 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
8764 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
8765 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
8766 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
8767 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
8768 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
8769 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
8770 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
8771 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
8772 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
8773 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
8774 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
8775 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
8776 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
8777 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
8778 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
8779 : Deal, kupo? (Current gil: #). Check storable items. Deal. No deal.

8792 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
8793 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
8794 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
8795 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
8796 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
8797 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.
8798 : Why, it looks as if you have % located in your [inventory/Mog Safe/Mog Safe 2/Mog House storage/Mog Locker/Mog Satchel/Mog Sack/Mog Case/Mog Wardrobe/Mog Wardrobe 2/Mog Wardrobe 3/Mog Wardrobe 4/Mog Wardrobe 5/Mog Wardrobe 6/Mog Wardrobe 7/Mog Wardrobe 8/Recycle Bin]!

8808 : Hm, I could have sworn that inscrutable aura was emanating from you, but I suppose I was mistaken. Feel free to exit my line of sight at any time, plebeian.
8809 : What curious ordnance you carry. My hairs are standing on end just from being in its proximity.
8810 : Oboro took your % without even asking!
8811 : Ahhh... Ohhh... What a positively breathtaking artifact. Now I have something else to absorb myself in other than the masterful teachings of Borghertz.
8812 : My apologies, [sir/madam]. Gazing upon the intricacies of well-crafted blades and staves is a truly mesmerizing experience, and I often lose myself between their individual grains and grooves. At any rate, social custom dictates that I return this to you.
8813 : The uncouth Hume begrudgingly hands over your %.
8814 : Yes, it would certainly do you well to know my name. I go by Oboro, and as a blacksmith from the Far East, I contrive exquisite instruments of assault almost from thin air.
8815 : While I am undoubtedly the most accomplished smith in my homeland, I am not an arrogant Elvaan. I have heard the rumors of Borghertz's greatness and have come to broaden my horizons under his wing.
8816 : Know you of Borghertz, the legendary blacksmith revered throughout the Far East?
8817 : Do you know Borghertz? In fact, I do...or did. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
8818 : What!? He has passed on and hammers away happily upon the big anvil in the sky!?
8819 : Of course someone of your inferior stature would not. That is all well and good, however, for we are not all destined for greatness.
8820 : Oh well, let us not dwell on extraneous and repugnant details. Now that I have seen the almighty armament you carry...
8821 : I would have you bequeath it to me.
8822 : If Borghertz is not available to perform this most ambitious of tasks, then I will gladly accept the challenge of eking out every last iota of might from your weapon.
8823 : I cannot tell a lie. I will stake my illustrious career and own life on this claim.
8824 : So, what say you?
8825 : What say you? Fine, have my weapon. You're a jerk and I hate you.
8826 : Hmph. Well, such is your loss. You will simply be unable to defend this city once the apocalypse descends upon it--which will happen sooner than you think.
8827 : Ah, it pleases me to know that you possess the intuition of a true combatant. No one would refuse the opportunity to increase the potency of the tool by which they make their living.
8828 : I would like nothing more than to start remolding this exquisite creation immediately, but I must first say that I cannot and will not work with anything less than the best. Consider the weapon you possess and bring me weapons that meet or exceed its power.
8829 : And let us suppose you actually procure what I ask of you. Will you even be able to grasp the degree to which your life will change, all thanks to my expertise? Heh heh heh, I can hardly wait.
8830 : Why the long face? Did you wet yourself at the thought of losing your closest companion? No worries, I shall be waiting in this very spot when your trousers dry and your resolve hardens.
8831 : Finally come to your senses and realize that leaving your weapon with me is the best option you have?
8832 : I was unaware that the world was still privy to superlative works of art such as this. So grandiose is its design that one must question whether or not it was fashioned by mortal hands.
8833 : Say nothing of the aura it exudes. I feel as if I am conversing with an old friend simply by gazing upon it. Yes, I will indeed deign to pour my soul into improving this instrument.
8834 : In order to do that, however, I require # %. Have fun getting intimately acquainted with them as well as the beasts from which you must procure them.
8835 : Well, now...if I did not so love hearing the sound of my own voice, I would be at a loss for words. To think that I would one day come across one of the Myriad Arms of Balrahn...
8836 : I knew it was my destiny to lay eyes upon one when I first glanced at that ledger of arcane valuables. It seems there was a purpose in coming to this backwoods province after all.
8837 : I cannot in good conscience turn down the chance to pour my heart and soul into this magnificent creation.
8838 : And to assist me in this divine mission, you will bring me # %. Now be off.
8839 : Egads, I thought these were merely legend... Perhaps I should give those floating furballs a tad more credit.
8840 : How do I improve upon perfection? Hmmm, this will prove to be quite the challenge, but overcoming it will surely prove my incomparable talents to the world.
8841 : Now shoo and fetch me # % posthaste if you wish to see my efforts succeed.
8842 : I told you already, # %. Where can I find them? Do I look like I have lived here the entirety of my existence? Find them yourself!
8843 : I would thank you for handing over your %, but you have only done what is logical for our mutual benefit. More importantly, I can already feel the potential of this great weapon.
8844 : One day is but all I need to work my magic. Feel free to get your hopes up in the meantime, too.
8845 : Here is what I promised you, and nothing less. No need to comment upon the craftsmanship, for I already know it is flawless.
8846 : Prepare your body to shudder with excitement when you see the transformation your partner-in-arms has undergone. Now go about your business like a faithful servant and get me what I need.
8847 : Yes, this is it...this is what you have kept me waiting so long for. All is forgiven, for it is exactly as I pictured it.
8848 : I will need you to wait a day while I set to smithing. No need to turn red with anger. A day is but an instant when compared to your adventuring lifetime.
8849 : What a beautiful piece that Balrahn armament was...but it was not even half as beautiful as its current form. Take it in your hands and steel your bladder against your ensuing amazement.
8850 : I can do nothing until you procure me # %, so make haste to acquire them. In the meantime, I will visualize the shape on which my chef d'oeuvre shall take.
8851 : Ah, your %. Very well, you are of no more use to me. Skedaddle and occupy yourself with some paltry distraction while the adults do the real work.
8852 : It will take approximately one day to perform my wonders upon it, so do not come pulling at my coattails asking, Is it done yet? until then.
8853 : Even I am impressed with the craftsmanship of this piece. I would be jealous of the moogles and their magic...except I know I can create even more stunning ordnance when given the chance. Here it is, in all its new splendid glory.
8854 : I had no idea adventurers possessed so much free time. No matter how many times you ask, it will be ready when it is ready...unless you would rather I hand you a half-finished piece of scrap.
8855 : Of course I could never bring myself to hand back a work in progress. You will wait your full day and you will like it, hear me?
8856 : I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed working with the piece you had the sense to give me, and would not be averse to enhancing any others you may have acquired.
8857 : <Ahem>
8858 : What will you do? Prepare the weapon! Nothing.
8859 : What is it you need from me?
8860 : What do you need from him? To know what the deal is. Nothing.
8861 : ...Hmph. Be that as it may, you will come crawling back for my services sooner or later.
8862 : Oho, was that a figment of my imagination, or did your aura just resonate with mine? Pardon me if it took a moment to realize that someone of such low station as you could possibly hope to pique my interest.
8863 : ...I am sorry if you have been offended by the truth, but you adventurers have given me little reason to reconsider my position. If you cannot handle the sparks that fly from my tongue, perhaps you should invest in a thicker skin before concerning yourself with weapons.
8864 : I grow weary of elucidating obvious information to a clodpoll such as you, but at least your skills with a weapon look to be sharper than your mind.
8865 : A lauded blacksmith like myself can decipher in an instant that your piece is of some merit...some being the operative word.
8866 : No need to get defensive. Yeesh, it is amazing how you were able to survive any battles with a head as hot as that.
8867 : What I was trying to say before I was so rudely interrupted is that even I at times require your assistance. While I may not be able to trust in your brains, I can put a modicum of faith in your brawn.
8868 : As for your reward, it shall be an armament more resilient than anything you have wielded previously. Do you not wish to hold in your hands greatness incarnate--fashioned by the best smithy in the land?
8869 : Do you want said equipment? Do you even have to ask!? Not if you make it.
8870 : I had the utmost confidence that such talk would get you slobbering in anticipation. The best part is that you will not even have to use that pea-sized brain of yours.
8871 : Simply procure me a few materials that have yet to find their way to market and I will lend you my boundless prowess to create a tool of extraordinary puissance.
8872 : You need not even trouble yourself over sums, for they are all divvied up according to weapon.
8873 : As long as you can muster the determination to choose an item, I will tell you the type and number of materials you must amass for me to craft it.
8874 : Designate which you will from the list, which I shall show you henceforth, to begin the adventure.
8875 : Oh, there you are. As it so happens, I <cough> require your assistance <cough>. In return, I--in my infinite magnanimity--am willing to offer you some newly crafted ordnance.
8876 : Think of it...an armament the likes of which has never been seen before, fashioned by a smithy among smithies. How could you not covet so phenomenal a treasure?
8877 : Do you want such a weapon? Without question. It's not worth listening to you.
8878 : The number of materials needed differs depending upon the weapon, a fact which you would do well to keep in mind...though I am to understand the borders of yours are quite small.
8879 : Which do you desire? %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. About the weapons. Go back. None.
8880 : %? Very well, then. For that I require %, %, and %.
8881 : Furthermore, I need # ), ), or ).
8882 : You would do well to remember that I am not some hack who labors in the Metalworks. I require exact numbers if I am to forge a decent piece.
8883 : I am happy to see that you can, at the very least, be a competent beast of burden. Feel free to go into hibernation for a day while I perform tasks that require true sentience.
8884 : I must say that I have certainly outdone myself this time. Enjoy this paragon of martial excellence.
8885 : Ahhh... Ohhh... What a positively breathtaking artifact. So it is indeed true that a journey a day keeps one's skills from wasting away.
8886 : I still consider you a bit of a cur, but I also believe you could make the most of this offer I have regarding that almighty armament you carry. To cut to the quick...
8887 : Oh, look! It's my favorite waste of materials. Back for another... Wait. What is...?
8888 : You proffer your %.
8889 : By Altana!
8890 : Despite all our one-sided dealings, %, I must admit that I have misjudged you. Bring me that which I have remolded for you previously, and I shall see what I can do.
8891 : Ah, a fine piece of work, indeed. But tell me--are you satisfied with it? Truly, truly satisfied?
8892 : Well? I suppose. Not entirely.
8893 : Oho. Your tastes are as non-discerning as ever. But if you're content with eating slop out of a horse trough, then who am I to stop you?
8894 : Hmm... %...
8895 : The perfect catalyst to add a little more oomph to the masterpiece I created for you before.
8896 : Oh, and lest you think it'll be destroyed in the process, let me set your mind at ease--I only need to borrow a little bit of its power.
8897 : Of course, I'll need more than just that--and you'll have to come up with the materials yourself.
8898 : Now, as for that precious implement of destruction, I'll need... # %.
8899 : You know where to find me once you've made the grand leap from sloth into action.
8900 : Back with the goods, eh? Taking into account the # % you've just given me, I'll need # more.
8901 : I've got enough %--now all I'll need is for you to bring the weapon in question.
8902 : That should be all I require. I should have your new armament ready in the next couple days. A master requires time.
8903 : You've given me # % so far. Another # should do the trick for your %.
8904 : If you want to halt the process, that's fine by me--but don't expect me to return any of the materials you've already delivered.
8905 : Really abandon the process? Yes. No.
8906 : You absolutely mean it?
8907 : Are you sure? Definitely. Maybe not.
8908 : What is--this clearly isn't my work!
8909 : But it is intruiging...permit me a closer inspection.
8910 : Fascinating! Fashioned with a technique that I have never seen!
8911 : Heh heh...I could live for ten thousand years and not have seen all the world has to offer.
8912 : Along with what you brought me, I'll also need %.
8913 : An artisan of my caliber should find those two things sufficient.
8914 : The idea of bringing your weapon to even greater heights gets your blood pumping, doesn't it?
8915 : Is your blood pumping? So much that I'm dizzy! Not really.
8916 : That's what a man likes to hear!
8917 : But that same man cannot work without his tools. And in this case, not something you can pick up in a market on the way home.
8918 : I should be able to work a bit of the ol' magic using that % you have.
8919 : I'll need %, %, and %--but don't go around mixing them together willy-nilly, else the whole process will go up in smoke.
8920 : That is to say, you needn't give me all of them at once. Stop by every so often with what you've acquired.
8921 : Back with what I need? Good. I haven't yet used the %. If I do, I won't be able to use any of the others. Ready?
8922 : Really use the %? You bet! I need time to think.
8923 : Hmmm... This piece might be a little bit better than the last time, but I bet I could get it to shine even brighter. Stop by later if you're interested.
8924 : Hmmm... Everything has its limits, and this piece is no exception. I've done all I can.
8925 : Let me return your materials.
8926 : Ha! It's as I've always said--a more competent smith you'll find nowhere else!
8927 : Go ahead--give it a swing!
8928 : Yes? Is there something you need?
8929 : What do you want to know about? Show me the list. Upgrading my equipment even further. Equipment from the shrouded world. Never mind.
8930 : Hm...? That % you're holding... Let me see it.
8931 : You showed Oboro the %.
8932 : Yes...yes, indeed... I just might be able to... Oh, forgive me.
8933 : This equipment of yours... If I told you I could hone it to greater heights of power, what would you say?
8934 : What do you say? Most definitely! Maybe another time.
8935 : Splendid! Then let us get right to it... Or rather, that's what I'd like to say. But I fear it's not possible at this precise moment.
8936 : Needless to say, it is not my prowess that is lacking, but rather that my current tools aren't sturdy enough to survive the job.
8937 : However, the power given off by your %... With that, I'd surely be able to work my wonders on your [mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon].
8938 : Don't worry, I won't be taking that % off your hands for good. I merely need to borrow a bit of its power.
8939 : What will you do? Lend it to him. Never mind.
8940 : Oboro eagerly takes hold of the %.
8941 : Now wait just a moment. I'll return shortly.
8942 : Wonderful! Your [mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon] is ready to experience my powers in all their glory... Ah, forgive me. You can have this back now.
8943 : Oboro relinquished the %.
8944 : Do you have anything else like that %? I would love to work my wonders on another piece of equipment for you.
8945 : Now I just need the necessary materials in order to work my magic. As you know, I am a smith without equal. Bring me what I need, and I'll see to the rest.
8946 : That said, the materials I require this time are somewhat special. Without them, I fear I won't be able to help you.
8947 : To be more precise, they're not "materials" as such, but rather something near and dear to you. You could even say they're like your heart and soul. Yes, that is what I need.
8948 : You're an experienced adventurer, so I'm sure you can figure out what I mean.
8949 : Anyhow, once you find that of which I speak, pray deliver it to me.
8950 : Hmm... Yes...in the state that you're in now, I suppose I could...
8951 : ...Ahem. I have a proposal for you. Are you interested?
8952 : Are you interested? Sure. I think not.
8953 : I can take that fancy armament of yours to even greater heights. That said, I can't do it right at this moment.
8954 : No...before I work my magic on your little friend there, I'll need to enhance my tools using the power of your equipment.
8955 : In other words, I'm asking you to help me help you.
8956 : By using your experience to enhance my tools, I can upgrade that equipment of yours. For that, I'll just need some of your job points.
8957 : Just give me your job points from jobs where you can't earn any more. I'll use them to get my tools up to snuff and forge a piece of equipment that'll knock your socks off.
8958 : I think 10,000 job points ought to do it. I believe you can use up to 700 job points per week (Earth time)...
8959 : We have to do this right though. Mess around and my tools won't be up to the job, leaving you with your boring old equipment. And none of us want that, right?
8960 : Lastly, I'll need to use the right tools for the job. That means you'll need enough job points to cover each type of equipment you want to augment.
8961 : You used # job [point/points] for your [mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon]. You still need # job [point/points], and are able to use # more [point/points].
8962 : Now, I can finally get around to taking care of that [mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon] for you.
8963 : You used # job [point/points] for the [mysterious weapon/Balrahn armament/ancient weapon/secret moogle weapon/familiar weapon]. I'm afraid you don't have any points left to use.
8964 : You can't use any more job points. I'm afraid you'll need to come back later.
8965 : Hm? What's that? Did you do that yourself? It looks like it's been altered somehow...
8966 : If I only knew more about it, I might be able to help... Would you mind telling me what you did?
8967 : What will you do? Tell him about the shrouded world. Stay quiet.
8968 : An hourglass? A dreamlike world shrouded in fog? Hmm... I might be able to do something with this, but not in its current state...
8969 : Hmm... [This is/Once again you've brought me something] most interesting... It's not much, but there would seem to be fragments of memories within the %.
8970 : Make your selection and I shall extract it for you.
8971 : What will you do? Route A. Route B. Route C. Never mind.
8972 : Are you sure? Yes. On second thought...
8973 : It may be a strange way of phrasing it, but it feels as if it's alive somehow...
8974 : If you equip it in that world, I daresay it should give things a nice boost.
8975 : Of course, you can upgrade your equipment in this world, too...provided you have a certain something. Should you find that something, pray bring it to me.
8976 : This equipment may yet be augmented further. Pray bring it back to me some time.
8977 : This equipment has reached the limit of its powers. I'm afraid I can do no more with it.
8978 : That equipment of yours... Let me see it.
8979 : Hmm... How interesting... Actually, it reminds me of the equipment of my homeland.
8980 : But forgive me. I wasn't expecting to see such a familiar item here. Sorry, you can have it back now.
8981 : Let me take another look at your equipment.
8982 : Truly fascinating... Ahem. Forgive me. The craftsmanship seemed unfamiliar to me, so I merely wanted to take a closer look.
8983 : This equipment seems to have slumbered for ages in a land far to the west.
8984 : What will you choose? Mysterious weapon. Balrahn armament. Ancient weapon. Secret moogle weapon. Familiar weapon. Go back. Never mind.
8985 : Use which job points? (# needed)  Warrior. (# job [point/points]) Monk. (# job [point/points]) White Mage. (# job [point/points]) Black Mage. (# job [point/points]) Red Mage. (# job [point/points]) Thief. (# job [point/points]) Paladin. (# job [point/points]) Dark Knight. (# job [point/points]) Beastmaster. (# job [point/points]) Bard. (# job [point/points]) Ranger.

(# job [point/points]) Go back. Never mind.
8986 : You can choose a range from # to #.
8987 : You upgraded the %.
8988 : You will be unable to auction this equipment if you augment it!
8989 : This equipment's abilities will be set to their maximum rank.
8990 : Sagheera has never mentioned anyone who fits your description. How about you follow the proper protocol and speak to her first?
8991 : Ah, so you must be %. Sagheera becomes as lyrical as a traveling minstrel when she sings your praises.
8992 : So you are the one that has the veritable cellar full of relic and artifact equipment? [No wonder I hear her hit the high notes when she is all alone in her room./To be honest, her songs do not nearly do you justice, dear.]
8993 : That aside, I have been dispatched to provide you adventurers with a slightly different type of crafting service.
8994 : We have scoured the land for able smiths and weavers, leaving no piece of slag or thread of cloth unaccounted for. With their unparalleled skills, we hope to extricate every last onz of potential that lays dormant within those superior examples of finery.
8995 : Sagheera is a trusted affiliate of ours, so do not worry about articles she has repaired or revived for you in the past. They are covered as well.
8996 : Have I piqued your interest? Then why not peruse the list of restoration plans we have on offer?
8997 : What equipment are you interested in? None. Artifact Equipment. Relic Equipment. Empyrean Equipment. Chapters of Rem's Tale.
8998 : Which set? None. Pummeler's Armor. Anchorite's Attire. Theophany Attire. Spaekona's Attire. Atrophy Armor. Pillager's Attire. Reverence Armor. Ignominy Armor. Totemic Armor. Brioso Attire.

8999 : Which item? None. Go back. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
9000 : In order to reforge your current piece into %, you will have to come up with %, %, and %.
9001 : ...And remember that the Tenshodo is no charity. We are going to need # ) as compensation.
9002 : I suppose it will be sufficient if you hand over % instead of %, but in that case, we shall require # ) in payment.
9003 : Once our magnificent craftsmen have worked their magic, your previously pathetic duds should look something like that.
9004 : Thanks for actually bringing what I told you to. You cannot imagine how many imbeciles fail to listen to directions. Also remember that art takes time to create, so do not come yelling in my face if your gear is not ready yet.
9005 : Sorry, but our expert team of practitioners is still taking the utmost care in reconditioning your outfit. It shall be done soon enough, though.
9006 : Sorry for the wait, but your equipment is finally in. Are you not relieved that you did not rush our genius?
9007 : Which set? None. Agoge Armor. Hesychast's Attire. Piety Attire. Archmage's Attire. Vitiation Attire. Plunderer's Attire. Caballarius Armor. Fallen's Armor. Ankusa Armor. Bihu Attire.

9008 : This is by no means some drunken tailor's side project, and therefore, revitalizing your current piece into % requires %, %, and %.
9009 : Depending on the condition of the % you donate, I will consider lowering the price on our one-of-a-kind service.
9010 : As for the quality of your %... If you truly covet low, low prices and bring me the best of the best, I shall be content to accept only # ) as additional payment.
9011 : Should you be content with % that are less than the perfect but still more than worthwhile, I will ask for # ) instead.
9012 : If you are comfortable providing a mere %--and my utter disdain for your lack of ambition--then fetch me # ) and # %.
9013 : Having % means that I will accept your request with the payment of # ) and %.
9014 : Or perhaps you would rather check upon the various plans we offer for our phenomenal work? Well then, be my guest.
9015 : Which set? None. Boii Armor. Bhikku Attire. Ebers Attire. Wicce Attire. Lethargy Armor. Skulker's Armor. Chevalier's Armor. Heathen's Armor Nukumi Armor. Fili Attire. Amini Attire.

9016 : The reforging process requires a good deal of elbow grease and very specific materials. I require %, %, and # ) to craft %.
9017 : And don't think I'll give away my services for a gil and a song. I require payment in the form of # %.
9018 : Say, aren't you getting tired of lugging around all those chapters of Rem's tale? I'll be happy to hold onto them for you until you need them.
9019 : # %? Got it. That makes for a total of # that I am holding for you.
9020 : Interested in what I'm holding for you? Let's take a look.
9021 : View which item? None. %. (# held) %. (# held) %. (# held) %. (# held) %. (# held) %. (# held) %. (# held) %. (# held) %. (# held) %. (# held)
9022 : How many % would you like me to return?
9023 : Enter a number between 0 and #. 0 will return to the previous selection.
9024 : Here you go. # %.
9025 : I can't hold any more of those for you!
9026 : Yo, %, I hauled tail as soon as I heard!
9027 : Oh, my! I hear things have gotten a bit rough lately!
9028 : You shoulda heard Tenzen prattle on! Dying world this, dark future that...ugh. It was all I could do not to smack him right in the kisser!
9029 : Figured the old fart was trying to pull the wool over my eyes.
9030 : C'mon. Even if the world were really in danger, all it would take is a quick few shakes of my fist and everything'd be right as rain.
9031 : I mean, seriously. Right?
9032 : I admit his ominous words were a bit scary. The world is dying, the future is bleak...
9033 : Now that I'm no longer able to look deeply into people's hearts, I couldn't tell if he was playing a cruel joke.
9034 : But then it struck me--even if something terrible was about to happen, you'd be able to see us through it.
9035 : You would, wouldn't you?
9036 : Can you save Vana'diel? Of course. I'm not confident...
9037 : Ah, Lady Prishe. 'Tis good to see you looking your usual chipper self.
9038 : 'Course I am.
9039 : Gimme a break. You keep spewing a load of crap about the end of the world, so how else am I supposed to react?
9040 : We already put a lid on that messy business, so there's nothing left to worry about!
9041 : Lady Prishe...? Are you feeling ill?
9042 : Why, most certainly.
9043 : How else would one feel when an old friend comes bearing ill tidings about the end of the world?
9044 : Have we not already solved this problem? Why would it rear its ugly head anew? It's enough to set my head swimming!
9045 : Ah, that would explain it. I must confess to having difficulty discerning my right from my left as well these past weeks...
9046 : This creepy old coot rushes in and starts blabbing about dying world this, dark future that...ugh. It was all I could do not to smack him right in the kisser!
9047 : The blood rushed to my head and now it's pounding like I just ran face-first into a wall!
9048 : Ah. Well, that solves the mystery of his obnoxious prattling.
9049 : Then this whole Emptiness thing's gotta be connected, right?
9050 : And you mean to say that it's our destiny to send it packing?
9051 : This crazy ninja lady burst into my place in Tavnazia and dragged me over here kicking and screaming.
9052 : She said Despachiaire would never miss me, what with the way he's got his eye on Ulmia like a hawk.
9053 : Think it's safe for me to be here?
9054 : Lady Prishe, surely Kagero explained to you the gravity of the situation.
9055 : All those close to you, whether in Tavnazia or beyond, are in grave danger.
9056 : You shoulda heard Tenzen prattle on! Dying world this, dark future that...ugh. It was all I could do not to smack him right in the kisser!
9057 : Old coot is so damn noisy it was like I had those three Tarutaru dancing in my head.
9058 : Lady Prishe, are you not the least bit concerned!?
9059 : All those close to you, whether in Tavnazia or beyond, are in grave danger!
9060 : Yeah, yeah. But what good does it do any of us to sit here with our thumbs up our butts moaning about it?
9061 : Less talk, more action!
9062 : A most becoming response. But how are we to act when we know so little?
9063 : Didn't you mention something 'bout a delicate little waif from the future who had all the answers?
9064 : Unfortunately, although Iroha can see the grand picture, there are many details that escape her.
9065 : The one most familiar with the situation is he who came after her.
9066 : This ambassador from the void guy, yeah. I've half a mind to rip that mask from his scrawny little neck and expose him for the sham he is!
9067 : And this would be your masked ambassador from the void?
9068 : Would that our paths had crossed, but I know only his name.
9069 : And that [Lord/Lady] % and Lady Iroha sparred with him.
9070 : And!? Did you pop him a new one?
9071 : What happened then?
9072 : How do you respond? He was fearsome. I barely broke a sweat. He looked...amazing!
9073 : You gotta show idiots like that who's boss!
9074 : Next time the pounding will come right from me!
9075 : So you did not come into direct conflict?
9076 : I know we can claim victory the next time if we work together!
9077 : That's the % I know and love!
9078 : Hang on--you didn't actually smack him around, did you!?
9079 : Can't fool me! My fingers start to twitch whenever someone's trying to finagle their way out of the truth!
9080 : That's wonderful news!
9081 : Wait. Was that...a joke?
9082 : How undeniably cruel! Why would you get any enjoyment out of toying with me?
9083 : Thinkin' he can just snatch victory like candy from a babe, no doubt!
9084 : Let him do what he wants, I say! I'll mangle his face so bad he'll never dare to remove that mask!
9085 : If he's as impressive as you claim, I would surely like to meet him.
9086 : But goodness, my knees would certainly turn to jelly.
9087 : This is no time for nonsense. That man can call forth voids at will.
9088 : Wait...there's something desperately wrong...
9089 : Hm?
9090 : Aaaaaah!
9091 : Hm?
9092 : Eeep!
9093 : There is no need for concern, Lady Prishe.
9094 : The same thing happened earlier. The orb filling with light--this is what Iroha was mentioning, is it not?
9095 : Urk! I thought the damn thing was trying to rip my soul from my body!
9096 : Lady Prishe, I assure you no such thing would occur.
9097 : Hmph. Long as I'm still in one piece I couldn't give a flying fig.
9098 : But let's track back a minute to where we can find this Iroha of yours.
9099 : I...I felt like my soul was being ripped from my body!
9100 : Thank the heavens! Hopefully my shivers will calm down...
9101 : But wait--where can we find Iroha?
9102 : She had promised to be here...
9103 : Do you suppose something happened to her?
9104 : What do you think? Maybe she got lost? She didn't seem well. Think she forgot?
9105 : Only in the most dire of circumstances is a priestess from Reisenjima Sanctorium permitted to leave the tiny island.
9106 : And now she might be lost in this most bustling of towns--I must find her before something happens!!!
9107 : So you're saying she let it hurl? That can't be good.
9108 : Whatever shall we do?
9109 : A priestess's calling is to remain sheltered in her cloister and pray to the gods.
9110 : And now she might be lost in this most bustling of towns--I must find her before something happens!!!
9111 : She probably caught a whiff of some sausages or something and is gorging herself as we speak.
9112 : Lady Prishe, a priestess from the Far East is not tempted by such carnal desires.
9113 : Well, she must have found some stunning number and is flitting from store to store wasting ponzes of gil on cute little baubles.
9114 : Ahem. Our priestesses take vows of poverty, and I highly doubt that centuries-old tradition will have changed in the future.
9115 : Then I bet someone beat her up and left her lying in a ditch!
9116 : Perhaps the delectable scent of sausages enticed her?
9117 : Well...maybe she found some delightful dress and is spending her hours at the clothiers?
9118 : What if...what if someone accosted her!?
9119 : D-do you think that's possible!?
9120 : I must find her before it is too late!!!
9121 : I should probably head off to find her, too.
9122 : Maybe she made her way to Lower Jeuno?
9123 : This whole incident has me quite concerned. Perhaps it is best if I join in the search.
9124 : I'll see what I can find in Lower Jeuno.
9125 : Hmm... It seems I can never find the perrrfect person. Although, I know that one day, somebody'll come along... Mwahaha!
9126 : Oh! What do we have here!? Yes! You're just the perrrson I've been looking for!
9127 : Mwahaha. Let me guess, you're a craftsman skilled in the art of [/woodworking/smithing/goldsmithing/clothcraft/leathercraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking]. Am I rrright?
9128 : No, don't answer that, my frrriend. I can tell just by looking at you!
9129 : I have a favor to ask. Please, hear me out.
9130 : Firrrst, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mewk Chorosap. I'm a member of the Inventors' Coalition in Adoulin.
9131 : See, that's where you come in. I need your help with a new item I'm worrrking on. Mwahaha.
9132 : Recently, I've been interrrested in crystal synthesis. In all of Vana'diel, the Middle Lands is known more than any other area for using crystal synthesis.
9133 : Therefore, I took a trrrip to see how the process works.
9134 : I'm so glad I came here! I can actually picture it now! A bright future where my technology and crystal synthesis are fused together in glorrrious harmony!
9135 : Mwahahaha!
9136 : Since you are a big part of this future, I want you to have this prrresent.
9137 : You see, this is a kind of item to support and even enhance your efforts when it comes to synthesizing items.
9138 : Of course, right now, it's just an orrrdinary shield.
9139 : When synthesizing crystals, one's mind plays an imporrrtant part in visualizing the finished product.
9140 : The power of the mind is also requirrred by this shield.
9141 : So when craftsmen like yourself equip this shield, and try really hard to synthesize items over and over again, your blood, sweat, tears, and your very soul itself will be poured into the shield.
9142 : I have coined the term Craftsmanship to describe the arrrt of imbuing the strength of one's mind into an object.
9143 : Once your Craftsmanship reaches a cerrrtain level, you will be able to synthesize a crystal.
9144 : You can then combine that crystal with special ingrrredients from the Inventors' Coalition to use on the shield I gave you.
9145 : If it all goes according to plan, you'll end up with a brrrand-new shield.
9146 : By crrrafting the shield over and over again, you can boost its ability to its maximum value.
9147 : I have left the necessary ingredients with the [/Carpenters'/Smithing/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild, so please check with your guildmaster.
9148 : However, I've asked them to not just give you the ingredients without worrrking for them.
9149 : It wouldn't be interrresting if just anybody could make such a powerful thing. Mwahaha.
9150 : I'll give you the shield, so what do you say? Are you interrrested in making it even more powerful? Of course, the road to its completion will be fraught with peril.
9151 : Once you have started to craft an escutcheon, your [/woodworking/blacksmithing/goldsmithing/weaving/leathcraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking] skill will not reduce until the shield is completed or you cancel the process.
9152 : What will you do? Leave it to me! I think I better pass.
9153 : Really? Well, I suppose even if I did give it to somebody whose hearrrt wasn't in it, it wouldn't go very well. In that case, I'll take the shield back then.
9154 : If you ever feel like showing me what you're trrruly made of, I'll be here waiting for you. Mwahaha.
9155 : Mwahahaha. I knew you had it in you. I suppose I lit a fire within that crrraftsman's heart of yours.
9156 : Now then. Show that shield to your guildmaster. The path forward will be rrrevealed to you.
9157 : When you're finished, you'll need to receive a sign on the shield from your guildmaster that it's finished. Then brrring it back to me. I'm counting on you. Mwahaha.
9158 : Why hello there, my [/woodworking/smithing/goldsmithing/clothcraft/leathercraft/bonecraft/alchemy/cooking] expert. What is the prrroblem?
9159 : What can I do for you? Never mind. I want to check the recipe. I want a catalyst. Tell me about these apparatuses. I want to try making the shield. I give up trying to make the shield.
9160 : Mwahahaha. In that case, good luck to you, my frrriend.
9161 : How's that shield coming? Finished yet?
9162 : Good. Now let me have a look.
9163 : Mwahaha. It's nice to see you're up for the challenge, my frrriend.
9164 : In that case, I'll need to give you this.
9165 : In rrregards to the other ingredients, I mentioned this before, but you'll need to speak with your guildmaster.
9166 : At least, that's what I would say if you still didn't have that %. Dispose of it firrrst.
9167 : Oh, what happened to give you a change of hearrrt? Are you sure you want to quit?
9168 : Note that reattempting will require you to abandon your current shield in progress.
9169 : Really abandon your current shield?
9170 : Do you really want to quit? On second thought, I'll stick with it. Yes, I've had enough.
9171 : Mwahaha. That's what I like to hear. Keep up the good worrrk.
9172 : Well, that is most unforrrtunate.
9173 : That shield will do you no good, so be surrre to get rid of it.
9174 : Mwahaha. I've been waiting for this. Let's see what you've brrrought me.
9175 : It must've been hard when you firrrst started using this shield. It is difficult to get your spirit in tune with the crystal.
9176 : Hmm...
9177 : Yes, I imagined as much, but was hoping it'd turn out better.
9178 : This is nowhere near the level I was expecting to see.
9179 : I suppose a single upgrrrade is only enough to bring it this far. Although, there is no denying that it has gained some ability.
9180 : Mwahaha. Can I have a little more time? It looks like I need to rrrethink the design a bit.
9181 : Here, take this shield. And I forrrbid you from losing it.
9182 : Once the prrreparations are complete, you'll need to perform the next upgrade. I hope you're looking forward to it as much as I am.
9183 : (Hmm... Maybe mythril alone makes the spiritual link too weak? In that case, I'll need a differrrent metal. What could I use instead...)
9184 : Hm? Mwahaha. I see you are eager to get starrrted. I need just a little more time.
9185 : I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. My prrreparations are complete. Mwahaha.
9186 : I'm going to get it rrready for the upgrade, so can I borrow the % for a moment?
9187 : Thank you. Okay, this won't take very long, so just wait a little longer.
9188 : There. That should do the trrrick.
9189 : Take this and trrry the synthesis again multiple times.
9190 : Once your spirit has been sufficiently imbued into the shield, you can try crrrafting the shield again.
9191 : The ingrrredients have been left with your guild, so speak to your guildmaster for more information.
9192 : Simply show this shield to your parrrticular guildmaster and they'll know what to do.
9193 : I'm interrrested to see what this shield can become. Yes, very interested indeed. Mwahaha.
9194 : Mwahaha... I've been anxiously awaiting your rrreturn. So, how did it turn out?
9195 : I see...
9196 : It falls within the rrrange I was expecting, based on the results of our previous attempt.
9197 : Splendid. I think you'll rrreally see an improvement with the next upgrade!
9198 : Mwahaha. I'll prrrepare the next ingredient for the Inventors' Coalition.
9199 : Be sure to make the next upgrade once the preparations are rrready. Mwahaha.
9200 : (Hmm... If I could use that sheet, it could serve as a kind of antennae... The problem is the weight... Maybe next time, I'll...)
9201 : Mwahaha. What can I do for you, my frrriend?
9202 : Hmm... There's something wrrrong with this shield. I don't think it's capable of properly channelling your spirit.
9203 : Although, it's still perrrfectly repairable, if you so desire.
9204 : However, know that repairing the % will reset the escutcheon's progress to when you first received the %.
9205 : Do you want to repair the shield? Sure. No thanks.
9206 : Okay, I'll make the rrrepairs. Wait just a moment.
9207 : That should do it.
9208 : ou must complete the Records of Eminence objective % to further enhance your shield.
9209 : Sorry to keep you waiting. The prrreparations are finally complete.
9210 : Hm? Is there something you'd like to ask me, frrriend?
9211 : There appears to be interference with the synchronicity of the crystal. Yes, it seems that it is that rrrather annoying factor once again.
9212 : It would appear that parrrticular factor is hounding us once again...
9213 : However, there's no need to let it get us down. I've learrrned a way to mitigate its effects. Mwahaha.
9214 : Crafting under cerrrtain conditions enables you to boost Craftsmanship more than usual, yes?
9215 : When you take advantage of that situation, the factor is trrriggered, making your life more difficult.
9216 : However, if you don't utilize this parrrticular condition, the effect of the factor grows stronger and stronger, meaning you should try to use it as much as possible.
9217 : Were you able to comprrrehend all that? At any rate, simply show this shield to your guildmaster like before.
9218 : Actually, I can't have you bothering your guildmaster all the time, so I'll explain part of the prrrocess here.
9219 : First, you're going to need the rrrecipe.
9220 : Required craft: [Fishing/Woodworking/Smithing/Goldsmithing/Clothcrafting/Leathercrafting/Bonecrafting/Alchemy/Cooking] [ /Woodworking/Smithing/Goldsmithing/Clothcrafting/Leathercrafting/Bonecrafting/Alchemy/Cooking] [ /Woodworking/Smithing/Goldsmithing/Clothcrafting/Leathercrafting/Bonecrafting/Alchemy/Cooking] [ /Woodworking/Smithing/Goldsmithing/Clothcrafting/Leathercrafting/Bonecrafting/Alchemy/Cooking] Required crystal: % Required items...
9221 : # ) # ) # ) # )
9222 : # ) # ) # )
9223 : # ) # )
9224 : # )
9225 : That's all of them. I hope you wrote that down?
9226 : Next, I'll go over how to obtain the necessary materials. I've hearrrd there are a total of three.
9227 : Firrrst, you'll need the old standby, %.
9228 : Like usual, you'rrre going to have to boost the Craftsmanship of the % to 100% and show it to your guildmaster.
9229 : Although, this may have been the most difficult thing to incrrrease the Craftsmanship for. Remember, crafting various kinds of items is the secret to success.
9230 : Next, we have the % and %. These too are exactly like you experrrienced before.
9231 : Was it a crafting set? Make your deliveries and then you can use the points earned to trrrade for the item.
9232 : After that, the % and % come next. Hmm... I rrrecommend you check with your guildmaster on these two.
9233 : That's all I have to say on the matter.
9234 : Mwahaha! It seems the shield is nearly finished. Don't forrrget to have your guildmaster mark the shield after it's been upgraded.
9235 : Mwahaha. So, how did it turn out? Allow me to take a closer look at your prrrize.
9236 : Hmm... This is...
9237 : Mwahahaha!
9238 : Perrrfect!
9239 : This is exactly the rrresult I was hoping for!
9240 : Oh, please forrrgive me. I got a little carried away after seeing things turn out just as I anticipated. Mwahaha.
9241 : I'm finding it harrrd to contain my excitement. This means the next upgrade will be the one. Mwahahaha!
9242 : I'll get on the Inventors' Coalition to begin making the next set of preparations rrright away. I hope you're as excited as I am.
9243 : (Hmm... The ultimate synchronicity... Now, to prepare the craftsman's symbol possessed by the guild...)
9244 : Oh, my. I even told you to write the recipe down, too. Try to rrremember it this time.
9245 : Mwahaha. Are you okay? Keep up the good work out there, my frrriend.
9246 : Ahh, I see you've made it to the final stage at last.
9247 : Now then, let's get starrrted, shall we? Let me see your %.
9248 : Thank you. I am extremely grrrateful for all of your hard work up to now.
9249 : Now then, let's rrreview the necessary materials for the procedure.
9250 : First, there's the % and the %.
9251 : These two items can be exchanged for crafter points at your guild.
9252 : You'll need two % and one % to prrroceed.
9253 : Next up is the %. You already know how it works. Although this time arrround, it can't simply be used as is.
9254 : The % is the physical manifestation of a crrraftsman's heart and soul. Although it powers the final upgrade, you will need to activate it first.
9255 : Once you obtain it, bring it to me. I'll tell you what you need to perrrform the activation.
9256 : By the way, do you rrremember how to obtain the %?
9257 : You'll need the help of your guildmaster after rrraising the shield's Craftsmanship to 100%.
9258 : That rrreminds me... I've managed to eliminate the rather unfortunate factor that previously plagued this shield!
9259 : This will free you from those rather rrridiculous failures that you experienced before.
9260 : And so our explanation ends here!
9261 : Listen carefully. Once you obtain the %, bring it to me rrright away.
9262 : Well, good luck to you out there. I'll be anxiously awaiting your rrreturn.
9263 : Ahh, I see you managed to obtain the %. Excellent work, my frrriend.
9264 : Now, it's time to explain how to perrrform the activation.
9265 : In order to activate the %, you must firrrst imbue it with your craftsman's spirit to previously unimaginable levels.
9266 : Using the regular methods, you'd need to craft with it several million times, but that isn't very rrrealistic, now is it?
9267 : That is why I've crrreated a special device to help assist with the crafting process.
9268 : Using this synthesis focuser during your crafting sessions will help boost your spirit and imbue it within your %.
9269 : You just need to simply flip the switch and begin crafting, although some prrreparations are necessary.
9270 : You'll need to place the % inside the synthesis focuser, along with the crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst needed for the crafting process.
9271 : For the crystal, please note that you cannot use the high-quality crystals or analysis crystals used for the engraving prrrocess.
9272 : I'm going to place the % within the synthesis focuser for now.
9273 : Once the materials are set, you can begin the crafting process.
9274 : If everything goes as planned, it will infuse your % with a large amount of spirit. Once a sufficient amount has been trrransferred, it will activate the %.
9275 : Did you manage to comprrrehend all that? If so, then I shall continue...
9276 : With this parrrticular kind of crafting, you're also able to form links while crafting!
9277 : I like to call this type of link a craftchain. I know... I know... It's nothing fancy. Mwahaha.
9278 : You alrrready know about the skillchains that you use in battle. This is kind of like that.
9279 : The skillchain is triggered when you select the appropriate weapon skills with the proper timing, right?
9280 : A craftchain is triggered when you use the proper crafting sphere and catalyst, also with the proper timing.
9281 : Once the craftchain is triggered, it will boost your spirit by an even greater amount. You really want to use them if at all possible.
9282 : Now, allow me to explain about the crafting spheres that I mentioned prrreviously.
9283 : Crafting spheres are a type of material that are intricately linked with crystals and craftchains.
9284 : This'll prrrobably go faster if I just show you one.
9285 : This is what we call %.
9286 : And since Liquefaction includes a fire elemental, you will need to use %.
9287 : Be sure to keep one thing in mind. If you use a crystal that doesn't match the element, the synthesis is guaranteed to fail.
9288 : There are 14 types of crafting sphere in all, the same number as the skillchains, with the exception of the Ultimate Skillchains of courrrse.
9289 : However, you will need to learrrn the linking procedure for yourself.
9290 : Now I will explain about the other material in the prrrocess...the catalyst.
9291 : The catalyst is a material that has a grrreat effect on the success of your craftchain.
9292 : You already know how skillchains have levels, rrright?
9293 : Craftchains also have levels, and you will need to use a catalyst that matches the element of the crafting sphere.
9294 : I have here an example of a catalyst. It comes from the Inventors' Coalition's verrry own MC-I-SR0 series!
9295 : The linking process has thrrree levels, just like with skillchains. Depending on the crafting sphere you use, the catalyst will be selected automatically.
9296 : Now I'd like to explain crafting failures in a bit more detail.
9297 : If your combination of crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst are incorrect, the synthesis is guarrranteed to fail.
9298 : And if it fails, you will lose the crystal, crafting sphere, and catalyst you used.
9299 : Additionally, you will also lose some of the spirit stored within your %.
9300 : That will mean much of your hard work will be for naught, so be especially carrreful when selecting your materials.
9301 : I rrrealize this explanation is dragging on a bit, but how's it going? Try to hang in there for just a little bit longer.
9302 : Now I want to explain how to obtain the materials you'll rrrequire.
9303 : You can get the MC-I-SR0 series catalyst from me, for the rrright price of course...
9304 : The cost of manufacturing is rather high for this particular catalyst, so I got an earful from the coalition's accountant after I made it in bulk.
9305 : If I don't turn a profit, it will adversely affect our rrresearch budget... So, sorry about that. I hope you understand.
9306 : The crafting spheres are a somewhat unique item. You can obtain them by using a special technique that brrreaks down certain items into their individual components.
9307 : You'll need to learn the technique before you can prrroceed. This should be everything you need to master it.
9308 : Mwahaha. You can have this one frrree of charge.
9309 : Now, about the item to be used as a base for the technique...
9310 : The % and the %...
9311 : You should be able to use the % with the %, and the % with the % for the prrrocedure.
9312 : I believe there are more items out there that can be used. The exact number is unknown, but just consider finding them yet another part of the challenge.
9313 : You can obtain information from other adventurers, or just keep experrrimenting until you find the answers for yourself.
9314 : However, just be careful that you don't lose any valuable items in the process, even if it is in the name of prrrogress.
9315 : I have a feeling that the items used to create the spheres contain some common factors. Of course, I have no evidence to back it up...
9316 : That concludes my explanation. I imagine crrreating the spheres will keep you busy for some time to come. Good luck.
9317 : Ahh... So this is the one I've heard so much aboutaru...
9318 : Oh, how long have you been here?
9319 : I justaru arrived.
9320 : Mwahaha. Yes, I suppose so.
9321 : Although, I was not expecting you to be the one to brrring me the synthesis focuser.
9322 : I have my reasons-weasons. It needed a few adjustments before delivery. I know you aren't very good at that sort of thing.
9323 : Yes, I suppose you're rrright about that. I am much better at seeing the bigger picture.
9324 : By the way, were you able to properly explain the instructions to your guestaru?
9325 : Of course I was.
9326 : Really? You often tend to leave out rather important details-wetails, so I'm sure you understand my concern.
9327 : E-enough about that alrrready. If you just got here, does that mean you were in Mhaura?
9328 : Mhaura... I hear it's quite a bustling place, so I have some interestaru in it, but as long as she's there, I think I'll pass.
9329 : Besides, I had some minor business to attend to. I paid a visitaru to each of the three countries in the Middle Lands.
9330 : Of course, I made a pointaru to bring back some souvenirs for everybody in the coalition!
9331 : Look! I purchased-wurchased % and %, along with % and %.
9332 : There's % and %... What's this thing again? I forgotaru...
9333 : Oh yes... This is a little-wittle trinket I picked up along the way. It's for you, Mewk.
9334 : ...
9335 : There's also % and %...
9336 : And then... Oh!
9337 : I had better get going or else I won't make it in time to prepare for the nextaru investigation!
9338 : Sorry that I'm so busy rightaru now.
9339 : Well then, I'll waitaru until I hear from you again!
9340 : %... I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to do with this prrresent...
9341 : Hm? There's something wrrritten on the back.
9342 : What's this!? You've completed the activation!
9343 : Yes, everything looks perrrfect. The activation is complete. You did it!
9344 : Mwahaha... Would you like to go over the rrrecipe?
9345 : I'd like to check the materials before you begin the synthesis, so would you mind showing them to me firrrst?
9346 : Mwahaha. Now then, let's review the rrrecipe, shall we?
9347 : Mwahaha. Impressive. Are you ready to perrrform the synthesis now?
9348 : ...
9349 : ...
9350 : Hm? What's the matter? Is something wrrrong?
9351 : What's that? You're trrrying to tell me the synthesis won't start!?
9352 : I don't get it... What could've gone wrrrong...
9353 : I wonder if the rrrecipe was mistaken... I don't see how though...
9354 : Perrrhaps you did not sufficiently activate the object? No, that can't be it!
9355 : Wait! That rrreminds me...
9356 : I'm sorry. There's one more thing you rrrequire. It should be with your guildmaster.
9357 : Do you think you could bring it here for me?
9358 : (Thanks, Mikolulu. I completely forrrgot about that note.)
9359 : (That note... If I had thrown it carrrelessly away without noticing, I wonder what I would have done...)
9360 : I'm sorry. My rrrequest was rather pointless. The thing I asked of you is already here.
9361 : Here you go. Mwahaha. It's a rrrather exceptional emblem.
9362 : Allow me to go over the rrrecipe once more.
9363 : Do you have all of the materials? If so, perrrform the synthesis and show me the completed shield.
9364 : So, this is what all of the commotion is about...
9365 : This is what I have spent all this time purrrsuing...
9366 : It's...
9367 : It's completed at last!
9368 : Mwahaha. I'm sorry to have frrrightened you. However, I was simply unable to contain my excitement. Mwahahaha!
9369 : Well, looks like I'll be having to share that with the guildmaster!
9370 : Yes... Go and show that shield to your guildmaster.
9371 : Mwahaha. Welcome back. I imagine your guildmaster was rrrather pleased, no?
9372 : That rrreminds me... I don't think I ever thanked you properly.
9373 : With this project, I started out looking for a way to rrrevolutionize the manufacturing process, but I never would've succeeded without your assistance.
9374 : Thank you for helping me all this time. And congrrratulations on finally completing the escutcheon.
9375 : I hope crrraftsmen across the land will use that shield to create higher quality goods than ever before.
9376 : I'll be here if you ever need me. Feel free to come ask me anything. Mwahahaha!
9377 : Learn about what? Transmutation. Chains. Spheres. Catalysts. Obtaining materials. Penalties for failure. Nothing.
9378 : There are some conditions for losing your spirit.
9379 : The Synthesis Focuser II will become unstable if certain things are done repeatedly.
9380 : Those certain things are continuing to use the same crystal and continuing to do the same chain.
9381 : If it remains unstable for too long, the Synthesis Focuser II may explode if or when the synthesis fails, meaning that you are more likely to lose some of your spirit.
9382 : Stability is restored over time or by increasing the level of your chain.
9383 : An explosion will also restore stability to the focuser, although I highly recommend you do not take this route.
9384 : The Stability gauge displays the focuser's current stability.
9385 : Mwahaha! Very well. Which do you prrrefer?
9386 : Which catalyst do you want to buy? MC-I-SR01 (# gil) MC-I-SR02 (# gil) MC-I-SR03 (# gil) Never mind.
9387 : How many would you like?
9388 : You want the [/MC-I-SR01/MC-I-SR02/MC-I-SR03]? It is going to cost you # for # of them. Please note that there are absolutely no rrreturns. Are you sure?
9389 : Make the purchase? (Gil: #) Yes. No thanks.
9390 : Oh. It seems you have too many to place within the synthesis focuser. Do try to keep the limit in mind...
9391 : Hmm... It seems you can't place any more within the synthesis focuser.
9392 : Thanks. Mwahaha. I'll rrready the synthesis focuser.
9393 : You now have # of the [/MC-I-SR01/MC-I-SR02/MC-I-SR03] remaining in your inventory!

9443 : Hey, you're the one that was with Maat...
9444 : Are you lookin' for something?
9445 : What are you looking for? The Destiny Destroyers. Odin's servant. A demon.
9446 : Whoa! You've gotta tell us all about it!
9447 : Whoa! You've gotta tell us all about it!
9448 : Oh, really!? W-would you mind telling us more!?
9449 : Haha! So those Goblins are...
9450 : ...trying to find out more about the World Eater Egg.
9451 : We'd be happy to tell ya what we know.
9452 : Hehehe... I can share what I learned from one of my orb suppliers...
9453 : First of all, the situation in Valhalla is exactly what you and the Goblins think it is.
9454 : The World Eater Egg that was hidden somewhere in Valhalla was broken open. Or at least that's what I heard.
9455 : I thought Odin would do something about it, but things didn't quite go as expected.
9456 : If you want to know more, you should speak with the new demon known as Duke Alloces.
9457 : I believe he shows up from time to time at Elijah's in Upper Jeuno.
9458 : Although he hasn't been there lately. Maybe he got tired of Elijah's sarcastic personality--he wouldn't be the first.
9459 : Also, I imagine you're curious about how Maat managed to split open the World Eater Egg.
9460 : That World Eater Egg was sealed away in Delkfutt's Tower on Qufim Island.
9461 : The one who sealed it away...I believe he goes by the name of Delkfutt.
9462 : According to him, the shell already had a crack in it.
9463 : Apparently, someone in San d'Oria put a crack in the egg roughly twenty years ago.
9464 : Delkfutt was mumbling about how people always stick their noses where they don't belong.
9465 : Well, I suppose they're better than the Gigas; they hid the fact that the egg had been stolen.
9466 : That's true. They probably should've reported it to Delkfutt. You don't want to make a demon angry.
9467 : Although, we were lucky this time. That egg didn't end up doing too much harm.
9468 : Yeah, about that, I heard somethin' that was a little worrisome. Maybe it was because it was Maat...
9469 : Never mind. You should hurry home and eat so you can get some rest.
9470 : If you want to know what happened twenty years ago, you'd need to go back in time.
9471 : If you want more details about what happened twenty years ago, you'd need to go back in time.
9472 : The knights today may not know anything, but the knights that lived at the time might.
9473 : Welcome to the ammunition retrieval service.
9474 : I'm pleased to announce that we've come up with a way for you to retrieve specific ammunition storage items that you may have previously lost--but one time only!
9475 : If you want to retrieve one of said items, all you need to do is trade me the corresponding weapon.
9476 : Please keep in mind that this is a one-time-only service per weapon. There will be no second retrieval process available.
9477 : Please note that this system is specific to the ammunition storage items, and you will not be able to retrieve a discarded weapon itself.
9478 : Any questions? Tell me about the service. What weapons are applicable? What do I do if I've lost it? Back.
9479 : I have compiled all applicable weapons into one list. If it's not on the list, I cannot help you.
9480 : Weapon list: %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Understood.
9481 : The % is related to the %.
9482 : If you wish to retrieve your %, trade me your %.
9483 : Before I forget, I would like to remind you that you have the Recycle Bin feature.
9484 : Do you know this feature? The one in the Items menu? The one on my desktop? No clue.
9485 : That's right. Make sure to check there if you accidentally discard something you didn't mean to.
9486 : I suppose an explanation is in order.
9487 : If you accidentally discard something you didn't mean to, stay calm and open up the Items submenu from the main menu.
9488 : At the top right is an entry for the Recycle Bin. You can retrieve your accidentally discarded item from there.
9489 : Up to ten items you have discarded while in your current area are stored in the bin.
9490 : If you throw away 11 or more items, the oldest ones are deleted first. The bin is also emptied when you log out or change areas.
9491 : If you make a mistake, don't panic. Check the bin first!
9492 : Hopefully this will help you avoid any accidents in the future!
9493 : You want to retrieve the item associated with this weapon? Let me take a look.
9494 : Hmm. The item associated with this weapon is the %.
9495 : But you've already retrieved the item once before, so I cannot help you again.
9496 : Hang on...I think you've got that item located in a storage system somewhere. Take a good look.
9497 : I'm sorry. My services don't apply to that item.
9498 : This will be your one and only retrieval of your %. Are you sure?
9499 : Retrieve your %? Yes. No.
9500 : Here you are. Make sure not to lose it again!
9501 : Understood. Let me know if you change your mind.
9502 : So the gate in the north has been opened. Perhaps the day I am to be recalled is near at last...
