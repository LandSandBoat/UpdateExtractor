6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7326 : There is a hollow here in the shape of %.
7327 : The lycopodium is entranced by a sparkling light...
7328 : Your memory is engraved with an image of your surroundings and the fragrance of flowers...
7329 : The ground is sparkling with a strange light.
7330 : The sparkling light seems vaguely familiar to you...
7331 : You sense that a certain trigger may awaken the memories slumbering in your mind.
7332 : The fragrance of the flower sends your senses reeling back to the world of the past...
7333 : The relevant battle data has been recorded in your %.
7334 : An unseen force is drawing you towards the maw.
7335 : Warp to Abyssea - [Dummy/La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Grauberg/Uleguerand]? Proceed. Not yet.
7336 : Warp to [Dummy/the La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/the Tahrongi Canyon/the Buburimu Peninsula/the Valkurm Dunes/the Jugner Forest/South Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/Xarcabard/Qufim Island]? Proceed. Not yet.
7337 : You do not possess %...
7338 : Your body cannot cope with further strain. You must rest for another # [minute/minutes].
7339 : To where will you head? [The past/The present]. Walk of Echoes. Nowhere for now.
7340 : These withered flowers seem unable to bloom.
7341 : Now that night has fallen, the flowers bloom with a strange glow.
7343 : Hey!
7344 : There you are! My boy's finally getting some rest, so I followed you. Whew!
7345 : So these are nightflowers, are they? Well, we know where they are, but digging them up's another story. Damn, I wish we had a chocobo!
7346 : Kweh!
7347 : Uh-oh! A monster!
7348 : Kweeeh!
7349 : Oh, just you!
7350 : What? You think we can find roots there?
7351 : Yeah! Here they are!
7352 : I was so rotten to you, but you came through for me.
7353 : Kweh!
7354 : Huh? You'd really carry me back?
7355 : I... I'm sorry for what I did. And I'm grateful for your help.
7356 : And I need to say thanks to you, too. I gotta hurry home now, so stop by my house, and I'll try to make it up to you, okay?
7357 : Hang in there, son... I'm comin' home!
7358 : We have retrieved the artifact. Now what are we to...hm?
7359 : Wait, you're the... Why are you here?
7360 : I see. We must have been overheard by one of the residents of the Mines District. Let me guess, was it Deidogg?
7361 : Nice try, Iron Eater. You were planning this all along.
7362 : No... No, you were hoping [he/she] would get here first.
7363 : What is going on here?
7364 : You have seen through my plan. I never have been talented in the skill of deceit.
7365 : I can sympathize with you, Iron Eater. I think it is terrible that a prized artifact of one of the most respected Mythril Musketeers would be used as a tool in a political squabble.
7366 : Unfortunately, it is exactly something that the senators would do, even though the president or Lord Lucius would make far better use of the artifact.
7367 : However, if we return to San d'Oria with the artifact...
7368 : We will most certainly be impeached. And on top of that, the artifact would never get the chance to be used once again. Armor is meant to be worn.
7369 : Well, it is time to stop complaining and start thinking about our mission report. We sought out and terminated the Goblin thieves, however, there was no sign of the Talekeeper Raogrimm's armor among them.
7370 : Weighing the circumstances, it is impossible to continue our investigation into the matter. I order us to return immediately to Bastok.
7371 : Wait... Didn't we just find the armor?
7372 : Not very bright, are we, Naji? We did not find the armor.
7373 : Really!? Does this mean I can have it? I have been needing some new armor.
7374 : My impression of your mental capacity diminishes by the second. If you walked around wearing that armor, everyone would know that we found it!
7375 : You--you came here searching for this armor. I am sure that the Talekeeper Raogrimm would want a brave adventurer as yourself to use this in battle.
7376 : Just to make sure, we know nothing of that artifact. You found it by chance after battling the Goblin thieves yourself.
7377 : And don't worry. I will have replicas of that armor made so that by the end of the month, there will be hundreds of adventurers wearing the same thing. No one will blink an eye at you.
7378 : Consider it fate that your path has crossed that of the Talekeeper. Use the armor wisely.
7379 : You have too many items. You cannot carry the %. Sort your items, change areas, and try again.
7380 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7381 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7382 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7383 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7384 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7385 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7386 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7387 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7388 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7389 : You've earned conquest points!
7390 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7391 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7392 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7393 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7394 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7395 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7396 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7397 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7398 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7399 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7400 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7401 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7402 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7403 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7404 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7405 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7406 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7407 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7408 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7409 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7410 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7411 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7412 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7413 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7414 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7415 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7416 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7417 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7418 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7419 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7420 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7421 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7422 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7423 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7424 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7425 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7426 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.

7428 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
7429 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
7430 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
7431 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
7432 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
7433 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
7434 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.

7438 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
7439 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
7440 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.

7443 : During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
7444 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
7445 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.

7463 : Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
7464 : It should please you to know that I now also deal in %. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!
7465 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
7466 : I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
7467 : I can teleport you to your home country for # gil or # conquest [point/points].
7468 : Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered.  Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
7469 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
7470 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
7471 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
7472 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
7473 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
7474 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points moderately. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.

7486 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
7487 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
7488 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
7489 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
7490 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
7491 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
7492 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
7493 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
7494 : There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
7495 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.

Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
7502 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...

7508 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
7509 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
7510 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
7511 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
7512 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
7513 : You received # conquest points!
7514 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
7515 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
7516 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
7517 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
7518 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
7519 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
7520 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
7521 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
7522 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
7523 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
7524 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
7525 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
7526 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
7527 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
7528 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
7529 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
7530 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
7720 : PAUSE

7726 : (Hippity hoppity!) He says, You'll have a springy-wing in your step from time to time.
7727 : (Hippity hop!) He says, You'll bouncy-wounce along at the same pace as last year.
7728 : (Hop...hoppity?) He says, Don't get your hopes hoppy-wopping too high.
7729 : (Hop...) Er, ah... There's always next year, so promise me you won't go jump-wumping off any bridges, okay?
7730 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7731 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7732 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7733 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7734 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7735 : Now, listen close...
7736 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7737 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...

7739 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7740 : .........listen......
7741 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7742 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.

7747 : An empty light swirls about the cave, eating away at the surroundings...
7748 : Enter the vortex? Yes. No.
7749 : You find nothing out of the ordinary.
7750 : Today is your lucky day!
7751 : You sense that your lucky color may bring you fortune.
7752 : Hm? What is this? %? How do I know this is not some [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] trick?
7753 : Step back, adventurer! I've got much more important things to worry about now!
7754 : What!? A surprise attack by the beastmen!? And today, of all days...
7755 : In a matter of hours, a handful of new squires will be joining our ranks here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7756 : These young patricians are quite spirited, but they lack valuable battle experience.
7757 : While we need be cautious not to disgrace their family names, we cannot let them fall in battle. We request your assistance in protecting the future of San d'Oria!
7758 : It will not be long before a caravan of traders in search of new trade routes arrives here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7759 : If they were to be injured by the enemy, the economy of San d'Oria could fall into chaos. We request your assistance in protecting the prosperity of our kingdom!
7760 : A group of Temple Knights is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe our daily work.
7761 : Ah, but perhaps this could be a perfect chance to show those pampered sissies that being a true knight comprises more than just chasing about shoplifters and sweeping the chateau gardens. However, no matter how much of a grudge we may hold, we cannot let our Elvaan brothers and sisters fall in battle. Understood?
7762 : In a matter of moments, members of the Royal Guards will be arriving here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare us for our next campaign against the beastmen.
7763 : If the fiends are conniving a surprise attack, I expect you to do your best in assuring that no disgrace will be brought upon the guards' names, as well as preventing any unnecessary bloodshed.
7764 : Today, our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] is blessed with the honor of welcoming an ambassador from the fine Republic of Bastok.
7765 : If anything were to happen to our guest, it could transpire into war between our two nations. I expect you to protect the attach with your very life!
7766 : In a few moments, a new batch of legionary recruits will be enlisted to the Republican Army and dispatched here to the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7767 : However, within their ranks are future scientists and craftsmen. Their deaths would be a great loss for the future of our nation.
7768 : We must ensure their safety, but we also must be careful not to prevent them from fulfilling their duties. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
7769 : In a matter of minutes, a group of mariners will be arriving at our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] for self-defense training.
7770 : We must provide them with battle experience, but we also must ensure their safety. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
7771 : My sources indicate that a party of Gold Musketeers carrying supplies is approaching the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7772 : These soldiers are the best of the best, and more than likely will not require any assistance in the event of an attack. However, if anything were to happen to them...
7773 : Later today, a group of high-ranking officials from Strategic Command will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare for Bastok's next campaign against the beastmen.
7774 : If anything were to happen to the commanders, you and I would both be court-martialed! The Republic is counting on your assistance!
7775 : I have just received word that a group of ambassadors from the Federation of Windurst is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe what measures Bastok has undertaken to maintain stability in the regions under Republican control.
7776 : If the attachs were to be injured on this occasion, the damage suffered to our nations' relationship would be irreparable. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
7777 : Shortly, we will be conducting a test for our mercenary candidates here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7778 : This exam is to help us judge the candidates' skill in battle and help us separate those with talent from those who are bound for deskwork.
7779 : But after an attack by the beastmen...there won't be any candidates left to grade! You've got to help us give these kids a fighting chance!
7780 : It won't be long before a party of Federation scholars will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to do research on the local wildlife.
7781 : These scientists are more powerful with their pens than their swords...but that won't help them against a beastman attack! You've got to help us protect them!
7782 : Hmmm... Later today, a small group of Wize Wizards will be arriving to observe our daily work here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7783 : I say that we give them something to remember! %! It's up to you to prove to those bigwigs that we are the ones who maintain the peace in the Federation! Give those beastmen all you've got! (Just don't let the Wize Wizards get hurt...)
7784 : Today, a party of Federation Patriarchs is scheduled to arrive at the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to plan for Windurst's next campaign against the beastmen.
7785 : If anything were to happen to them, we'd all be reassigned to latrine duty! If you know what's good for you, you won't let anyone lay a finger on them!
7786 : Oh, why did the military attachs from San d'Oria have to come to our outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] now?
7787 : I shudder to think what would happen if an ambassador was injured...or worse! Get out there and protect those Elvaan with your life!
7788 : Excellent work! Your efforts helped protect the future of our nation. Divide this among your companions.
7789 : Our nation suffered an enormous loss today. We must begin reinforcing our defenses immediately!
7790 : Your inability to complete the mission has led to our defeat. The last thing our nation needs is an incompetent adventurer!
7791 : You fought hard, and you proved yourself worthy. You are a great asset to the nation.
7792 : We commend you on your services in helping us avert the beastmen's attack. I do not see them attacking us again any time soon.
7793 : This area is currently conducting a Ballista match. I have no time to trouble myself with your beastman trinkets.
7794 : A party member has an NPC called up. You cannot take part in this event.
7795 : %!? Get back! I can handle this!
7796 : %!? Don't come any closer! This battle is mine!
7797 : %? Step aside. I will handle this!
7798 : %? Stay back. I will handle this!
7799 : %? Don't come! I can do this myself!
7800 : %? Stay back! Leave this one to me!
7801 : %!? Stay back! I will take care of this!
7802 : %!? Stay back! I've got this one!
7803 : %? Stand aside. I will handle this!
7804 : %!? Don't come any closer! I can do this!
7805 : %? Stay back. I will handle this!
7806 : %? Stay where you are! This one is mine!
7807 : Why did you come here? I could have handled that myself.
7808 : Why did you come!? I was fine alone!
7809 : Why did you come? I was fine by myself.
7810 : Why did you come here? I could have done it alone.
7811 : Why did you come here? I was fine by myself.
7812 : What are you doing here? I could have taken care of it alone.
7813 : Why did you come here? I was fine alone.
7814 : Why did you come!? I could have done it by myself!
7815 : Why did you come? I was fine by myself.
7816 : Why did you come? I could have done it myself!
7817 : Why did you come here? I could have done it alone.
7818 : Why are you here? I did not ask you to come, nor did I ask for your help with that creature.
7819 : Luto was worried, you say? Oh... Is that so? Anyway, I'm going back now.
7820 : What? Luto was worried!? Really!? Anyway, I'll be off now!
7821 : Luto was worried? Oh...is that so? ...Well then, if you'll excuse me...
7822 : Luto was worried, you say? Is that so? ...I suppose I shall head back now.
7823 : Huh? Luto was worried about me? I guess I should head back back now...
7824 : Luto was worried about me? Is that right... Well, it's time for me to head back. See you.
7825 : Oh, Luto was worried? Really? ...I guess I should head back now.
7826 : Luto was worried!? Oh! Well, I'm going back now! Bye!
7827 : Luto was worried, eh? Is that so? If you'll excuse me, then...
7828 : Luto was worried? Oh. Okay! Hey, I'm gonna go back now! Buh-bye!
7829 : Luto was worried, you say? Is that so? ...I suppose I shall head back now.
7830 : Luto was worried, you say? Hmph... I'm heading back now.
7831 : There is a gigantic footprint here.
7832 : Whatever made this footprint doesn't seem to be around anymore...
7833 : Whoa! I don't know what made this footprint, but it sure didn't stay around to show us!
7834 : There seems to be no sign of whatever made this footprint...
7835 : It appears that the creature that made this footprint is no longer in the vicinity.
7836 : I'm glad whatever made this footprint isn't still around.
7837 : This footprint is huge! It's a good thing whatever made it isn't still around...
7838 : I don't know what made this footprint, but I don't think it's still around...
7839 : I wonder what made this footprint! I don't see anything around here!
7840 : I see no sign of whatever made this footprint...
7841 : Ohhh, a giant footprint! I don't see anything that could have made that around here!
7842 : It appears that the creature that made this footprint is no longer in the vicinity.
7843 : The owner of this footprint doesn't seem to be around anymore.
7844 : You see the following words scrawled into the snow: Shantotto Empire Provisional Headquarters.
7845 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Bring forth the %...
7846 : You do not meet the requirements.
7847 : The time and destination for your foray into Dynamis will be recorded on your %. === Destination: Dynamis - [Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia] ===

7860 : Players who do not possess % are prohibited from entering Dynamis - [Dummy/San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Beaucedine/Xarcabard/Valkurm/Buburimu/Qufim/Tavnazia].
7861 : % and % cannot be used here.
7862 : %... Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to. The time left to me is short.
7863 : Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...
7864 : I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me... It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...
7865 : Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.
7866 : A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.
7867 : My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully. Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.
7868 : Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world. You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete. My hopes go with you, %.
7869 : There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.
7870 : There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.
7871 : The strands of grass here have been tied together.
7872 : There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.
7873 : I see you have met with Raogrimm. His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.
7874 : In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.
7875 : You will need the %, a key that bridges the void between Vana'diel and that other world.
7876 : It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The % is one of those items.
7877 : You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the %. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...
7878 : That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.
7879 : Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.
7880 : The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.
7881 : We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.
7882 : Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the % to guide you...
7883 : I never believed that my indifference to the state of other nations would cause harm to my beloved San d'Oria...
7884 : As part of my penance, I will infuse the % with what guidance I can.
7885 : I betrayed him... And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...
7886 : Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...
7887 : I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
7888 : Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.
7889 : Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord... This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.
7890 : Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
7891 : Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.
7892 : I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.
7893 : Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.
7894 : Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this %! Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
7895 : There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.
7896 : There is a symbol carved into the rock here.
7897 : I have been waiting for you.
7898 : Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"... Do you understand the significance of these words?
7899 : When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form... Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.
7900 : Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...
7901 : The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.
7902 : Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard.  The next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.
7903 : You must obtain the last trophy. All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.
7904 : Take care, my brave adventurer. May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
7905 : Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning. This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.
7906 : I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death. Is this what they call karma...?
7907 : This land has borne the weight of my sins. I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...
7908 : So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed... Keep your wits aboutaru you, %.
7909 : I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes. Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.
7910 : It is time! Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, %. %! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
7911 : Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a prison of souls.
7912 : Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened. Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...
7913 : It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?
7914 : There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.
7915 : Please pay no mind to my ramblings. You have secured the %. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.
7916 : You will need four such trophies. Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.
7917 : I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...
7918 : Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.
7919 : It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities. If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...
7920 : %. This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.
7921 : When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there. That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.
7922 : What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge. But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...
7923 : That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...
7924 : Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry! I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.
7925 : Now, %. This % is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.
7926 : Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, %. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...
7927 : The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.
7928 : I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.
7929 : Wait, wait, wait! I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but... How can I explain it?
7930 : Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.
7931 : But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order! You've got your paws on the %! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.
7932 : But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.
7933 : % and the four trophies. These artifacts have long been lost to that other world.  The Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.
7934 : It must have been in the time of the Great War... Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.
7935 : Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.
7936 : The % and the %. Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms. Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...
7937 : Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way. However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...
7938 : Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...
7939 : Is it over...?
7940 : No, the rage has merely been dispersed.
7941 : As long as I exist, he will never truly die...
7942 : Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?
7943 : %... You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented. I have not the words to express my gratitude.
7944 : The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more. I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...
7945 : The one who holds sway...?
7946 : Yes. From the center of infinite darkness. I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...
7947 : You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell. The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.
7948 : It was an error in judgment to shelter you... The order of my realm has been disrupted.
7949 : I give to you a duty... You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.
7950 : No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul. No return to the land of blessed light...
7951 : What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness? As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.
7952 : Of one thing I was certain. This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.
7953 : A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.
7954 : Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow. It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.
7955 : Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey. Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.
7956 : %, you may be the one to witness this truth.
7957 : The power stored in the % will soon be drained. And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.
7958 : Do not forget who you are, %. I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.
7959 : My old companions...?
7960 : This duty is too much for just one to bear. If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived. It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.
7961 : That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.
7962 : Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis? I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.
7963 : Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm. I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.
7964 : C'mon, let's see a little excitement! This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.
7965 : It's not the Northlands this time. None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?
7966 : I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain. Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.
7967 : I thought this would be the end of you for sure... Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.
7968 : What, no words for an old friend? Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?
7969 : I betrayed you! I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia! The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!
7970 : Everything began thirty years ago. And there were things that came to an end... Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.
7971 : And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.
7972 : I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions. No matter who that person may be.
7973 : Raogrimm...
7974 : Are you sure you want to do this? This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land. As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...
7975 : Raogrimm. There is no need to suffer alone anymore. Our presence here should answer your question.
7976 : There are crimes that must be atoned for. And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.
7977 : Until the dawn of an age without hatred... No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.
7978 : Cornelia...
7981 : There is a strange symbol drawn here. A haunting chill sweeps through you as you gaze upon it...
7982 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Present the %...if you wish to pass into...my dream.
7983 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: The sands of time yet fall... Present the...%.
7984 : I am the ruler of Dynamis.
7985 : Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs? Either way, this is not your dream.
7986 : The dreamer of this realm is a separate entity than he who dreamt of that wasteland of malice, Xarcabard.
7987 : Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?
7988 : I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.
7989 : While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.
7990 : The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.
7991 : Search for my counterpart, and unite this realm with your own dream.
7992 : A nightmare curses this land yet again.
7993 : Take heed, dream traveler.
7994 : I have been watching your dream.
7995 : But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there. This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.
7996 : You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.
7997 : I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...
7998 : The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.
7999 : Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place... The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.
8000 : The entrance to the dream has already been opened. Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.
8001 : I am...a unique entity...
8002 : We are...comprised of all entities...
8003 : Intermingling with one another...dividing among each other...
8004 : And devouring one another...
8005 : The shadow that you defeated had been consumed by the dreamer of this realm.
8006 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who have come into contact with the Emptiness.
8007 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who came into contact with the Emptiness.
8008 : Could it have been that girl...? When I next see her, she will pay dearly.
8009 : Could it have been that girl...? No, there was one more, transformed after death...
8010 : Her malice will not perish as long as this dream continues, using my shadows to revive countless times.
8011 : You must confront the nightmare and continue to fight them to keep this realm from spreading.
8012 : The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness... Could it have been transferred to another girl...?
8013 : You know this girl well. I could take care of her easily, but if you wish me to spare her, then you will lend me your power.

8200 : A tragic age of darkness will reign. And yet, the gods will not wake from their slumber...

8202 : The lay of the ancient gods, a song never meant to reach mortal ears...
8203 : The strains of the forbidden verse have spilled over into our world, weaving themselves into the rush of the wind, the crash of the waves, and the heartbeats of every living being on Vana'diel.
8204 : It has already become one with us, never to return to its rightful time and place.
8205 : A single sound echoes, then echoes once more. What began as a whisper grows into a roar as it reverberates through time and space.
8206 : Don't you see, %? There's no turning back...not now.
8207 : The fate of mankind--of this very world--has been set in motion.
8208 : The lost song remains undiscovered.
8209 : There is a great and terrible battle still to be fought over this song... A battle that will see the love and hatred of the ancient gods shake this world to its very core.
8210 : A battle from which even you, %, will not return unscathed... But now is not the time for such talk. You will see for yourself...in due time.
8211 : Now, it is the echo of the ancient lay that has awakened to threaten the existence of our world. It must be silenced...at all costs.
8212 : You have already uncovered the secret lay of the sleeping gods, I see.
8213 : Could this be why the echo has grown so strong...?
8214 : No matter. The echo of the ancient ode already resonates throughout our world...
8215 : ...silent though it may be to mortal ears.
8216 : It is this echo that, left unchecked, will cast open the door to Paradise...
8217 : ...and unravel the very fabric of Vana'diel itself.
8218 : But what can be done? How are we to fight that which can be neither seen nor heard?
8219 : Perhaps there is a way...
8220 : The shards you brought here were not the only fragments of the crystal to fall from the heavens.
8221 : Perhaps the others hold the answers we seek.  Perhaps they will reveal to us how to save this world.
8222 : The %, the %, and the %... We must recover them, and quickly. Before they fall into the wrong hands...
8223 : If those nosy Goblins were to stumble across them, one can only imagine what effect the power of the crystal might have...
8224 : I'll be waiting for you here. And %...you'd better hurry.
8225 : With each passing moment, the echo grows stronger, ever closer to drowning out the sound of our very existence...
8226 : (debug flag) Finished Promathia? Nope. Sure did!
8227 : There you are, %. I've been waiting for you.
8228 : Were you able to recover the %, %, and %?
8229 : Ahhh...wonderful.
8230 : These shards are sure to tell us something. Let us see what secrets they hold...
8231 : What's this? There is another verse...?
8232 : An antiphon, a response to the lay of destruction...?
8233 : An undiscovered verse with the power to silence the raging echo...
8234 : A chorus with the power to channel the love, the will to live of all who sing it into a clarion call. A call that will cut through the echo of destruction, restoring order from chaos...
8235 : An ode to appease the ancient gods... Yes, this is the answer we seek.
8236 : You!
8237 : Meddling child! Why do you interfere?
8238 : Who do you think you are to defy the will of the Seed Crystal? To defy your own fate?
8239 : Hah! The Seed Crystal? It's nothing but an echo. A faint shadow of the past--
8240 : But child, do you not see? It is the echo of your own beating heart, of your own breath, of every life born to this world since the time of creation.
8241 : Within the echo, all are one--as it has been since before the dawn of time.
8242 : The echo of life will resound through the ages. It will not be silenced by the likes of you!
8243 : The Seed Crystal...its echo...they did not arise from nothingness... They were drawn to this world...by a song... A song...that rings out ceaselessly...from within a mother's heart...
8244 : Mortals...do you not see? You are dealing...with powers...far beyond your control.
8245 : The Seed Crystal, eh? So that oversized slab of rock has a name.
8246 : I had a hunch that following that crystal would lead me somewhere. Looks like this is where things start to get interesting...
8247 : Well met, %. I see you've still got a nose for trouble.
8248 : Now, what in Altana's good name is going on here?
8249 : And what were those overgrown bean sprouts blathering on about? A song within a mother's heart?
8250 : Ah.  So you must be Aldo...
8251 : Yes... You have your sister's eyes.
8252 : What!?
8253 : Boy! What did you say just now!?
8254 : Finally we meet...Uncle.
8255 : Mother named me Aldo too. After you...
8256 : Just one minute, kid! Are you saying your mom is my sister!?
8257 : That you're...Emeline's son?
8258 : My sister...still lives!?
8259 : I'm afraid we've no time to celebrate this family reunion now, Uncle.
8260 : We must unearth and release the antiphon...and quickly.
8261 : Before the ancient echo reduces our world to so many pieces of shattered crystal.
8262 : Luckily, you just may prove to be the key to it all...Uncle Aldo.
8263 : Yes. You just might be able to break the resonance between Mother and the Seed Crystal.
8264 : What nonsense is this!? What does Emeline have to do with this so-called Seed Crystal!? You expect me to believe this childish fantasy?
8265 : A fantasy? I think not, Uncle. No...there can be no doubt.
8266 : Can you not hear it? A prayer of life... Yes, this world must be saved...no matter how great the cost.
8267 : If you wish to save Mother...
8268 : If you care for the sister you once knew, make haste for Fei'Yin.
8269 : The servants of the Seed Crystal will not hesitate to put their dark schemes into action.
8270 : Hold it right there, boy!
8271 : I must know...where is Emeline!? What's been done to her!?
8272 : Oh, you'll have your answers soon enough...my dear Uncle.
8273 : What the--? Cursed brat! Seed Crystals and ancient songs!? This is all patently absurd!
8274 : But if the boy speaks true, and my sister truly still lives...
8275 : For all these years, I thought I had lost you forever that day. By the Goddess, I won't let them take you from me again. Emeline...
8276 : Fei'Yin, he said? I'd best be on my way.
8277 : And %, I trust you to keep quiet about what you've seen here today.
8278 : And you there, adventurer. I don't know who you are or what brings you here with that boy, but I trust you to keep quiet about what you've seen today.
8279 : If these unfounded claims of the world's end reached the three nations, we'd have nothing short of mass panic on our hands.
8280 : I intend to uncover what information I can, and suggest that you do the same. But until we find out if the boy's words hold water, we're not to speak a word of this--not even to one another.
8281 : Until we meet again...
8282 : (set debug flag) Acquainted with Aldo? We're best buds! Never met the guy.
8283 : Enter the battlefield for Gatherer of Light?
8284 : Enter the battlefield? Yes. No.
8285 : A field manual has been placed here by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.). Useful information pertaining to various topics on field operations fills its pages.
8286 : What will you do? Nothing. Read about individual training. Review current training regime. Cancel current training regime. Read about elite training. Read about field support.
8287 : Which page? I've changed my mind. Page 1. Page 2. Page 3. Page 4. Page 5.

11389 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11390 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
11391 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
11392 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
11393 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
11394 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
11395 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
11396 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
11397 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
11398 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
11399 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
11400 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
11401 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
11402 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
11403 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
11404 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
11405 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
11406 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
11407 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
11408 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
11409 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
11410 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
11411 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!

11415 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
11416 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
11417 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
11418 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
11419 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
11420 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
11421 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
11422 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
11423 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
11424 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
11425 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
11426 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
11427 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
11428 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
11430 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
11431 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
11432 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
11433 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
11434 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
11435 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
11436 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
11437 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
11438 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
11439 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
11440 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

11461 : And while introductions are utterly unnecessary on our part, We shall do so out of courtesy, from the goodness of our heart.

11463 : The first and eternal empress of the Shantotto Empire; in effect, its sturdy truss.
11464 : From this day forth all adventurers are our minions.
11465 : For all things beneath the heavens are under our dominion.
11466 : Now, as we are royally busy, we shall hop straight to the point. We commission you on your inaugural mission--do try not to disappoint!
11467 : Seek out the protocrystals that lie scattered across the land. Affix to them these enchanted seals as securely as you can.
11468 : Of the six we shall entrust you, three or more must be attached to their corresponding protocrystals; our brilliant plan shall then be hatched.
11469 : With the enchanted seals in place the crystals' power shall be amplified. Thence, we can expand our borders and conquer away 'til satisfied.
11470 : For she who controls the protocrystals and their energy controls the world. In every corner of Vana'diel our resplendent banner shall be unfurled!
11471 : Know that a reward awaits you upon the completion of your task. The amount is performance-based, if that's the question you would ask.

11473 : Our empire shall reign in glorious might--oh golly, what a thrill!
11474 : Carry out Shantotto's bidding? As you wish, my empress. I'll never join you!
11475 : Upon the completion of your mission, return here with all due haste. Be brave, stay strong, keep heart no matter what dangers you might face.

11479 : You have no say in this; disobedience will be met with termination.

11481 : M-M-Master!
11482 : A-a-another urgent letter has arrived from the self-styled Eternal Empress during your absence, kupo!
11483 : Let me read it to you this instant...
11484 : Aptly done, our minion, you ought to be commended, for amplifying the crystals' power exactly as we had intended.
11485 : Enclosed within the envelope is your reward as was discussed. The sum is performance-based, so you should find it not unjust.
11486 : No time to take a breather, though, the war effort will not wait. The next step involves securing funds to put food on our armies' plate.
11487 : Listen up and listen close, the master plan is thus: we usurp the Tenshodo and roll in dough without a fuss.
11488 : Your role in this, %, will be the secret assassination of the Tenshodo's young leader, Aldo; a critical operation.
11489 : To aid you on your way, preparations have already been made.
11490 : Aldo will soon arrive at the Gustav Tunnel, thanks to false information laid.
11491 : Your first stop, though, is Norg, so pray make a brief detour.
11492 : Speak with a man named Andrause, from him % you must procure.
11493 : With it in your hands, into the tunnel venture deep. And you should find the target will recognize you at a peep.
11494 : How the task is carried out is for you to decide.
11495 : When the deed is done you shall hear word from our side.
11496 : Undertake the assassination? As you wish, my empress. Do your own dirty work!
11497 : We pray for resounding success in this imperial undertaking.
11498 : For failure's reward is pain; the screams shall not require faking.
11499 : For the glory of the Empire and her empress most fair, be prepared to lose more than a few tufts of hair.
11500 : Dear, naive %, we have already had this conversation.
11501 : Are we clear, dear?
11502 : My, oh my...
11503 : The situation is hurtling out of control like a riderless chocobo, kupo.
11504 : Knowing you for the kind and just adventurer that you are, Master, you're not intending to assassinate Aldo. Am I right, kupo?
11505 : At any rate, Aldo is a man who listens to reason. I think it'd be wise to acquire the aforementioned % so you can meet him at the Gustav Tunnel and explain the situation, kupo.
11506 : In the meantime, I'll return to the Mog House and stay on standby should any more dastardly developments take place. Be safe, kupo!

11564 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11565 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11566 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11567 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11568 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11569 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11570 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11571 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11572 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11573 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11574 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11575 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11576 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11577 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11578 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11579 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11580 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11581 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11582 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11583 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11584 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11585 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11586 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11587 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11588 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11589 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11590 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11591 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11592 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11593 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11594 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11595 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11596 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11597 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11598 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11599 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11600 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11601 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11602 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11603 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11604 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.

11661 : Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.
11662 : Those who possess % may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused. Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.
11663 : Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
11664 : I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
11665 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Have stratum abyssite examined. Request teleportation. Analyze atmacite. Ask about atmacite. Ask about atmacite enrichment.
11666 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.
11667 : Infuse which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) Previous page. Next page.
11668 : Infusing the % (lv.#) requires # cruor.
11669 : Infuse % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
11670 : You do not have enough cruor.
11671 : [Infuse/Purge] which atmacite? None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#)
11672 : Purge % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
11673 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with % (lv.#)!
11674 : The atmacite could not be infused...
11675 : % has been purged of the % (lv.#).
11676 : % purges the % (lv.#), infusing % (lv.#) in its place. (Cruor expended: #)
11677 : You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.
11678 : Enrich which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # Previous page. Next page.
11679 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
11680 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
11681 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
11682 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
11683 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
11684 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11685 : The atmacite could not be purged...
11686 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
11687 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
11688 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
11689 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
11690 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11691 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
11692 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
11693 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
11694 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
11695 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
11696 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
11697 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
11698 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
11699 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
11700 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
11701 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
11702 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
11703 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
11704 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
11705 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
11706 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
11707 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
11708 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
11709 : Your % has evolved into %!
11710 : Supply me with the # cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.

12445 : I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the [Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana]. My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.
12446 : I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.
12447 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Ask a bunch of questions. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
12448 : While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess % may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
12449 : The % is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.
12450 : Enlisted in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s armed forces, you say? Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.
12451 : I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
12452 : While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel. Come back again once you have proven your worth.
12453 : You must be at least level # to participate in Voidwatch.
12454 : Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!
12455 : I see you've yet to be issued %. Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.
12456 : Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.
12457 : You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or jurisdiction.
12458 : Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.
12459 : While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with %.
12460 : Operations are presently underway at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
12461 : Operations are presently underway at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
12462 : Operations are presently underway at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
12463 : It would seem some other requirement exists besides the usual % and %.
12464 : Rest assured, you will be apprised of this information as soon as we acquire it.
12465 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].
12466 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg].
12467 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo].
12468 : When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension. The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.
12469 : Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!
12470 : Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.
12471 : The % you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.
12472 : You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
12473 : Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts. This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.
12474 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
12475 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.

Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
12477 : Operations are currently underway [in the greater Jeuno region/in the three nations]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
12478 : Ah, I daresay your % has undergone change!
12479 : How many would you like? None. Just one. Fill me up!
12480 : Here is your additional % allocation. Make each and every one count, you hear?
12481 : It appears you already possess the maximum allocation of # stones. I'm not authorized to provision you with more.
12482 : I'm afraid we're out of stock. The next shipment is expected to arrive in # [minute/minutes] (Earth time).
12483 : Obtained key item: # %!
12484 : Obtained key item: # %!
12485 : Your outstanding allocation of %? My records tell me you have # to your name.
12486 : Exchange for what? (Cruor: #) Nothing right now. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #.

12488 : # cruor is required for the %.
12489 : Proceed? (Required Cruor: #) Yes. No.
12490 : It seems you do not have enough cruor.
12491 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for %!
12492 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for the %!
12493 : Hm? It seems you already possess %. In that case, you won't be needing another.
12494 : This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.
12495 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.
12496 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.
12497 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.
12498 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.
12499 : A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.
12500 : A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.
12501 : A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
12502 : What will you ask about? Nothing. The Voidwalker threat. How I can do my part. The Voidwatch. Voidwatchers. Ascent items. Riftworn pyxides. %. Stratum abyssite. Planar rifts. Cruor. Abyssite. Voidstone consumption.
12503 : Voidwalker is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.
12504 : Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.
12505 : While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.
12506 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.
12507 : As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.
12508 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.
12509 : To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.
12510 : Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.
12511 : Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.
12512 : Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought. Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.
12513 : These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team. They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.
12514 : Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.
12515 : The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to # stones per person at any given time.
12516 : That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.
12517 : The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call Voidwalkers.
12518 : Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.
12519 : Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.
12520 : Possession of % is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
12521 : It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.
12522 : You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.
12523 : Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
12524 : In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.
12525 : The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.
12526 : When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.
12527 : Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.
12528 : However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.
12529 : Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.
12530 : Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.
12531 : But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the existential spectrum.
12532 : You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned. In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.
12533 : The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.
12534 : To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.
12535 : Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
12536 : Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.
12537 : One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items, while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.
12538 : Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.
12539 : All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.
12540 : Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.
12541 : For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.
12542 : In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.
12543 : Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.
12544 : If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.
12545 : Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company. It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.
12546 : Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.
12547 : Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.
12548 : Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.
12549 : % and % are representative of such items. They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.
12550 : (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)
12551 : They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.
12552 : Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.
12553 : Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.
12554 : Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.
12555 : Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding. But I digress...
12556 : Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.
12557 : As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch. Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.
12558 : It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.
12559 : Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong. Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.
12560 : Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.
12561 : The % is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.
12562 : Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.
12563 : The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.
12564 : I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.
12565 : I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.
12566 : Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?
12567 : Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.
12568 : Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them. Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!
12569 : And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.
12570 : I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really. Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.
12571 : As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray. Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...
12572 : Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.
12573 : Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing. There exists another: stratum abyssite.
12574 : Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite. Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.
12575 : Are you familiar with voiddust? Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.
12576 : As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch. Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.
12577 : The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust. Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me? Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.
12578 : At any rate, should you manage to obtain any voiddust in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me. Simple enough, wouldn't you say?
12579 : Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
12580 : Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.
12581 : If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.
12582 : Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land. The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
12583 : By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension.
12584 : Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.
12585 : Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.
12586 : Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.
12587 : Keep this fact in mind at all times.
12588 : It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.
12589 : If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...
12590 : Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
12591 : While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.
12592 : As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants. There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.
12593 : Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.
12594 : Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite. If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.
12595 : As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.
12596 : Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.
12597 : Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called periapt--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
12598 : Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.
12599 : Select where voidstones will be consumed from.
12600 : Set to which? Key items. Stock.
12601 : Voidstones will now be taken from [your key items/the stock].
12602 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here is your voidstone! Take it and use it well.
12603 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here are your voidstones! Take them and use them well.
12604 : It seems you already possess as many voidstones as you can carry. You'll want to hold on to that voiddust until you've depleted your supply.
12605 : How many do you need? (Cruor: #) None, thank you. One (# cruor). Three (# cruor). Six (# cruor). Nine (# cruor). Twelve (# cruor).
12606 : % obtains one % in exchange for # cruor.
12607 : % obtains # % in exchange for # cruor.

12616 : At attention, soldier! I've received an urgent alarum calling our best men to arms, and guess whose name is listed front and center? You're to report to Jeuno for further orders immediately.
12617 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me. Pick up those legs and get a move on!
12618 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me.
12619 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate in Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through.
12620 : Time is short, so pick up those legs and get a move on, soldier!
12621 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate just over there and one of our men will see you through.
12622 : Excellent work, %. You serve the Voidwatch well. Your presence has been requested in the Grand Duchy once more. Make your way there with all speed.
12623 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace.
12624 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
12625 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate at Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
12626 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
12627 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate over there and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
12628 : Where's your %, soldier? I'll need to see one before I can authorize your participation in the [Jeuno/Qufim] Voidwatch jurisdiction.
12629 : % are issued only to those brave men and women who have distinguished themselves in regional Voidwatch efforts.
12630 : Prove yourself capable in the three nations, and you can rest assured that your abilities won't go overlooked. Keep fighting the good fight, soldier!
12631 : Reporting for combat, are you? Yes, this % of yours appears to be in order. Welcome aboard!
12632 : I suspect you've already been briefed about the use of %, but protocol dictates that I ask if you are in need of a review. What will it be, soldier?
12633 : What will it be, soldier? Ready for battle, sir! I need a briefing, sir!
12634 : Now that's what I like to hear, soldier!

12729 : Guguoggha! Geh, gaggho!
12730 : Ugoh! Ugaggo, gaggago!
12731 : Guh, ugogo, ugoggu! Gagugga, ugah?
12732 : Gugoho! Ugagegga, gugugu!
12733 : Ugh! Are you even listening to us!?
12734 : Ah, it's the m-mighty %...
12735 : It's about time you showed up!
12736 : This Gigas kid has no idea what we're talking about!
12737 : We asked him about the monster that had the World Eater Egg at Delkfutt's Tower, but he doesn't believe us!
12738 : He says it's none of our business!
12739 : Well, apparently there was a purple dragon with a strange marking?
12740 : Hmm? A strange marking? And a purple dragon?
12741 : The one who brought the egg to the Quadav also had a strange marking, I think.
12742 : A-actually, that was someone who was r-resurrected in Valhalla, right?
12743 : Urk! What is that undead up to...
12744 : D-do you think it's trying to hide the egg again until it h-hatches?
12745 : Uran-Mafran's master...what was his name again? I'm sure that mage is involved somehow!
12746 : Y-yeah, his master's n-name was Garazu-Horeizu... R-right?
12747 : Is Garazu-Horeizu involved? Yes, indeed. No, I don't think so.
12748 : U-Uran-Mafran said his master was in Valhalla and that he was trying to b-bring him back to life.
12749 : The wandering about, the m-marking... Th-there was something about hypnosis magic too.
12750 : That's right! This is just getting worse by the moment!
12751 : Gaguuu! Ugogga, gegge, ugah!
12752 : Quiet, you! Yes, I know how annoying people can be!
12753 : Gugogga! Ugagugga!
12754 : Come on, just tell us what we want to know! Spit it out already!
12755 : Ugoh! Gugaaa, gegge!
12756 : Man, your breath absolutely reeks! I can't take much more of this!
12757 : Gugaaa! Gugohho, ugogguga!
12758 : Uh-oh. I think you made him angry. Gigas and Goblins don't get along very well.
12759 : I don't like where this is h-heading... I-if we lose this, he's probably g-gonna have us for lunch.
12760 : Gugohho! Gaggagugago!
12761 : One or more of your party members do not meet the prerequisites for this battle.
12762 : One or more of your party members are not in the appropriate staging zone.
12763 : One or more of your party members are currently viewing a cutscene.
12764 : Hey! Get rear in gear, everyone!
12765 : Urk... My legs...
12766 : Grrr....Rrraaah!
12767 : Ooof...That one hurt...
12768 : Try this one on for size!
12769 : Rrrrrr... Graaah!
12770 : Hey! S-settle down!
12771 : Uguuu, ugguguuu.
12772 : Well? Had enough? <Huff> <puff>
12773 : Gugaaa... Gagaga, ugagugga! Guddagu, gigeh, gaggagge!
12774 : He said he lost, so he's willing to listen to what we have to say.
12775 : It's about time... Well, what should we ask him?
12776 : L-let's see... I suppose we should ask what he knows about the e-egg.
12777 : Gegago, ugga, gueggo! Dodoga, ugah?
12778 : H-he says that the creature with the m-marking and the egg itself have always been at Delkfutt's Tower.
12779 : So does that mean the old fairy tale is actually true?
12780 : Wh-what fairy tale?
12781 : It's said that the powerful mage Delkfutt hid a dangerous egg within a great tower.
12782 : I-is that really true?
12783 : However, the part about such a massive tower being built so quickly is pretty hard to believe.
12784 : Th-that's part of the story too? I know they say that Delkfutt is a...
12785 : Okay, Echion has told me what we needed to know!
12786 : Not too long ago, a room for the World Eater Egg was found within Delkfutt's Tower.
12787 : However, the Gigas decided to keep that information from us.
12788 : And why is that!?
12789 : The Gigas weren't around five thousand years ago, so they had no idea just how dangerous Chaos was!
12790 : In fact, they say Chaos is a benevolent being who actually cleaned up the Middle Lands!
12791 : How could they think such a thing!?
12792 : W-well, I suppose I get what they're trying to say.
12793 : L-long, long ago, when the Tonberries weren't like we kn-know them today...
12794 : Oh boy, here we go...
12795 : Th-the world had collapsed, and s-suddenly everything changed...
12796 : Th-the land was covered in c-crystals, and not a single living thing could exist on its surface.
12797 : O-one day, however, a great w-winged creature appeared from the sky...
12798 : I-it devoured all of the c-crystals encasing the land.
12799 : E-eventually, this giant winged creature became the t-terrestrial avatar known as Chaos.
12800 : Nicely told, Dazbog!
12801 : Hmm? Is that really true?
12802 : M-Meebles know about the s-soil and the land beneath us as well as anyone.
12803 : So Chaos actually helped create the land as we know it today...
12804 : And because of that, various beings could be born and live here...
12805 : So maybe Chaos got tired of us and that's what motivated such actions.
12806 : Hey, it's not like we're just a bunch of weeds or something!
12807 : And afterwards, Chaos simply enjoyed a delicious feast.
12808 : D-delicious... Ah, that's it!
12809 : What's the matter!?
12810 : D-do we know how the egg was cracked open?
12811 : No, unfortunately not. Echion doesn't know anything about it either.
12812 : I-it's strange.
12813 : What exactly happened in Jeuno?
12814 : It's a waste of our precious time to just sit here and think about it. Let's go ask Muckvix!
12815 : Hey, you should come visit Muckvix with us too!
12816 : It seems you need to visit Muckvix in Lower Jeuno.
