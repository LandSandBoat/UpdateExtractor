6975 : [/I've gained a fair amount of experience./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./Hmm./I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level./I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./I've come a long way towards my next level./We've been busy, huh?/I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level.] [/I must be close to halfway to my next level by now./Can't slow down now!/I must be almost halfway to my next level by now./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!/That was much faster than I expected./No time to be slacking off!/Must be close to halfway by now./I think I'm almost halfway to my next level./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!]
6976 : I've gained a fair amount of experience. I must be close to halfway to my next level by now.
6977 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
6978 : Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
6979 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6980 : I think I'm about half way there...
6981 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6982 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6983 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
6984 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
6985 : I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.
6986 : We've been busy, huh? I think I'm almost halfway to my next level.
6987 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6988 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.
6989 : I'm halfway there...maybe?
6990 : [/Hmm./This is a good pace!/Hmm./Well, well./Just a little more./Come on!/I'm past the halfway point./Just a little more!/Well, well.] [/Not too much further to my next level./Not much more to my next level!/Still need a little more experience for my next level./It appears my next level is not far off at all./My next level is not too far away./I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!/Not long now until I gain another level./My next level is almost within sight!/It appears my next level is not far off at all.]
6991 : Hmm. Not too much further to my next level.
6992 : This is a good pace! Not much more to my next level!
6993 : Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
6994 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6995 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
6996 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
6997 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
6998 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
6999 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
7000 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
7001 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
7002 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7003 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
7004 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?
7005 : [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
7006 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
7007 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
7008 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
7009 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7010 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
7011 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7012 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7013 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7014 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7015 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7016 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7017 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7018 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7019 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7020 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7021 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7022 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7023 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7024 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7025 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7026 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7027 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7028 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7029 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7030 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7031 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7032 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7033 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7034 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7035 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7036 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7037 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7038 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7039 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7040 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7041 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7042 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7043 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7044 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7045 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7046 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7047 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7048 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7049 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7050 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7051 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7052 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7053 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7054 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7055 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7056 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7057 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7058 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7059 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7060 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7061 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7062 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7109 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7110 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7111 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7112 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7113 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7114 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7115 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7116 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7117 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7118 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7119 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7120 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7121 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7122 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7123 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7124 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7125 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7126 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7127 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7128 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7129 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7130 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7131 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7132 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7394 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
7395 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
7396 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7397 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7398 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7399 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7400 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7401 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7402 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7403 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7404 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7405 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7406 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7407 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7408 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7409 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7410 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7411 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7412 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7413 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7414 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7415 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7416 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7417 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7418 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7419 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
7420 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
7421 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
7422 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.
7423 : A mysterious power absorbs the malice!
7424 : Please select absorption value. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
7443 : The shining object is washed further downstream.
7444 : You see something shining.
7445 : Pick up shining object? Yes. No.
7446 : The shining object slips through your fingers and is washed further down the stream.
7447 : You see an inscription on the monument: Here rest the Great Palborough Pioneers. May Gustaberg's warm soil bring peace to their souls.
7448 : Lay Elki's % at the monument?
7449 : Lay down the %? Yes. No.
7450 : As you lay down the %, you find the names of those pioneers inscribed on the monument.
7451 : There you see ten names, including that of Elki's great-grandfather, Omran.
7452 : As you look closely, you find another, almost illegible name at the very bottom of the monument. The letters have almost worn away, and you can only make out Vig****t O**.
7453 : You can reach the water from here.
7454 : You see a message engraved on the stone:
7455 : As I passed through this area, I heard Bastokers were building a monument honoring the pioneers who dug the Palborough Mines. Being the curious type, I went to visit the site.
7456 : The site itself turned out to be an old cemetery, where the tombstones were so old, the names were worn away with age.
7457 : It turned out that the graves were those of numerous Galka who died in an accident the day the Metalworks was completed, in a time when Bastok was still struggling to become a nation.
7458 : I do not know if the Palborough Pioneers are the heroes people claim they are. I, for a fact, have no doubt the Galka who lie here gave their lives bravely to settle this arid, forsaken land.
7459 : I decided to spend a night here, drinking to the unnamed heroes of a forgotten time.   --Gwynham Ironheart, 749 Crystal Era.
7460 : What am I doing here? Oh, just business. Nothing you should worry about.
7461 : You've talked to my partner, I assume? Ah, but you don't meet the requirements. You must come here with a party of two or more members level fifteen and below.
7462 : You've talked to my partner, I assume? Stand in a line--let me see you all.
7463 : Okay, you check out. So, how was your trip here? Was it fun, or was it rough?
7464 : How was your trip here? Fun! Rough.
7465 : I see...that means people would not care to pay money to come here, then.
7466 : I see...so that means no one would want to come here, however good the sights may be.
7467 : Well, some details have to be smoothed out--something my partner isn't too good at--but it isn't a bad business idea. Here, take this, and thanks for coming.
7468 : There must be some money to be made with the sights here. It really isn't a bad idea...
7469 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
7470 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7471 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7472 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7480 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7481 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7482 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7483 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7484 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7485 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7486 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7487 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7488 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7489 : You've earned conquest points!
7490 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7491 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7492 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7493 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7494 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7495 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7496 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7497 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7498 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7499 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7500 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7501 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7502 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7503 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7504 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7505 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7506 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7507 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7508 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7509 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7510 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7511 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7512 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7513 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7514 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7515 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7516 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7517 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7518 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7519 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7520 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7521 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7522 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7523 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7524 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7525 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7526 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?

7528 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.

7530 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
7531 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.

7581 : What do you want? Would you cast Signet on me? I'd like to set my home point here. Nothing.
7582 : What do you want? Pay # gil and set my home point here. Nothing.
7583 : Your home point has been set.
7584 : You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.
7585 : I will set your home point here.
7586 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
7587 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
7588 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
7589 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
7590 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
7591 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
7592 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
7593 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
7594 : There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
7595 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.
7596 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
7597 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
7598 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
7599 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
7600 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
7601 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
7602 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...
7603 : Cancel your participation in the E.F. to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?
7604 : Quit the E.F.? Yes. Change locations. No.
7605 : Are you sure?
7606 : Really quit the E.F.? Yes. No.
7607 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
7608 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
7609 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
7610 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
7611 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
7612 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
7613 : You received # conquest points!
7614 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
7615 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
7616 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
7617 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
7618 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
7619 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
7620 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
7621 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
7622 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
7623 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
7624 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
7625 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
7626 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
7627 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
7628 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
7629 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
7630 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
7820 : PAUSE
7822 : Roar!
7823 : Grrroar!
7824 : Grrrgroooar! Grrrgroooarrr!
7825 : Grrroar! Grrrgroooar!
7826 : Groar! Grrroar!
7827 : Roar! Groar!
7828 : Roar!
7829 : Grrr...
7830 : Happy-wappy New Year to you, [sir/ma'am]! And apparently...commiserations!
7831 : Happy-wappy New Year to you, [sir/ma'am]! And apparently...a strong tiger has appeared in the north!
7832 : Oooh, you're sure to like this! He says, Beforrre me stands a person-werson who'll be swimming in fantarustic forrrtune this year!
7833 : Oooh, nice! He says, You're going be in for a grrreataru year with oodles of elation!
7834 : That was, Justaru the rrright amount of happiness is going to be coming your way!
7835 : That translates to, You win some, you lose some. But on the whole, there's no rrreason-weason why you should be pessimistic!
7836 : Uh-oh! That was, You'll need to dig deepy-weep for some luck of your own this yearrr!
7837 : Hrrrm... Rather than interpretaru that, let me just say, whatever happens this year, always rememberrr to keep your chinny-win up!
7838 : A fabulous-wabulous yearrr to you, adventurer!
7839 : Grrr... (Boy, it sure looks hungry.)
7840 : Grrr...Grrr... (It doesn't look like that was enough.)
7841 : Grrr! Grrr! Roar! (It looks quite satisfied.)
7842 : The [orange/1/2/3/red/red/blue/blue/yellow/yellow/green/green/indigo/indigo/violet/violet] light... I can feel its power run through me.
7843 : Come, %.  Follow me...
7844 : Carbuncle vanished off in the direction of the La Theine Plateau.
7845 : Carbuncle vanished off to another area in the La Theine Plateau.
7846 : The % jumps in your hands.
7847 : Ahahahahaha! I can sense the power of the ring! Get yourself moving [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7848 : Ahahahahaha! Don't slow down now, slacker! The readings are coming from the [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7849 : Ahahahahaha! You're getting close now! I can feel the ring's power from the next area!
7850 : Ahahahahaha! You're almost on top of it! It's somewhere in this area!
7851 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7852 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7853 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7854 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7855 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7856 : Now, listen close...
7857 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7858 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7859 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7860 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7861 : .........listen......
7862 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7863 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7864 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. As Thick as Thieves. The Gustaberg Tour. Apocalypse. An Ulcerous Uragnite(pt.1). An Ulcerous Uragnite(pt.2).
7868 : Hm? What is this? %? How do I know this is not some [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] trick?
7869 : Step back, adventurer! I've got much more important things to worry about now!
7870 : What!? A surprise attack by the beastmen!? And today, of all days...
7871 : In a matter of hours, a handful of new squires will be joining our ranks here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7872 : These young patricians are quite spirited, but they lack valuable battle experience.
7873 : While we need be cautious not to disgrace their family names, we cannot let them fall in battle. We request your assistance in protecting the future of San d'Oria!
7874 : It will not be long before a caravan of traders in search of new trade routes arrives here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7875 : If they were to be injured by the enemy, the economy of San d'Oria could fall into chaos. We request your assistance in protecting the prosperity of our kingdom!
7876 : A group of Temple Knights is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe our daily work.
7877 : Ah, but perhaps this could be a perfect chance to show those pampered sissies that being a true knight comprises more than just chasing about shoplifters and sweeping the chateau gardens. However, no matter how much of a grudge we may hold, we cannot let our Elvaan brothers and sisters fall in battle. Understood?
7878 : In a matter of moments, members of the Royal Guards will be arriving here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare us for our next campaign against the beastmen.
7879 : If the fiends are conniving a surprise attack, I expect you to do your best in assuring that no disgrace will be brought upon the guards' names, as well as preventing any unnecessary bloodshed.
7880 : Today, our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] is blessed with the honor of welcoming an ambassador from the fine Republic of Bastok.
7881 : If anything were to happen to our guest, it could transpire into war between our two nations. I expect you to protect the attach with your very life!
7882 : In a few moments, a new batch of legionary recruits will be enlisted to the Republican Army and dispatched here to the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7883 : However, within their ranks are future scientists and craftsmen. Their deaths would be a great loss for the future of our nation.
7884 : We must ensure their safety, but we also must be careful not to prevent them from fulfilling their duties. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
7885 : In a matter of minutes, a group of mariners will be arriving at our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] for self-defense training.
7886 : We must provide them with battle experience, but we also must ensure their safety. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
7887 : My sources indicate that a party of Gold Musketeers carrying supplies is approaching the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7888 : These soldiers are the best of the best, and more than likely will not require any assistance in the event of an attack. However, if anything were to happen to them...
7889 : Later today, a group of high-ranking officials from Strategic Command will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare for Bastok's next campaign against the beastmen.
7890 : If anything were to happen to the commanders, you and I would both be court-martialed! The Republic is counting on your assistance!
7891 : I have just received word that a group of ambassadors from the Federation of Windurst is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe what measures Bastok has undertaken to maintain stability in the regions under Republican control.
7892 : If the attachs were to be injured on this occasion, the damage suffered to our nations' relationship would be irreparable. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
7893 : Shortly, we will be conducting a test for our mercenary candidates here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7894 : This exam is to help us judge the candidates' skill in battle and help us separate those with talent from those who are bound for deskwork.
7895 : But after an attack by the beastmen...there won't be any candidates left to grade! You've got to help us give these kids a fighting chance!
7896 : It won't be long before a party of Federation scholars will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to do research on the local wildlife.
7897 : These scientists are more powerful with their pens than their swords...but that won't help them against a beastman attack! You've got to help us protect them!
7898 : Hmmm... Later today, a small group of Wize Wizards will be arriving to observe our daily work here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
7899 : I say that we give them something to remember! %! It's up to you to prove to those bigwigs that we are the ones who maintain the peace in the Federation! Give those beastmen all you've got! (Just don't let the Wize Wizards get hurt...)
7900 : Today, a party of Federation Patriarchs is scheduled to arrive at the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to plan for Windurst's next campaign against the beastmen.
7901 : If anything were to happen to them, we'd all be reassigned to latrine duty! If you know what's good for you, you won't let anyone lay a finger on them!
7902 : Oh, why did the military attachs from San d'Oria have to come to our outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] now?
7903 : I shudder to think what would happen if an ambassador was injured...or worse! Get out there and protect those Elvaan with your life!
7904 : Excellent work! Your efforts helped protect the future of our nation. Divide this among your companions.
7905 : Our nation suffered an enormous loss today. We must begin reinforcing our defenses immediately!
7906 : Your inability to complete the mission has led to our defeat. The last thing our nation needs is an incompetent adventurer!
7907 : You fought hard, and you proved yourself worthy. You are a great asset to the nation.
7908 : We commend you on your services in helping us avert the beastmen's attack. I do not see them attacking us again any time soon.
7909 : This area is currently conducting a Ballista match. I have no time to trouble myself with your beastman trinkets.
7910 : A party member has an NPC called up. You cannot take part in this event.
7911 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7912 : You hear a voice from out of nowhere...
7913 : You obtain # %!
7914 : ... At last we meet.
7915 : I have been freed from my prison and can soak up the sweat and blood of this world once more.
7916 : Wait, there is something I must...
7917 : This place is...?
7918 : I see... You must be the new wielder for these.
7919 : Yes, with your fighting spirit I believe you will be able to master the %.
7920 : The % have long accompanied me, along both rough and gentle paths. It is not easy to give them up, but...here.
7921 : They belong to you now. I ask that you consider my... Ah, but that is past now. I bid you farewell....
7922 : ...
7923 : I hope you don't think this is the end.
7924 : Your real life as a martial artist is just beginning. Time to start your training anew!
7925 : ... Finally! We finally meet face to face!
7926 : I have a presence in this world again! What an exhilarating feeling!
7927 : Ah yes, there is one more thing...
7928 : Eh? What?
7929 : Oh. You must be this one's new owner.
7930 : With your dagger skills, you'll make a perfect wielder for the %.
7931 : It is most difficult to give up a weapon that has seen me through so many tight spots, but you have earned it.
7932 : Treat her well...
7933 : ...
7934 : Splendid! From this day forth, I belong to you.
7935 : So, what kind of games shall we play? And where shall we go to play them? Who are we going to kill when we get there? It's all just too exciting...!
7936 : ... Thou hast found me.
7937 : I have now thrice shown my true form in this world.
7938 : A moment...
7939 : ... What has happened to me?
7940 : I see, you are the sword's new owner?
7941 : Well, this is most encouraging! A master of swordplay such as yourself should have no trouble wielding %.
7942 : When the world lies in chaos, this blade appears before the one meant to wield it. It is yours... Restore order to Vana'diel!
7943 : And now I, too, can rest unburdened...
7944 : ...
7945 : Thou art blessed this day.
7946 : Henceforth, I shall be thy blade. For the sake of thy companions, for justice in this world, wield my power in the name of honor...
7947 : ... You have found me.
7948 : Allow me to show my respect. You who have gained the strength of so many must be a true hero.
7949 : But first...
7950 : Who are you?
7951 : This must be some sort of joke. You are the new wielder of this weapon?
7952 : Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you. With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.
7953 : However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.
7954 : Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind. My regards go with you, stranger...
7955 : ...
7956 : Now, my heroic master...
7957 : For what purpose will you wield my power? The choices before you are without limit. Will you become the ruler of this world? Or perhaps...
7958 : ... You...me, meet.
7959 : Me...free... Thanks to you. Me, your...
7960 : Wait...
7961 : What the...?
7962 : Ah, now I see. The wheel has turned.
7963 : Truthfully spoken, I am thankful. % is a splendid axe, but ever does it hunger.
7964 : I have taken many lives to sate its need, and have reached the end of my strength.
7965 : You have my gratitude. You have freed me from my nightmare, and now I can sleep with a tranquil spirit...
7966 : ...
7967 : You, master, me. Good, work. Me, thank, you.
7968 : Master, me, hunger. Go, hunt? Find, prey? Me, cut, flesh. Break, bone. Drink, blood. Master, me, hunger...
7969 : ... Ah, you found me!
7970 : I have been freed from a world where life and death, reality and illusion are impossible to tell apart. I am truly grateful.
7971 : One moment...
7972 : ... This is...Jeuno!? Have I finally returned?
7973 : I... Nobody can see me. This is merely a reflection of reality. Which means you are the one to inherit the axe.
7974 : Hmm. With your polished skills, you will make a fine master for %.
7975 : The one who wields this axe must also be beautiful to look upon. Apparently, I was a suitable candidate. Do you not agree?
7976 : Congratulations. I expect you to perform great deeds from this day onwards. I also ask that someday you use % to avenge the Hydra Corps...
7977 : ...
7978 : I congratulate you also...my new master.
7979 : Now hold me high and let my blade glint in the sunlight! Let your friends, as well as your enemies, feast upon my glorious beauty!
7980 : ... You have found me.
7981 : My forbidden power is now yours, and I am liberated from my prison.
7982 : You have but to gain her respect...
7983 : Such a long dream I was having...
7984 : It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world. No. I must accept that it was no dream.
7985 : And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did... It seems you have already found your way to %.
7986 : Very well, I will pass it on to you. But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.
7987 : And think long and hard on whether or not this power should be used. Do not end up like me...
7988 : ...
7989 : Heh. Heh heh. Hahahahahahaha!
7990 : Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power? There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...
7991 : ... You have unearthed me at last.
7992 : I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.
7993 : All that remains is...
7994 : Hello? Is it possible that I...
7995 : But, no. I have not returned to this realm... You. You are to be my successor?
7996 : You certainly seem to have the required skill with the lance. Enough to convince % to lend you its power, at any rate.
7997 : Having this spear on the battlefield makes you a match for almost any opponent.
7998 : Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used. You have my admiration, adventurer. You have done well...
7999 : ...
8000 : The ceremony of inheritance is complete.
8001 : It is time for you to go forth and experience my overwhelming strength...
8002 : ... I have been rediscovered at last.
8003 : Thanks to you, I have made my escape from the shrouded land.
8004 : You must now gain the sanction of my master...
8005 : It is a pity, indeed.
8006 : This day has come far too soon for my liking.
8007 : However, you are a master of the ninja trade. I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the %.
8008 : Take this blade as your own. Travel far down the path of the ninja.
8009 : I will be watching you from the shadows...
8010 : ...
8011 : A fine master...
8012 : My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...
8013 : ... This day has finally come.
8014 : I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age. Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?
8015 : In any event...
8016 : What is going on here?
8017 : Ah, my successor has come.
8018 : I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the % and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.
8019 : When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.
8020 : You have my gratitude. Farewell, %...
8021 : ...
8022 : It has been a hard path to reach this point.
8023 : But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun. You have yet to attain perfection. Let us continue your training...
8024 : ... At long last, you have arrived.
8025 : I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...
8026 : You have proven me wrong...
8027 : I have heard of your coming.
8028 : You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?
8029 : Every time % is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor. I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.
8030 : However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now.  If you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.
8031 : Now, take the hammer and go! Just be careful with how you handle it. Do not let its might crush you as well...
8032 : ...
8033 : My might is yours to wield.
8034 : Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...
8035 : ... So, you have found me.
8036 : I must give you my thanks. I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.
8037 : And now...
8038 : Hwaah!
8039 : Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.
8040 : Well, it's for the best, I suppose. In my current state, % is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.
8041 : I entrust this staff to you! Take up %, %, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!
8042 : I take my leave of you now. I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...
8043 : ...
8044 : I am yours to wield.
8045 : But you are not yet my master. By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...
8046 : ... You have discovered my resting place.
8047 : The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more. My thanks.
8048 : Ah, one more test of your patience...
8049 : Where is this place?
8050 : Of course. How could I forget. I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.
8051 : Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary. % will fit snugly into your sure grasp.
8052 : However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke. You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.
8053 : Farewell...
8054 : ...
8055 : It is an honor to be owned by a just master. Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.
8056 : You are now the one to draw me in battle. I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.
8057 : ... We finally meet.
8058 : I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.
8059 : But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...
8060 : Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep. Oh, this place looks familiar...
8061 : Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?
8062 : You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And % would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...
8063 : Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.
8064 : This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...
8065 : ...
8066 : A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.
8067 : Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...
8068 : ... I am saved.
8069 : Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!
8070 : A few more moments, if you please...
8071 : Hello there. I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.
8072 : You've never heard of me? Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.
8073 : To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the %, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.
8074 : But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.
8075 : She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...
8076 : ...
8077 : He was a wonderful performer.
8078 : Let us be on our way. Our tour of the world has only just begun...

8124 : Enter the garrison? Yes. No.
8125 : The % is ripped violently to pieces!
8126 : Greetings, fair traveler. My people would entreat thy assistance, and offer rich reward in return. Thou shouldst speak with my sister Callisto, who abides in Grauberg's Witchfire Glen.
8127 : Hark! Our foe lurks thither. How wouldst thou proceed?
8128 : How will you proceed? Withdraw. Charge in. Scout the enemy. Check weapon.
8129 : Our foe advances...may thine aim be true!

8195 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8196 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip the %, kupo!

8198 : Time elapsed: # [hour/hours] (Vana'diel time) # [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] (Earth time)
8199 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
8200 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!
8201 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8202 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip % or %, kupo!
8203 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
8204 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
8205 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
8206 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
8207 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
8208 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
8209 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
8210 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
8211 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
8212 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
8213 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
8214 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!

8217 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8218 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
8219 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8220 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
8221 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
8222 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
8223 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
8224 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
8225 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
8226 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
8227 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
8228 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
8229 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.
8230 : KILL
8235 : Kupo-whoa-whoa there, pardner! Care to saddle up and help us rustle up a couple o' wild buffalo? 'Cause we've got a stampede on our hands, I reckon!
8236 : Lend a hand? <Skedaddle away.> A stampede, you say? I reckon I will.
8237 : Well, sit down and grab a sarsaparilla, and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. You see, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) ain't too popular among the townsfolk these days, and they've been talkin' with their wallets by not sendin' too many gold nuggets our way, if you catch my drift.
8238 : But seein' as how we moogles are an enterprisin' bunch, we done hatched ourselves a plan, y'hear?
8239 : A plan we call... The Buffalo Bonanza Ranch! Yeeeeee-hawww!!!
8240 : Rustle up a herd of the most darn-tootin' fearsome buffalo from over and yonder, throw a fence around 'em, and you done got yerself the rip-roarin'est dude ranch this side of the Rio Rafeloux, kupo!
8241 : Set up a saloon on the side serving scrumptious buffalo burgers, and you've got contented customers filling our moogle coffers with mucho dinero... Comprende?
8242 : That there was the plan, pardner.
8243 : So we lassoed up a herd o' ill-tempered buffalo from the mountains up north, and were leadin' our li'l dogies back this-a-way to town...
8244 : And that's when we hit a bit o' a snag.
8245 : Dagnabbit if I know where they came from, but a swarm of confounded chigoes done showed up!
8246 : Now y'see, these buffalo come from the mountains, and ain't never seen the likes of no chigoes before. They raised a right ruckus, and next thing y'know, we done had a stampede on our hands!
8247 : Y'ever see a stampedin' buffalo? Even our moogle hypnosis did 'bout as much good as a poke in the ear with a rusty cattle prod, kupo!
8248 : That's where you come in, pardner. What say you saddle up and help us moogles round up these beasties?
8249 : For each buffalo you capture, we'll give you one o' these here bovine brands. Collect 'em and mount 'em and you'll be eligible to win a veritable bonanza o' special prizes!
8250 : looks at you with puppy-dog eyes...
8251 : Now, I'd do this myself and save y'all the trouble, but jus' look at me... One kick from a stampedin' buffalo and my puny moogle body'd be flung right to the other side o' Vana'diel, I reckon!
8252 : Y'all got nothin' to worry 'bout, though. As big and sturdy as you are, I reckon you'd only fly to just over yonder a-ways.
8253 : And as an added bonus, you can trade the bovine brands you've earned for a whole kit 'n caboodle o' Buffalo Bonanza Ranch goods and prizes! Yeeeeee-haw, kupo!
8254 : So how's about it, pardner?
8255 : gazes at % with a steely glint in his eye.
8256 : Saddle up? I think I'll pass. Sure. Yeee-haw!
8257 : Yippie ki-yi-yay!!! Much obliged, pardner!
8258 : If your cow-herdin' skills are up to the task, we'll stamp you some bovine brands on this here sheet.
8259 : Once you've racked up your share o' brands, just mosey back on over here to claim your prizes!
8260 : So sharpen your spurs, and when you're ready, herd up the buffalo and lead them to the moogle cowhand in area [G-9/I-8/G-9/H-9/H-6/I-7], kupo!
8261 : Ready to go? Tell me more about the buffalo. How about some help, pardner? Giddy-up!
8262 : All right, now go rustle yerself up some buffalo! Yee-haw!
8263 : The big beastly ones are the bulls, the bosses o' the herds. The midsized ones are the mother cows, and the li'l-bittiest ones are the baby calves.
8264 : The calves are sweet little thangs. Don't even have to hypnotize 'em; they'll follow their mother's scent just 'bout anywhere.
8265 : By the by, we got ourselves a bottle o' Eau de Buffalo here. We moogle cowpokes use it to disguise ourselves with the mother buffalo's scent. It's only got #  [dose/doses] left, but they're all yours, pardner.
8266 : 'Course, there ain't no need to fret if it runs out. Just brush yerself up against one of the mama cows and you'll get a natural shot of Eau de Buffalo just like that.
8267 : But you'd best be careful, 'cause they be some hot-tempered heifers, y'hear? You'll be wantin' to sneak up on them from behind, all careful-like, to avoid their charge.
8268 : As for the bulls, I'm quakin' in my boots just thinkin' 'bout 'em. They're the nastiest, most foul-tempered beasts this ol' cowhand's ever laid eyes upon.  You'll be wantin' to steer clear of 'em and stick to roundin' up the cows and calves, kupo.
8269 : And don't you be forgettin' that these buffaloes, they always act as a herd, y'hear? So don't go mixin' the herds, or we'll have a right ruckus on our hands.
8270 : And you'd best take care to keep the chigoes away, too. One li'l bite from them and the buffalo will really start goin' loco, I reckon.
8271 : With this here bottle o' Eau de Buffalo, we can make you smell just like one o' the buffalo mamas. It's runnin' low, though, so you'll want to be usin' it wisely, I reckon.
8272 : Apply the scent? Not now. Sure.
8273 : A dab or two o' buffalo sweat, a dab or two o' milk, and...kupo!
8274 : You now smell strongly of buffalo!
8275 : There [is/are] # remaining dose[/s] of Eau de Buffalo.
8276 : Sorry, pardner, we done exhausted our supply. Reckon you'll just have to do it the hard way...
8277 : That's a cryin' shame, pardner.
8278 : If'n you change your mind, just holler. We'll be here 'till the cows come home.
8279 : The buffalo scent is about to wear off!
8280 : The buffalo scent has worn off!
8281 : Well, I'll be darned...you done rustled yerself some buffalo! Giddy on up, 'cause the Buffalo Bonanza Ranch is back in business!
8282 : You got # bovine  [brand/brands] stamped on your %! Yeee-haw!
8283 : Tarnation! If you ain't the greatest buffalo herder this ol' cowpoke's ever seen! You've earned yerself some extra brands, pardner.
8284 : You've wrangled yerself the following buffalo, pardner:
8285 : % %
8286 : % %.
8287 : Feelin' a bit tuckered out? You ain't caught yerself a single buffalo yet.
8288 : Ain't got the time for that now, pardner... We've got a stampede on our hands! We'd be much obliged if you could help us rustle up these buffalo, pardner. Go talk to my compadre by the city gates if yer interested.
8289 : Sorry, pardner, but you ain't earned enough bovine brands for that.
8290 : How goes it, pardner? Keep on herdin'. Ask about the buffalo. Get the mother's scent. Mosey on home.
8291 : So long, pardner. We've still got ourselves some loose buffalo, so do come back again, y'hear?
8292 : You've got yerself # bovine  [brand/brands], pardner.
8293 : Trade in for a prize? Not now. % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands).
8294 : Trade # brands for %? No thanks. Giddy-up!
8295 : Here we've got a special beverage made from buffalo milk, with a dash o' moogle magic. Darned if I know how it works, but one swig o' this and you'll up and transform into any critter you touch. You'll be best buddies with the buffalo in no time, pardner!
8296 : This here's a belt crafted from the finest buffalo rawhide, soaked in buffalo milk, and left to dry out under the burnin' sun.  Got a bit of a foul odor, but it works just like %.
8297 : With this here stylish mantle, not only will you be the most dashin' cowhand for miles, you'll be able to dodge those blasted buffalo charges a couple'a times, to boot!
8298 : This here's a limited-edition Buffalo Bonanza Ranch cowhorn. It's just a li'l decorative doodad, so it don't make no sound, but word has it that it can make you as rich as a gold mine!
8299 : Handle this hot and heavy new waist attire straight from the heavy horns of the belligerent buffalo Toro himself!
8300 : Handle this hot and heavy new waist attire straight from the heavy horns of the belligerent buffalo Miura himself!
8301 : Our wonderful workers of hide have fashioned this fantastic cap that can turn you into a buffalo calf, kupo!
8302 : There's big trouble, kupo! Our most reliable moogle intelligence reports that an odious one-eyed demon known as a Pyracmon is using the Harvest Festival masquerade as a cover and trying to infiltrate the city even as we speak!
8303 : We've been trying to warn people, but the bigwigs and guardsmen won't even give us poor little moogles the time of day. But you believe us...don't you, kind adventurer?
8304 : Help a moogle in need? But of course! I think I'll pass.
8305 : <Sigh> And here I had a devilishly delightful Harvest Festival costume handmade just for you... Oh well, looks like it's going back in storage until next year, kupo.
8306 : Splendid, kupo! The first thing you'll need to do is eliminate the Pyracmon's malevolent minions, the wraith bats!
8307 : These dastardly critters attacked us and sucked the moogle magic right out of us, kupo! Without it, even the sharpest steel won't so much as scratch the Pyracmon!
8308 : For each bat you banish, we'll recover some of our magical powers, so lay waste to as many flying foes as you can muster!
8309 : Report back here after that, and we'll channel that magic and whip up an incantation that will allow you to vanquish the Pyracmon!
8310 : In the meantime, I'll use the meager remains of our magic to enchant you with a spell to aid in your battle against the wraith bats, kupo.
8311 : There you go!  Now have at those winged vermin!
8312 : Back to help us rid the land of the vile Pyracmon?
8313 : Need help with anything? Just say the word, kupo!
8314 : Ask the moogle for help? I'm fine, thanks. I'm ready to take on the Pyracmon. I give up.
8315 : Wow, looks like you managed to recover oodles of magic from those bats. Oodles, kupo! This should make for a potent incantation indeed!
8316 : Mind you, this enchantment won't last forever; if it runs out, you'll need to nab some more magic from the bats again. Now go send that ghastly Pyracmon back to the foul depths whence it came!
8317 : Well, I'm sure a mighty adventurer like you has better things to do than help a poor little Moogle, kupo... Still, the Pyracmon won't rest until he's carried out his nefarious deeds, so do come back if you have a change of heart!
8318 : Wow, you made mincemeat out of that Pyracmon! Just watching the battle sent chills up my little wings, kupo! You're the savior of the town and of all mooglekind!
8319 : Though it may be unworthy of a great hero such as yourself, please accept this as a humble token of our moogle gratitude!
8320 : For all we know, the Pyracmon is still lurking, just waiting for another chance to creep into our ranks. Should it return, please lend us your strength again, kupo!
8321 : By the by, have you heard that some eerie and enchanting effulgences have emerged around the realm, kupo?
8322 : Each one mumbles and mutters like a misanthropic miscreant, but pay them no mind. Well now, may mirth and merriment multiply for you during this celebratory season, kupo!
8323 : My, my, my... What an intriguing spell you've learned, wayfarer.
8324 : Yi-yi-yikes! Another pernicious puppet of Pyracmon is poised to pulverize us, kupo!
8325 : Pyracmon? Hmm, that moniker may be gathering dust in the corner of my mind, but I do still recall it...possibly from some brittle tome written eons ago.
8326 : It's the exorcist who made a deal with a de--
8327 : Yes, yes, yes...now I remember. It is the name of a youthful yet promising exorcist who formed a perilous pact with a demon, only to become one himself.
8328 : An exorcist who...hey! Don't put the chocobo before the cart! I don't remember selling my soul to a demon like that ecclesiastical abomination!
8329 : Of course, but let us not dwell on trifling details. You there, adventurer. How about bestowing that boon upon us in a deal of your own? We shall certainly make it worth your while.
8330 : Ay yai yai! I ardently advise against accepting an appeal as artful as this, kupo! You sobbed sanguineous streams in your quest to procure this potent magic--you shouldn't just give it away!
8331 : Bestow the boon upon yon bats? Verily. Nay.
8332 : How thoughtful of you to grace us with your presence--and your magic--yet again.
8333 : I've never seen anyone go about business as slow as you! Was your mother a tortoise or something? Anyway, hurry up and give us that magic effect before we die of old age!
8334 : That spell...equivalent to # mandragora-power... We must have it.
8335 : What an exhilarating sensation! That last batch of magic was as potent as an Ahriman in rut. Should you chance to find yourself with a sorcerous abundance again, we will always welcome you with spread wings.
8336 : I just know you're holding out on us, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...for now. Next time, try stocking up on more of that magic first.
8337 : I knew you'd give us what we needed. Have this in return.
8338 : Sordid scryers, %! You just parted ways with all the magnificent magic you managed to muster, kupo!
8339 : Well...I suppose there's still some enhancing magic left to help you rout those reprobate wraith bats... Let's get back to business before that brutish Pyracmon can ruin the rest of the Harvest Festival, kupo.
8340 : I am literally spellbound, adventurer! Your contributions have surpassed our expectations. Take this as thanks from the bottom of our black hearts.
8341 : It turns out the energy contained in these so-called Middle Lands isn't so middling after all. At least it'll be of use once our preparations are underway.
8342 : Indubitably. While we must bid farewell to this continent, you can always use that headgear to fly over for a reunion.
8343 : Hyah, hyah, hyah! How gullible you are! You may be well versed in the arts of magic, but your sense of humor still leaves much to be desired.
8344 : ...Until next time.
8345 : What in the wide world was with those bizarre bats, kupo? I assumed they were allies of that apocalyptic abomination Pyracmon, but it seems my intuition was incorrect...
8346 : But based on the variety of their vexing vocal vibrations, I'd say there were three theurgists controlling those preternatural parasites. All that's beside the point, I suppose. Now we've got to start over from scratch, kupo...
8347 : This trace amount leaves our thirst for magic unquenched. The pact cannot be completed unless you return with the ordained measure.
8348 : What do you expect us to do with these spectral dregs!? This is nothing! Nothing! Don't come back here again until you've obtained an amount decent enough to study!
8349 : Your total...only equivalent to # mandragora-power... We require more...
8350 : How...disappointing. Then I shall take your reply to mean you do not require a certain miraculous artifact we had been saving for you.
8351 : ...Fine! See if I care! In fact, I care so little that I'm gonna put a curse on you for refusing to help us, so there!
8352 : ...Of course you won't now...but you will eventually.
8353 : Whew, for a moment I was positively petrified about your progression on this particular peregrination. Now that that's that, though, let's go pummel Pyracmon, puko! Er, kupo!
8354 : Such arcane power could be put to much more productive uses than banishing that fairy tale of an exorcist...
8355 : Should you take the time to charge that spell once more, we would certainly make it worth your while.
8356 : Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, yet you cannot help but feel ill at ease...
8357 : Kupopopo!? According to my observations, some occult object has emerged next to that eerie effulgence. Whatever could it be, kupo?
8358 : A field manual has been placed here by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.). Useful information pertaining to various topics on field operations fills its pages.
8359 : What will you do? Nothing. Read about individual training. Review current training regime. Cancel current training regime. Read about elite training. Read about field support.
8360 : Which page? I've changed my mind. Page 1. Page 2. Page 3. Page 4. Page 5.
8361 : The information on this page instructs you to defeat the following:

11461 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11462 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
11463 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
11464 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
11465 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
11466 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
11467 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
11468 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
11469 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
11470 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
11471 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
11472 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
11473 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
11474 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
11475 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
11476 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
11477 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
11478 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
11479 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
11480 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
11481 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
11482 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
11483 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!
11484 : Choose a location: West Ronfaure. East Ronfaure. La Theine Plateau. Valkurm Dunes. Jugner Forest. Batallia Downs. North Gustaberg. South Gustaberg. Konschtat Highlands. Pashhow Marshlands.

11486 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there, kupo!
11487 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
11488 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
11489 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
11490 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
11491 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
11492 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
11493 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
11494 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
11495 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
11496 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
11497 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
11498 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
11499 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
11500 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
11502 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
11503 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
11504 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
11505 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
11506 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
11507 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
11508 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
11509 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
11510 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
11511 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
11512 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

11561 : Oh my... That stone in your hand... Could it be...%?
11562 : Is it as the Tarutaru says? You've got rapier eyes, friend. Sorry, but you're mistaken.
11563 : Hehehe, they do say that it takes one to know one. No, waitaru... I mean, I'm no stranger to the stones, you know.
11564 : Mistaken-shmishtaken! I know a traverser stone when I see one! I've got a few of the pretties myself, you know.
11565 : Anyhow, with that revelation, everything falls nicely into place. You're %, and no mistaky-wake about it!
11566 : The stranger bears down on % with a penetrating gaze.
11567 : Hrmmm... By the looks of you, you've made the journey-wourney before.
11568 : Ah, before I go on, let me introduce myself. My namey-wame's Rurukaka, and it's an absolute pleasure to meetaru you!
11569 : Doubtless you've already figured it out, but I'm a native of Abyssea. It's a stroke of lucky-wuck that we were able to meet here and now.
11570 : I was just about to cross back over when you showed up, you see. Just quietaruly, but one of the few pluses of returning-wurning to Abyssea is the sweet release from the discomfort of devivification.
11571 : You do know about devivification, rightaru? How Abysseans suffer from a halving of strengthy-wength coupled with an unbearable chafing sensation when journeying to this dimension?
11572 : Unfortunately, there's no known way to suppress the effectaru. But a teensy-weensy bit of pain is the least we must endure for the sake of our world.
11573 : Ah, but I do ramble-wamble.
11574 : Seeing as how you've come here in full knowledge of the situation-wation, I'll share with you some importantaru information.
11575 : Beside the cavernous maw before you, another can be found here in North Gustaberg. The latter-watter, however, is as solid as a stiff and holds no interestaru for us. Feel free to ignore it.
11576 : So, this leaves us with the maw here, which curiously doesn't lead to the North Gustaberg of Abyssea. Step through, and instead you'll find yourself in nearby Grauberg, an area that's become inaccessible in your world.
11577 : Have you ever heardy-weard of Grauberg? It's a place steeped in mystique, said to be the home of some ancientaru wyrm deity.
11578 : Now, nobody-wody knows for sure why this maw isn't connected to the corresponding location in Abyssea.
11579 : The brainier types would have us believe dimensional misalignmentaru is the cause, but it makes no difference in practice.
11580 : Justaru keep in mind that this maw leads to Grauberg, and you'll be rightaru as rainy-wain!
11581 : That is, as long as you don't run afoul of the many terrible-werrible beasts that prowl the valleys and woodlands over yonder.
11582 : So terrible-werrible are they, in fact, you'd be forgiven for not wanting to pay them a visit. No one's forcing you to go, aftaru all.
11583 : ...
11584 : Judging by your flinty-winty expression, it seems you've already made up your mind. If you must go, then I wish you the bestaru of luck.
11585 : Before you dive into that floating gullet-wullet, though, there's just one more thing you should know.
11586 : I'm assuming you have experience with uragnites, those massive but gentle bivalves common-wommon to the warm waters of the south. Well, a specimen has somehow managed to scuttle its way over to Grauberg.
11587 : Taken by curiosity, my companions and I approachy-woached it, thinking it harmless. But we were quickly made to learn the error of this assumption to our grievous sorrow-worrow.
11588 : It came after us, %, murder burning in its bloodshotaru eyes. I managed to escape with my life, but my comrades didn'taru fare so well.
11589 : The creature is downrightaru frightful, even among the hordes of fell beasts that now inhabit Grauberg. Should you have the ill fortune of crossing paths with the fiendy-wiend, don't even think about playing hero.
11590 : To you, all of this might seem like just another day's adventuring, but you're the lightaru of hope for the people of Abyssea. Promise me you won't go throwing your life away like a stacky-wack of pebbles, okay?
11591 : Jeepers, won't you look at the time! I had bettaru get a move on, else I'll get forcibly-worcibly expelled!
11592 : A pleasure-weasure talking to you, %! Be safe in your travels!
11593 : Hello there, %. You've been keeping busy since we lastaru spoke.
11594 : Word of your courageous-wageous exploits has already reached my ears. Not once did I dream that anyone--not even one of your world--could slay that fearsome fiend!
11595 : I underestimated you, %, and by no small margin at that. To you, my words of warning mustaru have rung as hollow as an empty-wempty keg!
11596 : Now one less menace-wenace remains to terrorize the people of Grauberg.
11597 : And we owe it all to you, %. Thank you from the bottom-wottom of my heart.
11598 : This is hardly enough to show you the extentaru of my gratitude, but I want you to have it anyway.
11599 : %.
11600 : It's a rare variety of abyssite, said to be attuned to folk of this dimension. What its effectarus are, though, I'll leave the joy of discovery to you.
11601 : Your deedy-weeds have inspired the survivors, fanning the guttering flame of their resolve. I hope that you'll continue being the lightaru of hope for my people and me!

11649 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
11650 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
11651 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
11652 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
11653 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
11654 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11655 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11656 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11657 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11658 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11659 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11660 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11661 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11662 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11663 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11664 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11665 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11666 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11667 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11668 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11669 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11670 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11671 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11672 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11673 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11674 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11675 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11676 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11677 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11678 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11679 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11680 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11681 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11682 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11683 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11684 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11685 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11686 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11687 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11688 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11689 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11690 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11691 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11692 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11693 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11694 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11695 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
