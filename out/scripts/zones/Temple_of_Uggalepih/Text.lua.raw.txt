6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7386 : A workbook written by Iru-Kuiru.
7387 : That place was most definitely cursed. It was as if each of us were having our strings pulled by some unseen force...
7388 : The Goddess only knows what that power was. I knew fear like I had never known before, and was struck mindless with panic before the terror that lurked within those walls.
7389 : A diary written by Iru-Kuiru.
7390 : A letter has arrived from the homeland. The San d'Orian member of the Allied Expedition, Francmage M Mistalle, has lost his life to the curse...
7391 : And then yesterday, my friend and fellow Allied explorer, Yow Rabntah, was taken from this world...
7392 : I can feel the shadow closing in on me. I believe the darkness will claim me before I am able to finish this research. And I was so close to putting all the pieces of this legend together...
7393 : A tome written on the subject of Fei'Yin.
7394 : I would like to bring attention to the many small chambers that exist in the subterranean levels of the ruins of Fei'Yin.
7395 : In each of these chambers stands an automaton. A golem, or giant, if you will. Were these golems given the task of sentry, or simply employed as servants?
7396 : It is possible to conclude from the artifacts discovered in these ruins that it was once the abode of an ancient people. One can further deduce from the evidence that this civilization was wiped out by some sudden calamity.
7397 : Hmm? Aren't you zee adventurer zat helped with zat Fei'Yin talisman affair?
7398 : You were looking for moi? And why may zat be...?
7399 : ...I see. Leepe-Hoppe eez such a worry-wart. He fears zat I will share zee same fate as poor Iru-Kuiru.
7400 : Iru-Kuiru was chasing after zee truth behind zee legend of Windurst. He wanted to know how Windurst came to be, and who led our Tarutaru ancestors to our current home.
7401 : Zee members of zee Rhinosterie, however, were not happy with his research. Zey are happy believing zat our ancestors were guided by a wondrous star--zee same star zat watches over us.
7402 : But Iru-Kuiru must have discovered something on his sojourn to zee Northlands. It was enough to make him leave zee Rhinosterie and find his way here...
7403 : And zis eez where Iru-Kuiru met his demise.
7404 : Zee things zat Kerutoto saw in her meditations... It may have been Iru-Kuiru's way of calling me here to show me zee truth.
7405 : To let me know zat...
7406 : You feel the % move...
7407 : !!!
7408 : Children of Windurst, thou hath journeyed far. The very same children we led to the land of promise so many years ago...
7409 : Wh-who are you?
7410 : I am Grav'iton Berrisacci. I am what hath become of the Kuluu.
7411 : Zee Kuluu... One of zee two ancient races mentioned in Iru-Kuiru's works? The Kuluu and zee Zilart...
7412 : Zat one of zee ancients has survived here until present day... Tell me, are zee Kuluu a race of immortals?
7413 : No, we are not. I am no longer a part of this world. What lingers here are merely my thoughts and memories.
7414 : Star Sibyl, dost thou not remember? The long distant past when I still breathed. When we Kuluu led thy people to the land of the moon...
7415 : Is the truth not handed down through the generations? Surely thou hast not lost the power of Horutoto given to the first Star Sibyl?
7416 : What do you mean? Zee Kuluu built zee Horutoto...?
7417 : ...I can't even begin to understand it, but if it's zee towers of zee Horutoto Ruins you are referring to, they ceased to function twenty years ago...
7418 : This cannot be! If what thou sayest be truth, the great beast of the moon will be unleashed upon the land!
7419 : Those towers were built to convert the moonlight that bathes the land into energy. If the towers no longer function, the moonlight's power will take the shape of a great roaming fiend...
7420 : Is the Diza Star given to the first Star Sibyl yet within thy possession?
7421 : ...I'm afraid you are mistaken. I am not zee Star Sibyl. I am zee minister of zee Rhinostery, one of zee five ministries zat serve Her Holiness.
7422 : Thou art not the Star Sibyl? Then why dost thine attendant carry her tome? I can sense its aura surrounding [him/her]. That book was written by the first Star Sibyl using the power of the moon.
7423 : ...I see. The tome lost its power when the towers fell into ruin. Well, I should not be overly surprised, as it hath been several thousand years...
7424 : However, my little ones, I cannot bear to see thee so distressed. As we guided thine ancestors to the land of the moon many years ago, I will now guide thee in this matter.
7425 : I will use my power to return magic to the tome. My strength pales in comparison to that of the moon, however...
7426 : The contents of the book will soon fade, but I pray that this act may be of some small assistance.
7427 : %, you're awake...
7428 : ...Zee Kuluu elder vanished in zat burst of light.
7429 : If what she said is true, we have learned some amazing historical facts here today. It proves zee theory put forth by Iru-Kuiru...
7430 : Take zat tome directly to Windurst and show it to Minister Ajido-Marujido of zee Orastery. He would be zee only person capable of reading it.
7431 : Oh, and please tell Leepe-Hoppe zat I'm safe and sound. When I'm done reading Iru-Kuiru's research, I will return to Windurst.
7432 : ...I've started to get zee shakes after all zat. What a strange experience we've just been through!
7433 : ...People are untrustworthy... ...People break promise...
7434 : ...So if you want to be purged of rancor...
7435 : First, you pay me # gil!
7436 : Pay # gil? Yes. No.
7437 : The built-up hate has been cleansed...!
7438 : However, the flame of rancor still remains...
7439 : The door is firmly shut.
7440 : You have no built-up hate to cleanse.
7441 : Something lies under the rubble.
7442 : It is just a pile of rubble.
7443 : A haunting song suddenly echoes throughout the ruins...
7444 : Nothing... Nothing... Nothing I can't cut... Nothing...
7445 : Chop! Chop!! Chop!!! Chop!!!!
7446 : Chop... Chop...... Chop......... Can't cut!!!
7447 : Get out! Get out!! Get out!!! Get out!!!!
7448 : ...
7449 : ...
7450 : You cannot open this door.
7451 : This platform looks a place for an offering.
7452 : Something is written here, but you cannot make out the words.
7453 : The % slightly quivers, but there is no sign of Lightbringer here.
7454 : The % begins to quiver!
7455 : You could not find Lightbringer here. Your investigation is over.
7456 : Some sort of ceremony was performed here...
7457 : Your wyvern reacts violently to this spot!
7458 : Hm... It seems my trap was of little consequence after all. Not altogether unexpected.
7459 : However, I am skilled in more than just swordplay. I have also conquered the arts of necromancy. With the helm of the last dragoon I will resurrect the spirit of Erpalacion.
7460 : He was betrayed by his home of San d'Oria, as was I. He will understand my need for revenge...!
7461 : I never dreamed the day would come when your kind would once again fly free in Vana'diel...
7462 : %, I am most grateful to you.
7463 : What are you waiting for, dragoon? As I was dismissed from my position of command, you were exiled from San d'Oria by King Ranperre.
7464 : Now is our chance to exact our vengeance upon the kingdom that betrayed us. Let this adventurer be the first to be sentenced in our trial of blood!
7465 : I have nothing but gratitude towards San d'Oria. Why would I sympathize with the plight of a spiteful child...?
7466 : This is not the way it's supposed to be...!
7467 : Ancolain B Feulart, I hereby arrest you on charges of theft and violence against the Court of San d'Oria.
7468 : I waited for you, Ancolain, believing that you would come to your senses and recognize your mistakes. Your position as second in command had been held vacant for your return.  It's a shame things had to turn out like this, but you'll have time to reflect upon your sins in jail.
7469 : No...!
7470 : ...!?
7471 : That armor! It can't be. The last dragoon...!
7472 : I am Erpalacion. And you must be the dragonslayer.
7473 : I am Erpalacion. I have met you before at the Tomb of King Ranperre. You were the dragonslayer.
7474 : Then, that time...! I never thought it was real...
7475 : If you are truly the last dragoon, then there is something that I must ask you. Why did the wise King Ranperre give you such an unreasonable order?
7476 : There is an explanation for that... It was the night of our triumphant homecoming...
7477 : Erpalacion, it is all finally over...
7478 : I'm afraid not, Your Majesty. This is only the beginning. You must turn your efforts towards rebuilding this war-ravaged country.
7479 : Yes...you are right. And you will be here to help us, I trust? Without your strength, the insurrection would have been a difficult thing to put down...
7480 : About that, Your Majesty...
7481 : What is it, Erpalacion? Surely you're not considering retirement at your tender years! There are still many endeavors that will require your abilities.
7482 : ...I must apologize, but I can no longer remain here in San d'Oria. Forgive me, Your Majesty.
7483 : What is this you speak of? Tell me why this must be.
7484 : I...  During the course of this insurgence, an unholy sign has appeared upon my wyvern. In the heat of battle we slew those that have no sins to answer for. This is our punishment.
7485 : Great Goddess...! Even as a dragonslayer, I failed to notice the sign. Forgive me, Erpalacion...
7486 : I believe that dragons teach us the folly of our ways. To restore the holy sign, I must go where no people dwell and spend the rest of my life in quiet solitude.
7487 : I see... Well, I have no right to prevent you from leaving. If there is anything I can do, you must let me know.
7488 : Your Majesty, I must ask you to assist me in convincing others that I had perished in battle.
7489 : What are you saying, Erpalacion?
7490 : If it is known that I still live, I will be hounded incessantly by foreign assassins, or those who hunger for a return to the days of war. The only way I can cast aside my bloodstained lance is to be dead in the eyes of the world.
7491 : That being said, you must know that I can never meet with Your Majesty again.
7492 : !!! To go to such extremes... That I must lose the one person who understands me so well...
7493 : However, I must not keep you here for my sake; you have your own road to travel. ...I will send you on an expedition. Use the opportunity to disappear from this land.
7494 : I have no doubt that every citizen in this kingdom will be present for your state funeral.
7495 : My liege, you have my deepest gratitude...
7496 : Tonight marks our final farewell. At the very least, we should empty a few glasses and talk until the dawn. What say you?
7497 : ...As you wish, Your Majesty.
7498 : And so, following the king's plan, I retired with my wyvern to the mountains.
7499 : Thankfully, the unholy mark that blighted my wyvern faded, but by that time, I was too old to leave those snow-capped peaks.  So, I decided to spend my remaining days raising a new wyvern.
7500 : I left this life with my dream still unrealized... But now I see that there were others who carried out my final wish. You have given new life to the race of dragons.
7501 : Now is the time for me to return to my eternal slumber. Allow me a moment with this wyvern child.
7502 : Grow strong, little one... The life that pulses within you is not yours alone. You hold the spark of all the wyverns that were denied life in this world...
7503 : The last dragoon... He was a man worthy of the title.
7504 : You have performed your duty well. We will escort Ancolain back to San d'Oria and quash these rumors that dishonor the last dragoon. You have the gratitude of the Royal Knights.
7505 : As Erpalacion stated, you and your wyvern have an important destiny to fulfill. Keep that in mind, and take good care of your winged companion. ...Until we meet again.
7506 : It looks like some sort of device. A thin thread leads down to the floor...
7507 : A pungent odor rises up from this area of the floor...
7508 : A high pitched sound would echo very well in this place...
7509 : You blow into the %.
7510 : It is a beehive...
7511 : Bits of vegetable matter are strewn around. They appear to have been gnawed on by insects...
7512 : Nothing happens...
7513 : You sense an ominous presence...
7514 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7515 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7516 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7517 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7518 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7519 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7520 : Now, listen close...
7521 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7522 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7523 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7524 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7525 : .........listen......
7526 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7527 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7528 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. Lightbringer. Awakening of the Gods. Moon Reading. Knight Stalker. The Cursed Temple. Where Divinities Collide(pt.1). Where Divinities Collide(pt.2). Where Divinities Collide(pt.3). Where Divinities Collide(pt.4).
7532 : Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
7533 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
7534 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
7535 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
7536 : You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
7537 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
7538 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
7539 : Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
7540 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
7541 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
7542 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
7543 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
7544 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
7545 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
7546 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
7547 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
7548 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
7549 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
7550 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
7551 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
7552 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
7553 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
7554 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
7555 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
7556 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
7557 : You can only carry one %.
7558 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
7559 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
7560 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
7561 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
7562 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
7563 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
7564 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
7565 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
7566 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
7567 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
7568 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
7569 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
7570 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
7571 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...

7627 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
7628 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
7629 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
7630 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
7631 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
7632 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
7633 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
7634 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
7635 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
7636 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
7637 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
7638 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
7639 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
7640 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
7641 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
7642 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
7643 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
7644 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
7645 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
7646 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
7647 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
7648 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
7649 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
7650 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
7651 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
7652 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
7653 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
7654 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
7655 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
7656 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
7657 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
7658 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
7659 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
7660 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
7661 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
7662 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
7663 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
7664 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
7665 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
7666 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.

11707 : But is he not the Keeper of the Apocalypse? How are we to parley with one such as he?
11708 : Perhaps I can avoid the long-winded explanation. Selh'teus is able to cross the boundaries between this world and the next.
11709 : Yet one question remains--how canst thou meet him?
11710 : I must reiterate that thou must first cross over via the crystal, and to do that requires one to guide thee.
11711 : I am at a loss...
11712 : The three of ye have faith in Altana, do ye not?
11713 : Do you have faith in Altana? I do. I do not.
11714 : Master, I know you have always had a penchant for jokes, but...
11715 : Of course Master and I both believe in Altana.
11716 : Of course Master and I both believe in Altana.
11717 : As do I. Phoenix has shown me the light[/, and continues to do so].
11718 : Then it shall be but a small task for thee to visit the crystal.
11719 : Deep beneath the earth slumber five stones, each of which containeth an inordinate amount of power.
11720 : Three are located beneath the spires of Holla, Dem, and Mea.
11721 : I have laid my own eyes upon the objects of which you speak!
11722 : I alighted upon one when I first descended from the future.
11723 : Then that only serveth to prove that thy bonds with the Goddess are taut and firm.
11724 : Perhaps they shall resonate with the crystals and provide the answers thou seekest.
11725 : Lady Grav'iton, your guidance is greatly appreciated.
11726 : I have shared with thee all I am privy to. The rest is for thee and thy companions to decide.
11727 : Yet I cannot say what to expect even shouldst thou succeed. Ensure that thou remainest prepared for any eventuality.
