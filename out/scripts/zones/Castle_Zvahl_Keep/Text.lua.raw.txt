6984 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
6985 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
6986 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
6987 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6988 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6989 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6990 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6991 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6992 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6993 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6994 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6995 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6996 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6997 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6998 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6999 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7000 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7001 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7002 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7003 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7004 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7005 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7006 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7007 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7008 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7009 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7010 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7011 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7012 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7013 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7014 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7015 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7016 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7017 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7018 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7019 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7020 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7021 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7022 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7023 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7024 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7025 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7026 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7027 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7028 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7029 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7030 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7031 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7032 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7033 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7034 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7035 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7036 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7037 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7038 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7039 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7040 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]
7041 : Ready? I'm taking my shot!
7042 : Keep your eyes open! You don't wanna miss this!
7043 : I see an opening. Get ready to follow up.
7044 : Are you ready? I'm beginning my attack!
7045 : I'm going to attack! Are you ready?
7046 : Keep your eyes peeled! I'm going in for the big one!
7047 : Are preparations in order, [sir/milady]? Then, I shall proceed with my offensive.
7048 : I'm warmed up now. Time for a real attack!
7049 : Don't blink now! Follow my lead!
7050 : Are you ready? I'm taking my shot!
7051 : Alrighty! Here goes nothing!
7052 : Are you ready? I'm beginning my attack!
7053 : I'm going in, so get ready! No slipping up!
7054 : It's my turrrn! Get ready to pounce after me!

7069 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
7070 : So far, we've only taken down # [enemy/enemies] today!
7071 : How many enemies have we defeated? Only #. You can count that high, right...?
7072 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
7073 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
7074 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
7075 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7076 : We've only beaten # [enemy/enemies] so far. Don't tell me you're tired already!?
7077 : Only # [enemy has/enemies have] fallen to us today! We're just getting started!
7078 : The last enemy we defeated was number #.
7079 : The last enemy we took down was number #.
7080 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
7081 : Only # [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
7082 : We've beaten at least two...right?
7083 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
7084 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
7085 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...
7086 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7087 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7088 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7089 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7090 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7091 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7092 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7093 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7094 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7095 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7096 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7097 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7098 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7099 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7100 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7101 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7102 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7103 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7104 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7105 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7106 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7107 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7108 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7109 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7110 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7256 : Greetings, friend, and welcome to the Mog Merchants Extraordinaire! Here, you can exchange your hard-earned kupons for all sorts of stupendous souvenirs!
7257 : ...Or so we thought, kupo. Sadly, it seems that my cohorts are slacking off on the job. They're nowhere to be found!
7258 : Unless they come back, I fear that your % is nothing but a worthless scrap of parchment. I know! Perhaps you could help me track them down, kupo?
7259 : How about it? Let's do it. Do your own job.
7260 : Hmph. Fine, be that way! No fur off my nose, kupo. That's one less prize wasted on an ungrateful adventurer.
7261 : Oh, a thousand thank-yous, kind adventurer! Without my accomplices--er, associates--the boss's plans will all be for naught! I mean, our customers will be distraught, kupo!
7262 : <Ahem>! As I was saying... I'd be ever so grateful if you could find our [horticulturist/ironmonger/pyrotechnician/pawnbroker], [Kupatete/Kupignol/Kupuckl/Kupert], and escort [her/his/his/his] procrastinating moogle posterior back to work.
7263 : They're far too lazy to have ventured outside this keep, so you should be able to find them loafing around here somewhere, kupo.
7264 : [Kupatete/Kupignol/Kupuckl/Kupert], you say? Sorry, you've got the wrong moogle. I think I saw [her/him/him/him] [enjoying a snack to the east/wandering out west/slacking off down south/napping up to the north] not too long ago...
7265 : Slacking on the job!? Me, kupo!? Why, I never--! No, I was just...ah...patrolling this area for stray beastmen! Yeah, that's the ticket!
7266 : Can't have those fiends assaulting our honored festival-goers, now, can we? Well, <ahem>...everything seems to be in order here, so let's return! And for your troubles, why don't I exchange that % you've got there for this shiny new %?
7267 : Just don't tell the boss I was sleeping on the job. Deal, kupo? In return, that % will allow you to take part in this festival's grand finale...
7268 : The Mega Mog Bonanza-Rama-Palooza! Doesn't that name positively scream excitement!?
7269 : What's even more exciting are the exclusive prizes you could win, kupo. If I were you, why, I'd flap my little wings as furiously as I could and make for the main event without delay!
7270 : Welcome to the Mog Merchants Extraordinaire souvenir shop, where you can exchange that hard-earned % of yours for scores of spectacular prizes!
7271 : What's that? You don't have a %!? Er...then just forget I said anything, kupo!
7272 : Or, if you fancy yourself to have nerves of darksteel...! The courage to look fear in the eye and make it your master...! You could go win yourself one at our event in the castle baileys! Do you have it in you, kupo!?
