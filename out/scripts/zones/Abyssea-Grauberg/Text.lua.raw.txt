6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7352 : What would you like to do? Nothing. Learn about visitant status. Request visitant status. Extend visitant status.
7353 : All inter-dimensional travelers such as yourself must acquire visitant status in order to journey within Abyssea. To be granted this status, you must provide me with %.
7354 : Having come from a different plane of existence, your existential phase is unaligned to that of Abyssea. To overcome this problem, % is required. It acts as a stabilizing agent that aligns and anchors your essence to Abyssea for prolonged periods of time.
7355 : Bereft of its effect, your essence will become unraveled within a matter of minutes, after which you will be expelled to your own reality. Do make a habit of first coming to me upon arrival in Abyssea.
7356 : A word of warning. As the presence of unaligned entities may have adverse effects on this dimension, only those with visitant status are permitted to venture beyond the searing ward.
7357 : Those without visitant status will be forcibly returned to the searing ward's vicinity. This is a preventative measure against the detrimental effects of inter-dimensional noise.

7362 : Many are the reports of positive things occurring while under its auspices, from a general upturn in fortunes to more specific benefits such as accelerated growth and greater ease of cruor harvesting.
7363 : Naturally, these benefits will not come to the idle. The gains have been observed to grow proportionately to one's exploits in Abyssea.
7364 : All good things come to an end, however, and this is no exception. The effects endure as long as you remain in Abyssea, but will wear off at the instant of your departure.
7365 : That concludes my explanation of the visitant status. Remember always to obtain the status upon arrival in Abyssea.

7376 : Greetings, traveler. I am a resistance officer whose charge is the procurement of cruor. If you would be willing to part with any cruor you possess, I will issue you with helpful items in return.
7377 : What will you do? (Cruor balance: #) Nothing. Learn about cruor. Exchange for items. Exchange for temporary items. Exchange for key items. Exchange for enhancement effects. Dispose of abyssite.
7378 : Cruor is a naturally occurring mineral found as deposits on creatures native to Abyssea.
7379 : Known by some as blood gold, these red granules are highly prized and see use as both energy source and construction material.
7380 : It would be no exaggeration to say that cruor is the lifeblood of the resistance effort. As a matter of fact, the bulk of items I have in stock are cruor-based.
7381 : Chief among them being ancient abyssite, a highly concentrated, doubly valuable form of the stone boasting diverse benefits.
7382 : Ancient abyssite has been observed to improve the fortunes and vitality of their possessors, not unlike a good luck talisman.
7383 : The most popular varieties offer extended visitant status time, accelerated growth, and myriad enhancement effects. Some are even said to improve luck, but such benefits can be troublesome to measure.
7384 : I am limited in the types of ancient abyssite I can issue. The opportunity to acquire rarer varieties, however, will surely visit you during your time in Abyssea.
7385 : Besides the issuance of items, I am also authorized to imbue you with enhancement effects.

7424 : Trade for # of the item? Yes. No.
7425 : You receive # ) in exchange for # cruor.
7426 : Well met, wayfarer. I am an Atma Infusionist, and from my title I trust you can glean my field of expertise. Those who possess % may come to me to have atma infused.
7427 : How might I serve you? You may not. Tell me about atma. Infuse me with atma. Examine infused atma. Purge atma. Reinfuse previous atma set. Select from recent history.
7428 : Atma is most accurately described as the crystalline agglomeration of an Abyssean creature's soul. Through painstaking research, we infusionists have discovered a way to imbue ordinary people such as yourself with its power.
7429 : Infusion makes possible the augmentation of individuals, granting them powers particular to the creature from which the atma is sourced.
7430 : The infusion process requires three objects: an atma, %, and cruor.
7431 : % is a rare variety of ancient abyssite that can only be procured with great difficulty. And it won't please you to know that atma is rarer still.
7432 : For only the most savage creatures, you see, are known to yield atma. And if you thought that weren't trial enough, only by employing special combat strategies will atma be yours to own.
7433 : Atma-yielding monsters are known to have vulnerabilities that, if exploited, may result in a swift end to the confrontation.
7434 : Strike at a foe's weakness, and it will drop different spoils, often more valuable than usual. Among them you may find atma.
7435 : The vulnerabilities can broadly be divided into three categories: magic attacks, physical-based weapon skills, and magic-based weapon skills.
7436 : For instance, there are monsters known to be weak against magic-based weapon skills. Inflicting such damage upon them will impair their movement, and you may consequently be rewarded with atma.
7437 : All living creatures, however, possess the capacity to adapt, and vulnerabilities have been observed to change. Be wary if you wish not to discover to your sorrow that a once-foolproof strategy no longer applies.
7438 : Besting such fell creatures is in itself a harrowing task, and becomes even more so if procuring atma is your objective.
7439 : But should fortune smile upon you and you find yourself in possession of atma, bring it here. I will see that it serves you well.
7440 : Which atma will you have infused? None for now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Previous page. Next page.

7462 : Replace currently infused atma? Yes, replace. No, cancel.

7464 : Have the selected atma infused? Confirm. Cancel.
7465 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with [his/her] chosen atma set!
7466 : Greetings. I am an atma fabricant--or, to the layman, one who fabricates atma. I can synthesize atma from the memories of adventure stored deep within your body and soul. If you have need of my services, you need only speak the word.
7467 : Ask for something? No thanks. Synthetic atma? My memories? Show me the atma.
7468 : As you are no doubt aware, the substance we call atma is a crystalline agglomeration of soul energy that can be harvested from the bodies of fallen Abyssean fiends.
7469 : The abundant power that it imbues when infused into our bodies is not in question. The perilous means by which it must be acquired, however, leaves something to be desired.
7470 : After all, bolstering the strength of one man means little if ten others must lose their lives in the process. Thus was the impetus behind our research: to discover a means for extracting atma from resources at our immediate disposal.
7471 : We experimented with nearly every substance in sight--be it animal, vegetable, or mineral. Yet each time, the atma produced was small, fragile, and entirely absent of the power we sought.
7472 : Then, one day, we hit upon the obvious answer that we had so long overlooked...ourselves. Yes, the atma extracted from our own bodies--particularly those richly possessed of experiences and memories--these housed a power rivalling that harvested from the most vicious of fiends.
7473 : If you possess such memories, then I can bring forth the latent power that resides within you as well.
7474 : Fear not, for there is everything to gain and nothing to lose. Save for some cruor, that is...
7475 : Curious, is it not? That potent physical energy can be extracted from such a tenuous, intangible thing...
7476 : But the strength our memories and experiences give us is real, if all too easily overlooked. Once isolated, it is simply a matter of recalling it, solidifying it, and bringing it to the fore.
7477 : Surely you understand of what it is I speak, yes? Your greatest accomplishments--those that make others stand in wonderment and admiration when you they hear your name.
7478 : We summon forth the energies from the deepest recesses of your psyche, and infuse it into the cruor you carry. The resultant agglomeration of organic mineral and soul energy is synthetic atma.
7479 : Mind you, the deeper and more puissant your energies, the more cruor will be necessary to contain it all. If you wish to have me assay the powers that lie dormant within you, simply speak the word.
7480 : Very well. We shall see what latent powers you possess. Stand still and clear your mind...
7481 : Yes...it is as I thought... Long and far have you traveled...many a battle have you fought...
7482 : Yes, I see within you # [memory/memories] that I could process into atma. Which shall I extract?
7483 : ...And yet, I see nothing tangible enough for me to process. I am sorry.
7484 : Synthesize atma? (Cruor balance: #) None for now. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. Previous page. Next page.

7778 : I'm a Resistance officer charged with overseeing the Dominion effort, and we're looking for a few good [men/women]. Since I don't see any around, it looks like you'll have to do.
7779 : Ask about something? Not now. General information. State of the Resistance. State of the enemy. Exchange Dominion Notes. Exchange battle trophies.
7780 : Ask about something? Not now. The Dominion effort...? How do I do my part? What's in it for me?
7781 : Wake up, soldier! I don't know if you're blind or stupid, but if you haven't noticed, there's a war going on around you.
7782 : The Resistance is locked in a bitter struggle to take back our rightful land from the hordes, and secure a future for our kind. We call this the Dominion effort. Has an inspiring ring to it, doesn't it, soldier?
7783 : And if you haven't noticed, we don't exactly have a surplus of personnel. Hell, I just got a field promotion from sergeant to tactician when my predecessor got his head lopped clean off by a fiend. Now they've got some sissy boy doing my old job, but do you hear me complainin'?
7784 : Anyhow, if you've got half a bloody stump of a leg to stand on and an arm to carry a blade, consider yourself recruited. Now listen up, soldier, because I'm only going to say this once.
7785 : I'll put this in terms even a dullard like you can understand. The enemy we face consists of two types of fiends: nasty ones, and even nastier ones.
7786 : We've got legions of ugly monsters prowling the land in throngs. We cut them down, and lure their even nastier buddies out of hiding.
7787 : These fiends are the beating heart of our enemy. Bring them down, and our battle is as good as won. Get it? Good. Now hop to it, soldier!
7788 : Hah! Ya may be short on wits, but you've got pluck. There may be hope for you yet, soldier.
7789 : If you're ready to make yourself useful, then you'll want to seek out one of our outposts. There's three in the area, so even a rookie like yourself should be able to stumble upon one of 'em by dumb luck.
7790 : Talk with a sergeant there, and sign up for one of our operations--Dominion Ops, we call 'em for short. Each op will involve exterminating a prescribed quota of a particular variety of fiend.
7791 : If you're halfway competent at your job, the Resistance will gradually expand its sphere of influence over the hordes. Our ultimate goal is complete domination against all manner of fiends. That's one hundred percent, soldier!
7792 : What if I just kill fiends without signing up for ops, you say? Don't give me any of that lip, soldier!
7793 : Listen. Every fiend you bring down will aid the cause. But we can't be certain that we've achieved complete domination unless you sign up for ops, and report your success to the sergeant. You'll also be rewarded for your efforts. Bet that got your interest quick, didn't it?
7794 : There's more, soldier. This may sound bloody obvious--well, maybe not to a lackwit like you--but success in your efforts will raise the spirits of our entire company.
7795 : With the resulting boost in morale, our troops will fight with even greater fervor, affording us all manner of advantages in battle. What kind of advantages? Hah! That's for us to know and you to find out, soldier!
7796 : Expand our sphere of influence over the peons, and we'll start to lure the big boys out of the woodwork.
7797 : Take them out, and the biggest, baddest foes will start to show up. Where does it all end, you say? It doesn't! This is war, soldier, not a Lightsday afternoon walk in the park!
7798 : Now, where was I? The enemy leaders pack a punch, but they rely on their flunkies as the foundation for their strength.
7799 : Cut their subordinates out from underneath them, and they won't have a leg--or gnarled, twisted appendage--to stand upon. That's smart fighting. And in war, you fight smart or you die, soldier!
7800 : I couldn't tell you how many of these buggers we're up against, but I do know this. Each one we kill brings us closer to our goal of utter domination.
7801 : To keep morale high, we can't let up the attack on the enemy leaders. You got all that, soldier?
7802 : What's in it for you? You've got some nerve, soldier!
7803 : You're here to follow orders, not question them! When I say jump, you say how many malms high, sir!? Are we understood, soldier!?
7804 : But yeah, there's somethin' in it for you, if that's the only thing that's going to get you fighting for our cause instead of sitting around on your lazy backside.
7805 : When you report back after completing an operation or successfully bring down a notorious foe, you'll be awarded remuneration in the form of something we call Dominion Notes.
7806 : These notes can be exchanged for supplies to serve you on the field of battle: equipment, medicine, and more. And we're not talking your run-of-the-mill items here. This is some impressive stuff. I daresay it's worth more than your life, soldier.
7807 : Bet that put a spark in your eyes, didn't it? What's more, bring back battle trophies--the severed heads and gore-stained limbs of the fiends you slay--and we will reward your accomplishments with guerdon.
7808 : There are five echelons of trophies in total. Slaying more powerful fiends will yield more prestigious trophies, which in turn will earn you more valuable guerdon.
7809 : Battle trophies can even be exchanged for each other. Multiple lower-echelon trophies can be upgraded to a single trophy of a higher echelon, or vice versa. If you've got half a brain inside that skull of yours, you'll take advantage of this to obtain the guerdon you desire.
7810 : The guerdon we offer consists of some of the richest spoils we've acquired in the course of the war--equipment augmented by powerful sorcery. What manner of sorcery, you ask? That's classified information, soldier!
7811 : And mind you, since they were magicked long before we got our hands on them, we have no way of altering the enchantment. In other words, you'll take what we give you, and you'll thank us for it, soldier!
7812 : Intelligence reports assess the Resistance's sphere of influence in this area at # percent.
7813 : We've received reports that Captain [Excenmille/Nanaa Mihgo/Volker]'s region is overrun with fiends. What are you waiting for? Get out there, soldier!
7814 : We've received reports that Captain [Maat/Romaa Mihgo/Zazarg]'s region is overrun with fiends. What are you waiting for? Get out there, soldier!
7815 : We've received reports that Captain [Wolfgang/Cornelia/Tosuka-Porika]'s region is overrun with fiends. What are you waiting for? Get out there, soldier!
7816 : Our most recent intel has it that we've felled # percent of the horde's most notorious fiends.
7817 : Our troops are currently reaping these morale benefits...
7818 : HP/MP bonus: Level #.

7825 : ...None at all. Morale sucks, and you sure aren't helping by standing around here. Get out on the battlefield, soldier!
7826 : Morale's not bad, but it can always be better. Get out on the battlefield, soldier!

8017 : <Sigh>... That's why I told you to mind your own businessy. Now Eight of Clubs has to live with this painful knowledge.
8018 : Chancing upony the two Cardians that fateful day and seeing their suffering, I did what I thought was besty to free them from grief.
8019 : But it looks to have been to little avail--the memory was lying latent just beneathy the surface this whole time.

8044 : But I think the truth can wait for a while longery before being let out of the bag.
8045 : Perhaps a time will come when Eight of Hearts will be ready to learny all.

8048 : I'm going to stay by Eight of Hearts' side and ensure that he never wants for peace of mindy.
8049 : Well, howdy there, pardnerrr. Pardon mah askin', but did you mosey on over here at Tosuka-Porika's request, by any chance?
8050 : Did Tosuka-Porika send you? He sure did! Tosu...who?
8051 : Oh, dang! I'm sorry fer bein' late on the delivery!
8052 : I've been experrriencin'...uh, a pebble in mah boots--technical difficulties that've prevented business from runnin' as usual.
8053 : Not in Tosuka-Porika's employ? Well, that's a relief. I'm supposed to be makin' a delivery fer him, you see, but've been experrriencin'...uh, a pebble in mah boots--technical difficulties that've prevented business from rrrunnin' as usual.
8054 : Mah pack chocobo's been under the weather o' late, refusin' to eat anythin' I put in frrront o' it.
8055 : It's all this lone wrrrangler can do to get it to sip water. Needless to say, the creature ain't in no shape to be transporrrtin' freight fer lack o' nourishment.
8056 : This dang cataclysm's affected us all, but it mus' be especially harrrd fer the poor feller. I reckon it's got more'n its fair share o' strrress pent up beneath that fluffy plumage.
8057 : I've tried givin' it half-a-hunnerd diff'rent types o' feed, but it won't so much as sniff any o' 'em. I'm at mah wit's end, pardnerrr. If I can't find somethin' to its taste, and soon, there'll be nothin' left o' the crrreature but feathers and bones!
8058 : [Kweh.../Kweh!/Kweh./Kwehhh!/Kweh.]
8059 : The chocobo refuses to eat.
8060 : The chocobo hungrily scoffs down the %!
8061 : Well, I'll be darrrned! What in the post-apocalyptic world did you feed it?
8062 : %? That ain't nothin' I've ever heard of beforrre.
8063 : Somethin' found only in these parts, you say? Hmmm... I reckon the creaturrre must've somehow managed to adapt to the new environment, clever lil' beastie.
8064 : At any rate, it's a right relief to know that there's still food it's willin' to eat. You're a real lifesaver, pardnerrr. By way o' thanks, here's a lil' somethin' fer you.
8065 : Now mah feathered friend and I can get back to the jolly ol' business o' transporrrtin' goods!
8066 : You gave it what!? Are you plumb outta yer noggin!? You mus' never--everrr--feed % to chocobos!
8067 : Once you give 'em a taste of it, they'll refuse to eat anythin' else! Even a halfwit dunderhead knows that!
8068 : [Too late, dang it.../<Sigh>...] Well, there ain't no helpin' it now. We'll jus' have to keep feedin' it % till it starrrts gaggin' and squawkin' fer somethin' else.
8069 : The chocobo appears to be in good cheer.
8070 : % do not seem to satisfy the chocobo.
8071 : Looks like it's finally eaten its fill! Yeeeeee-haw!
8072 : But it ain't good fer the creature to chow down only on % day in, day out. We gotta find somethin' wholesome and properrr to feed it with.
8073 : The chocobo digs up something from the ground!
8074 : The chocobo proffers the object to %.
8075 : Well, howdy there, pardnerrr! How's about assistin' in feedin' this here feathered frrriend o' mine?
8076 : Help feed the chocobo? Certainly! Not right now.
8077 : Thanks a bundle o' top-quality hay, pardnerrr! I'm countin' on you!

8112 : In zee past, Witchfire Glen was 'ome to a large population of benevolent pixies. Ever since zee cataclysm, 'owever, zee creatures 'ave grown 'ostile et aggressive.
8113 : Zrough scrupulous investigation, I 'ave determined zat water contamination eez zee culprit behind zis change.
8114 : While eet eez impracticable to restore zee springs to zeir former pristine state, zee problem of malicious pixies can be solved by increasing zee concentration of certain components essentielles een zee water.
8115 : %... Adding zis to zee water will proliferate zee growth of said components.
8116 : Eet may take some time before zee effects become perceptible. As such, eet eez impratif zat we are persistent in our efforts. Merci d'advance!
8117 : The spring appears murky from contamination.
8118 : % administers the % to the water.
8119 : Nothing happens...
8120 : The water seems to be a tint more transparent than a moment ago.
8121 : The pixie flashes a genial smile at %.
8122 : Hm? Could zat be...%?
8123 : Why, zis could only mean a pixie 'as regained 'er former benevolence! Vous 'ave done well!
8124 : Without ado, I shall take zee % off your 'ands.
8125 : Rukususu snatches the % from %!
8126 : And now, zee moment I 'ave awaited pour so long. Wiz just a sprinkling of zee %...
8127 : Voila! Mon talisman du warding d'evil...eet eez finally complete! Hee-hee-hee!
8128 : Wiz zis on mon person, I need no longer fear creatures of darkness!
8129 : ...Ah.
8130 : Do not worry, mon ami. I 'ave not forgotten about vous. Pour your services rendered, I offre vous zis by way of merci.
8131 : What's zat? Vous are curious about mon talisman du warding d'evil?
8132 : I-I am certain I do not know what vous are talking about! Now, I am a busy woman, so leave me be, s'il vous plait!
8133 : Many pixies still demonstrate 'ostile et aggressive behavior. Might I rely on your assistance once more to restore zee water composition?
8134 : Agree to help Rukususu? Avec pleasure! Perhaps un autre day.
8135 : I am sorry to 'ear zat vous will not aid une personne in need...
8136 : Ah, I knew I could prevail upon vous!
8137 : Hee-hee-hee! Yet anozer talisman du warding d'evil eez complete! Zis should serve to protect moi from otherworldly beings pour a time!
8138 : Ah, you there! Yes, you with the glimmer of determination in [his/her] eyes! I have a grave and urgent request, if you would listen to my tale.
8139 : Are you perchance familiar with the Teekesselchen, a dreadful fiend that terrorizes these parts? Resistance soldiers have tried to hunt it down, but thus far all attempts to slay the detestable beast have ended in miserable failure.
8140 : Yet not all hope is lost. I very recently procured an especially formulated draught through one of my contacts, you see.
8141 : The draught is claimed to have a weakening effect when used against the Teekesselchen. That's the theory, at least.
8142 : I have been meaning to have the draught tested in combat, but the Teekesselchen's notoriety is such that no volunteers have stepped forward. As it stands, we have what is believed to be a mighty weapon, but want for a wielder. Will you be that wielder?
8143 : Be the wielder? You can count on me! Sorry, not interested.
8144 : Hmph. A fool I was to think that perhaps you had a spine. I will simply have to find someone else who does.
8145 : I knew your answer from the very first moment I laid eyes on you! My thanks, friend. I keenly await the valiant details of your success.
8146 : The Teekesselchen is often seen prowling the area northwest of here.
8147 : Your task is straightforward: defeat the beast with the aid of %.
8148 : Misplaced the %, you say?
8149 : I will give you this replacement, but know that the draught can only be procured at great personal cost to myself. I must ask you to practice more caution in the future.
8150 : Welcome back, friend! Your epochal victory over the Teekesselchen--in no small part due to the %--has already reached my ears!
8151 : Now that the draught's effect has been proven beyond doubt, I will place a bulk order to sell to Wolfgang at a premium.
8152 : Your cooperation in this undertaking is highly appreciated. Take this as your deserved share for the role you played.
8153 : The % I sell to Wolfgang will no doubt earn me a tidy profit. The world as we knew it may have ended, but as the saying goes: the show must go on!
8154 : Well met, friend. Here for another %, mayhap?
8155 : Do you require %? Yes, please! No, thanks.
8156 : No? Let me know should you change your mind. It's the least I can do for someone to whom I owe my good fortune.
8157 : You wish to go another round with the Teekesselchen? Hahaha! A more bloodthirsty warrior I have never known!
8158 : I shall gladly furnish you with %. All I ask in return is that you report your success to me.
8159 : Good luck, friend. I keenly await the inspiring details of your victory.
8160 : The more times you put that foul beast in its place, the happier Wolfgang becomes. And a happy customer is a paying customer. This, my friend, is the golden rule of business.
8161 : Take this as a token of my gratitude. I look forward to your continued assistance in the future.
8162 : Greetings! You stand before Kurou-Morou the Magnificentaru, from whose astrologically enlightened eyes naught can be concealed!
8163 : That doubt-laden gaze you bear... It is all too plainy-wain that you hold my talents and purpose in skepticism.
8164 : Many are the unbelievers who feel the revered art of fortune-telling is no longer relevantaru in our bedraggled world.
8165 : To them I say a big phooey-wooey, for it is precisely in this age of death and destruction that folk depend on the solace offered by clairvoyance!
8166 : Now, since I have taken a liking to you, I will divine for you your lucky item and lucky spot--absolutely-wutely free of charge!
8167 : Hrmmm! Your lucky item is... %!
8168 : And your lucky spot is... [A place abundant in water/Someplace dark and cramped/A narrow pathway]!
8169 : With the specified lucky item in hand, seek out your designated lucky spot. In so doing, good fortune will surely visitaru you!
8170 : Your lucky item is %!
8171 : And your lucky spot is [a place abundant in water/someplace dark and cramped/a narrow pathway]!
8172 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. Why, I hear stories about monsters so nasty, they'd make a grown man wet his breeches! The wyverns hereabouts are worth mentionin'--real pieces of work that've been wreakin' serious havoc in the area.
8173 : Word on the highroad is, the creatures've been [waaay agitated lately, so approach at your own peril!/a tad alarmed lately./in good humor lately, if that can be believed.]
8174 : Hehehe, no need to say a word, friend. The cosmos has already revealed to me that good fortune has indeed visited you, in accordance-wordance with my divination. I trust you've learned not to doubtaru the significance of my talents.
8175 : Well met, wayfarer. I am in the midst of investigating the behavioral patterns of wyverns.
8176 : Should you learn something of these diabolical creatures in your journeys--anything at all--I would be glad for that information.
8177 : What's that? You've obtained intelligence regarding wyverns via a Goblin, you say? Please, you must share this knowledge with me!
8178 : Your source tells you the fiends have been [waaay agitated/a tad alarmed/in good humor] lately?
8179 : This information should prove useful in my endeavors. Please accept this with my thanks.
8180 : Should you learn anything new regarding wyverns, I ask that you relay the intelligence to me with the utmost haste. Lives are depending on it.
8181 : Ah, so once again you come to Kurou-Morou the Magnificentaru, seeking a window into your future.
8182 : Request a fortune reading? You read my mind! Sorry, not interested.
8183 : Tsk-tsk! Why do you insistaru on being untrue to yourself? Your insatiable hunger for the power of knowledge is plain to these eyes.
8184 : Very well, let the divination begin. As before, no paymentaru is required--serving the besty-west interests of the people is reward enough.
8185 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I recall havin' told you about particularilarily nasty wyverns. Well, here's an update on the beasties!
8186 : Ah, I had been wondering when next you would come this way. First of all, allow me to thank you for the day past.
8187 : Now, it shames me to have to request your aid again so soon, but I beg you to listen to our plight. Limited in resources and options as we are, my people and I need all the help we can get.
8188 : My quest for intelligence on wyverns--it was for no other purpose than to defeat an even fouler fiend, a fearsome hydra called Alfard.
8189 : This is the very creature that, in one fell swoop, laid waste to the Republican Army...and forever changed my father.
8190 : Alfard is invariably seen in the company of wyverns, which appear to act as bodyguards of sorts.
8191 : To attempt battling the creatures simultaneously would be tantamount to suicide. But if we could somehow remove the wyverns from the picture, we just might stand a chance of victory--of survival.
8192 : And so I beseech your aid. For the sake of the survivors, will you assist us by defeating the wyverns?
8193 : Defeat the wyverns? Consider it done! Sounds awfully dangerous...
8194 : Now that we're armed with vital knowledge of the wyverns' habits, the remaining task is straightforward.
8195 : I believe you have what it takes to strike down the savage creatures and restore hope to the downtrodden folk who now call this wilderness home.
8196 : With Zeid's inspiring presence, the survivors have managed to cling on to a sense of cohesion and mutual purpose. Yet more needs to be done.
8197 : I shall begin making provisions for our forces to deal with Alfard.
8198 : Once you have seen to the wyverns, I ask you to bring me % as proof of the deed. Luck ride with you!
8199 : You truly did it! You defeated the wyverns!
8200 : I cannot thank you enough, friend. The most grueling stage of the operation lies ahead of us still, but your valorous exploits have stoked the fires of our courage.
8201 : Should we succeed in vanquishing Alfard from these rolling knolls, hope will bloom within the people's hearts once more. And then perhaps Father might...
8202 : It...it is nothing. My thanks again, wayfarer. No words or objects would suffice to show my appreciation, but I want you to accept this all the same.
8203 : I've received intelligence that wyvern numbers are on the rise. Needless to say, the fiends must not be permitted to continue their reign of terror. Can we rely on your assistance once more, friend?
8204 : Is that so? For the sake of mankind, I pray that you reconsider.
8205 : You have our eternal gratitude, friend. Now, you go to face opponents you have previously bested, but on no account lower your guard, lest you succumb to your own complacency.
8206 : What? Do my ears play tricks? I-I dare not hope... Could you truly have...vanquished Alfard?
8207 : I...I can scarce believe what I'm hearing! Oh, Father will be over the moon to hear these tidings!
8208 : Why, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he were to hold an award ceremony in your honor on the morrow!
8209 : ...
8210 : Forgive me, I...I let myself get carried away. The good hope of your news put me in mind of former times. I don't believe I ever went into detail about Father's condition.
8211 : When the Abyssean hordes overran the Republic, in the span of but a few hours, Father witnessed enough bloodshed to last ten-score lifetimes.
8212 : Blaming himself for the deaths of the citizens--for failing to protect them as was his charge--he fell into a spiral of depression. Now he wages an ongoing struggle in the depths of his soul.
8213 : Truth be told, I'm deathly afraid...afraid of the pain and suffering that my inadequate leadership could cost us. Sometimes the responsibility is simply too much for these shoulders alone to bear. Oh, it'd give me so much heart if Father could return to his old self again...
8214 : P-please forgive me. I didn't mean to burden you with my insecurities.
8215 : I know full well that I must stay strong. After all, everyone--not the least of all, Father--is depending on me.
8216 : I'm in charge of the Resistance forces encamped here.
8217 : Just when we thought enduring peace was within reach, everything was torn from our grasp.
8218 : We don't know what manner of evil unleashed the cataclysm, but one thing is certain: never will we cease our struggle to survive.
8219 : Let us fight beside one another, you and I. Together, we can realize our shared dream of civilization restored.
8220 : We are in a wretched state. The Abyssean hordes wreak havoc on our forces without cease.
8221 : Our defense line cannot hold against their onslaught for much longer. We must take drastic action, and soon.
8222 : At present, our forces are keeping the Abyssean hordes at bay.
8223 : Nevertheless, we cannot afford to relax our vigil. We must redouble our efforts and take the battle to the enemy.
8224 : We've managed to turn the tables and force the Abyssean hordes onto their back foot...or whatever loathsome appendage they have. We must keep throwing our strength against them and consolidate this hard-won advantage.
8225 : Our unwavering offensive strikes fear into the hearts of the enemy.
8226 : It won't be long now before we hold this area completely under our sway. Let us ride this tide all the way to victory!
8227 : The Abyssean threat lies subdued under our heel. Our task now is to ensure that it remains that way for good.
8228 : Commandant Zeid's inspiring leadership instills hope and courage in one and all.
8229 : The grisly scar he bears on his forehead...I wonder where he sustained it.
8230 : We, the remnants of the Ducal Guard, consider it our mission to purge the area of Abyssean fiends.
8231 : Needless to say, this is an uphill struggle, and we can never have enough willing sword arms. Pray lend us yours, friend.
8232 : Curse those Abyssean fiends... Their strength is even greater than first anticipated.
8233 : They have forced us into the corner. Unless we can break their impetus, our cause is doomed. I implore you! Help us stay the enemy's vicious onslaught!
8234 : Our defenses stand firm against the enemy, yet we cannot content ourselves with this situation.
8235 : Victory can never belong to the besieged--no gust of wind will drop this sweet fruit into our palms. No, we must seize it of our own accord, even if it can be reached only from atop a mountain of slain Abyssean fiends.
8236 : We've managed to win a foothold in our fight against the Abyssean fiends. On no account must we relinquish this gain. We press onward!
8237 : We're well-positioned to deliver the killing blow. The enemy's turn to know fear is come!
8238 : Our efforts have finally borne fruit. So long as we remain vigilant, the Abyssean hordes will terrorize Grauberg no more.
8239 : On my honor as a Ducal Guard, I will make those vile fiends rue the day they crawled out from the bowels of Abyssea!
8240 : Mistress Cornelia is acting captain of the brigade in the president's stead.
8241 : Circumstance has thrust a great burden upon her young shoulders. It's all I can do to beseech brave souls such as you to assist in our cause.
8242 : The Abyssean hordes press us with unnerving ferocity. Our defenses are on the verge of collapse.
8243 : Please, you must help us repel the enemy! Our very survival is at stake!
8244 : Does the enemy's thirst for destruction know no bounds? We beat them back time and again, yet there seems to be no end to them.
8245 : If only we can gain enough purchase in the struggle to launch an offensive...
8246 : We've begun to gain ground against the enemy. Now is the time to strike such a blow that would send the fiends scurrying back to their lairs!
8247 : Our valiant soldiers are pressing the enemy hard.
8248 : Let us continue to rally together and show the Abyssean fiends the power of unity!
8249 : Our tenacity and strength of spirit have seen the Abyssean threat defanged! Let us see to it that the enemy is permitted no means to rise again!
8250 : Hrrrm... I say, however did an academic such as me end up at the helm of a military outfit?
8251 : Well, perhaps it's to the good. Knowing is half the battle, after all, and knowledge is something I do not want for. Now, I just require strapping young fighters like you to take to the front line.
8252 : Hrrrm! Our forces are on the receiving end of heavy punishment!
8253 : You! Don't just stand there looking like a tree! Jump into the fray and fell a fiend or three! That's an order!
8254 : The Abyssean hordes harry us still, but I'm observing some wariness in their movements.
8255 : This is a golden chance to shift out of our defensive posture and repay the enemy in kind!
8256 : We've managed to gain a footing with the Abyssean hordes. The time is come for us to show our true steel!
8257 : Go forth, my loyal minions, and show the enemy no quarter!
8258 : Mwahaha! We have the Abyssean fiends cowering at the mere sound of our approach!
8259 : Victory is no longer a question of if, but when. Go forth, my loyal minions, and lay waste to our foes!
8260 : Mwahaha! The Abyssean fiends are completely at our mercy! Squirm though they might, there will be no escaping my iron grip of subjugation! Heaheaheaheahhh!
8261 : It feels like another lifetime that I was training at the Orastery. It was all fun and games back then, to be honestaru.
8262 : I never imagined I'd one day need to ply my skills for the very survival-wival of mankind.
8263 : <Sigh> If only I had known that monsters would overrun the world, I would've applied myself bettaru in class.
8264 : You see those glowing emblems over yonder? They're searing wards, magical barriers that keep hostile creatures at bay.
8265 : You've nothing to fear so long as you stay within their perimeter, but it's a whole new world of savagery beyond. A not-so-fantastic point of view.
8266 : If you absolutely must leave the safety of the wards, you must first receive permission from the conflux surveyor in the form of visitant status.
8267 : If you've a mind to spill the blood of Abyssean fiends, you'd do well to heed my advice.
8268 : The creatures are drawn to clamor. You do not want to engage them overlong in a single area, lest you become overwhelmed by uninvited guests.
8269 : But there's no call for panic, even if the situation turns grim. The nastiest fiends lash out only when threatened, you see, so you won't come to harm if you don't give them cause for ire.
8270 : Who are you supposed to be, hm? It's nothing personal, but I don't have time to waste on strangers.
8271 : Hm? You're called %, you say? I might've heard that name somewhere before...but perhaps I've mistaken you for another.
8272 : Either way, it's naught to me.
8273 : Ah, so you're the one called %. I've heard the odd tale about you.
8274 : What kind of tales, you ask? I'm afraid the details escape me, but they were positive for the most part, I think.
8275 : Greetings, %. It's always a pleasure speaking with you.
8276 : Your efforts have earned you respect among the survivors in Grauberg. Keep up the good work, you hear?
8277 : Ah, %. I was wondering when you'd next pay a visit.
8278 : Through your selfless deeds, the survivors have come to hold you in high esteem. On behalf of the folk of Grauberg, I'd like to offer you my thanks.
8279 : Why, %! Your visit does me great honor!
8280 : It would be no exaggeration to call you the beating heart of our community. We simply couldn't get by without your inspiring presence!
8281 : G'day, mate. Come to check on your progress for this area, have ya? Well then, treat yerself to a good eyeful:
8282 : Looks like you've completed this objective. You can give yerself a pat on the back for that.
8283 : Crikey, you've completed all objectives in the area! That's something to write home about, I reckon!
8284 : Here's a little reward for ya, mate, just to show our appreciation.
8285 : Stay sharp out there, eh? Else you'll end up bein' tucker for them Abyssean nasties.
8286 : Do you know what cruor is, friend? It's a shiny red granule found as mineral deposits upon the body of Abyssean fiends.
8287 : Being a potent energy source needed to power veridical confluxes and a host of other things, cruor quickly became adopted as a currency of sorts post-cataclysm.
8288 : If you come into any cruor, you'll want to seek out the cruor prospector. He offers a variety of helpful items and services in exchange for the mineral.
8289 : Hm? Who do you presume to be, pray?
8290 : I am a busy man, and would thank you to leave me in peace.
8291 : These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes. Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.
8292 : I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.
8293 : I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos. Would you be needing something of me?
8294 : Need something? Assist with replenishment. Assist with upgrades. Martellos? Come again? Nothing in particular.
8295 : Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort. To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these % into the structure.
8296 : Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and % at the same time.
8297 : Take along the %? Yes. No.
8298 : We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations. Best of luck in your efforts!
8299 : Why, is that not % already in your posssesion? You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.
8300 : I see that you currently possess %. Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?
8301 : You return the % and obtain % in its stead!
8302 : Your support is most heartening in these dark times. Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as %.
8303 : Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy. You will not be able to carry it and % at the same time.
8304 : Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better. Be careful out there!
8305 : Hm? Is that not % you hold in your hand? You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.
8306 : Is that % I see? Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?
8307 : Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that % off your hands. How did you fare in your efforts?
8308 : I see, I see... Martello #0#, you say? It sounds as if the operation was [a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]
8309 : The resistance greatly values your contributions. Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.
8310 : I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high. Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.
8311 : Ask something? So, what's a martello? Martello replenishment. Martello upgrades. Cautionary notes. Not now.
8312 : The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war. Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.
8313 : You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.
8314 : In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.
8315 : This % is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers. Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.
8316 : That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.
8317 : I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel. Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word. Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.
8318 : Feast your eyes on this %. She's a beauty, isn't she? Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.
8319 : An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations. Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.
8320 : Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex. As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.
8321 : % are quite large and unwieldy. Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and % at the same time.
8322 : Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.
8323 : 'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...
8324 : Warning: Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
8325 : Your % has been lost.
8326 : The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage. Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.
8327 : The % breaks!

8361 : Greetings, friend. I am charged with recruiting able-bodied warriors for Dominion Ops under Captain [Wolfgang/Cornelia/Tosuka-Porika]'s jurisdiction. If my soft-spoken nature doesn't strike you as particularly sergeant-like, it is because I'm still new to my role. But I digress. You've come to lend your sword arm to the cause, I trust?

10416 : You have signed on for Dominion Ops!

10469 : That is all.
10470 : As our sphere of influence expands, so too will spirit rise among our troops. In turn, this boost in morale leads to an overall improvement in the performance of our forces, granting us various advantages against the enemy.
10471 : Current morale benefits: Finish viewing. MP/HP bonus: Lv.# Attribute bonus: Lv.# Increased EXP yield: Lv.# Increased cruor yield: Lv.# Increased pyxis discovery: Lv.# High-grade pyxis discovery: Lv.# Increased treasure yield: Lv.# None.
10472 : Are you certain? Yes. No.
10473 : Cancel your current Dominion Ops? Yes. No.
10474 : Ah, it appears you have returned from a successful mission! Well done, soldier!
10475 : You have completed your Dominion Ops objective!
10476 : What will you ask about? Nothing right now. Dominion Ops. Sphere of influence. Completing an objective.
10477 : Dominion Ops is the name given to Resistance operations whose objective is the suppression of the monster population.
10478 : Besides the detachment encamped here, two others can be found operating in the area. If you wish to partake in Dominion Ops, you may do so by speaking with either me or a fellow sergeant.
10479 : Likewise, you may report back to any one of us upon the successful completion of your objective, at which time you will be issued your reward for assistance rendered.
10480 : As long as he or she is in the same area, any sergeant is authorized to attend to your needs. Keep this in mind, and you won't waste precious time hopping between encampments.
10481 : Each Dominion Ops successfully completed slightly expands our sphere of influence over the Abyssean hordes.
10482 : Needless to say, our ultimate goal is complete and utter domination. Every individual effort counts!
10483 : Bear in mind, however, that the enemy will not be taking any of this sitting down. Do not be surprised if an especially fearsome fiend emerges in an attempt to thwart our efforts.
10484 : And unfortunately for us, the Abyssean fiends are confoundingly fertile. Their numbers will literally explode if left unchecked, in turn causing our hard-won sphere of influence to diminish.
10485 : As the sphere of influence directly influences troop morale, it is imperative that we do not slacken our efforts. We earnestly ask for your cooperation in keeping the area safe for all survivors.
10486 : To cancel an objective in progress, you must seek out one of the sergeants in the area.
10487 : The same applies if you wish to review your progress or report your success. In the case of the latter, you will also be issued your reward, which includes Dominion Notes, for assistance rendered.
10488 : Any notes you have earned may be taken to a Dominion tactician and redeemed for useful equipment and items.
10489 : Choose wisely! Set fame. Quest 1. Quest 2. Quest 3. Quest 4. Quest 5. Quest 6. Quest 7. Quest 8. Quest 9. Quest 10. Cancel.
10490 : Choose quest settings. Start: [off/on]. End: [off/on]. Cancel.
