6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

6914 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
6915 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.

6945 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6946 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6947 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6948 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6949 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6950 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.

7254 : Having come from a different plane of existence, your existential phase is unaligned to that of Abyssea. To overcome this problem, % is required. It acts as a stabilizing agent that aligns and anchors your essence to Abyssea for prolonged periods of time.
7255 : Bereft of its effect, your essence will become unraveled within a matter of minutes, after which you will be expelled to your own reality. Do make a habit of first coming to me upon arrival in Abyssea.

7262 : Many are the reports of positive things occurring while under its auspices, from a general upturn in fortunes to more specific benefits such as accelerated growth and greater ease of cruor harvesting.
7263 : Naturally, these benefits will not come to the idle. The gains have been observed to grow proportionately to one's exploits in Abyssea.
7264 : All good things come to an end, however, and this is no exception. The effects endure as long as you remain in Abyssea, but will wear off at the instant of your departure.
7265 : That concludes my explanation of the visitant status. Remember always to obtain the status upon arrival in Abyssea.

7276 : Greetings, traveler. I am a resistance officer whose charge is the procurement of cruor. If you would be willing to part with any cruor you possess, I will issue you with helpful items in return.
7277 : What will you do? (Cruor balance: #) Nothing. Learn about cruor. Exchange for items. Exchange for temporary items. Exchange for key items. Exchange for enhancement effects. Dispose of abyssite.
7278 : Cruor is a naturally occurring mineral found as deposits on creatures native to Abyssea.
7279 : Known by some as blood gold, these red granules are highly prized and see use as both energy source and construction material.
7280 : It would be no exaggeration to say that cruor is the lifeblood of the resistance effort. As a matter of fact, the bulk of items I have in stock are cruor-based.
7281 : Chief among them being ancient abyssite, a highly concentrated, doubly valuable form of the stone boasting diverse benefits.
7282 : Ancient abyssite has been observed to improve the fortunes and vitality of their possessors, not unlike a good luck talisman.
7283 : The most popular varieties offer extended visitant status time, accelerated growth, and myriad enhancement effects. Some are even said to improve luck, but such benefits can be troublesome to measure.

7326 : Well met, wayfarer. I am an Atma Infusionist, and from my title I trust you can glean my field of expertise. Those who possess % may come to me to have atma infused.
7327 : How might I serve you? You may not. Tell me about atma. Infuse me with atma. Examine infused atma. Purge atma. Reinfuse previous atma set. Select from recent history.
7328 : Atma is most accurately described as the crystalline agglomeration of an Abyssean creature's soul. Through painstaking research, we infusionists have discovered a way to imbue ordinary people such as yourself with its power.
7329 : Infusion makes possible the augmentation of individuals, granting them powers particular to the creature from which the atma is sourced.
7330 : The infusion process requires three objects: an atma, %, and cruor.
7331 : % is a rare variety of ancient abyssite that can only be procured with great difficulty. And it won't please you to know that atma is rarer still.
7332 : For only the most savage creatures, you see, are known to yield atma. And if you thought that weren't trial enough, only by employing special combat strategies will atma be yours to own.
7333 : Atma-yielding monsters are known to have vulnerabilities that, if exploited, may result in a swift end to the confrontation.
7334 : Strike at a foe's weakness, and it will drop different spoils, often more valuable than usual. Among them you may find atma.
7335 : The vulnerabilities can broadly be divided into three categories: magic attacks, physical-based weapon skills, and magic-based weapon skills.
7336 : For instance, there are monsters known to be weak against magic-based weapon skills. Inflicting such damage upon them will impair their movement, and you may consequently be rewarded with atma.
7337 : All living creatures, however, possess the capacity to adapt, and vulnerabilities have been observed to change. Be wary if you wish not to discover to your sorrow that a once-foolproof strategy no longer applies.
7338 : Besting such fell creatures is in itself a harrowing task, and becomes even more so if procuring atma is your objective.
7339 : But should fortune smile upon you and you find yourself in possession of atma, bring it here. I will see that it serves you well.

7364 : Have the selected atma infused? Confirm. Cancel.
7365 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with [his/her] chosen atma set!
7366 : Greetings. I am an atma fabricant--or, to the layman, one who fabricates atma. I can synthesize atma from the memories of adventure stored deep within your body and soul. If you have need of my services, you need only speak the word.
7367 : Ask for something? No thanks. Synthetic atma? My memories? Show me the atma.
7368 : As you are no doubt aware, the substance we call atma is a crystalline agglomeration of soul energy that can be harvested from the bodies of fallen Abyssean fiends.
7369 : The abundant power that it imbues when infused into our bodies is not in question. The perilous means by which it must be acquired, however, leaves something to be desired.
7370 : After all, bolstering the strength of one man means little if ten others must lose their lives in the process. Thus was the impetus behind our research: to discover a means for extracting atma from resources at our immediate disposal.
7371 : We experimented with nearly every substance in sight--be it animal, vegetable, or mineral. Yet each time, the atma produced was small, fragile, and entirely absent of the power we sought.
7372 : Then, one day, we hit upon the obvious answer that we had so long overlooked...ourselves. Yes, the atma extracted from our own bodies--particularly those richly possessed of experiences and memories--these housed a power rivalling that harvested from the most vicious of fiends.
7373 : If you possess such memories, then I can bring forth the latent power that resides within you as well.
7374 : Fear not, for there is everything to gain and nothing to lose. Save for some cruor, that is...
7375 : Curious, is it not? That potent physical energy can be extracted from such a tenuous, intangible thing...
7376 : But the strength our memories and experiences give us is real, if all too easily overlooked. Once isolated, it is simply a matter of recalling it, solidifying it, and bringing it to the fore.
7377 : Surely you understand of what it is I speak, yes? Your greatest accomplishments--those that make others stand in wonderment and admiration when you they hear your name.
7378 : We summon forth the energies from the deepest recesses of your psyche, and infuse it into the cruor you carry. The resultant agglomeration of organic mineral and soul energy is synthetic atma.
7379 : Mind you, the deeper and more puissant your energies, the more cruor will be necessary to contain it all. If you wish to have me assay the powers that lie dormant within you, simply speak the word.
7380 : Very well. We shall see what latent powers you possess. Stand still and clear your mind...
7381 : Yes...it is as I thought... Long and far have you traveled...many a battle have you fought...
7382 : Yes, I see within you # [memory/memories] that I could process into atma. Which shall I extract?
7383 : ...And yet, I see nothing tangible enough for me to process. I am sorry.

7678 : I'm a Resistance officer charged with overseeing the Dominion effort, and we're looking for a few good [men/women]. Since I don't see any around, it looks like you'll have to do.
7679 : Ask about something? Not now. General information. State of the Resistance. State of the enemy. Exchange Dominion Notes. Exchange battle trophies.
7680 : Ask about something? Not now. The Dominion effort...? How do I do my part? What's in it for me?
7681 : Wake up, soldier! I don't know if you're blind or stupid, but if you haven't noticed, there's a war going on around you.
7682 : The Resistance is locked in a bitter struggle to take back our rightful land from the hordes, and secure a future for our kind. We call this the Dominion effort. Has an inspiring ring to it, doesn't it, soldier?
7683 : And if you haven't noticed, we don't exactly have a surplus of personnel. Hell, I just got a field promotion from sergeant to tactician when my predecessor got his head lopped clean off by a fiend. Now they've got some sissy boy doing my old job, but do you hear me complainin'?
7684 : Anyhow, if you've got half a bloody stump of a leg to stand on and an arm to carry a blade, consider yourself recruited. Now listen up, soldier, because I'm only going to say this once.
7685 : I'll put this in terms even a dullard like you can understand. The enemy we face consists of two types of fiends: nasty ones, and even nastier ones.
7686 : We've got legions of ugly monsters prowling the land in throngs. We cut them down, and lure their even nastier buddies out of hiding.
7687 : These fiends are the beating heart of our enemy. Bring them down, and our battle is as good as won. Get it? Good. Now hop to it, soldier!
7688 : Hah! Ya may be short on wits, but you've got pluck. There may be hope for you yet, soldier.
7689 : If you're ready to make yourself useful, then you'll want to seek out one of our outposts. There's three in the area, so even a rookie like yourself should be able to stumble upon one of 'em by dumb luck.
7690 : Talk with a sergeant there, and sign up for one of our operations--Dominion Ops, we call 'em for short. Each op will involve exterminating a prescribed quota of a particular variety of fiend.
7691 : If you're halfway competent at your job, the Resistance will gradually expand its sphere of influence over the hordes. Our ultimate goal is complete domination against all manner of fiends. That's one hundred percent, soldier!
7692 : What if I just kill fiends without signing up for ops, you say? Don't give me any of that lip, soldier!
7693 : Listen. Every fiend you bring down will aid the cause. But we can't be certain that we've achieved complete domination unless you sign up for ops, and report your success to the sergeant. You'll also be rewarded for your efforts. Bet that got your interest quick, didn't it?
7694 : There's more, soldier. This may sound bloody obvious--well, maybe not to a lackwit like you--but success in your efforts will raise the spirits of our entire company.
7695 : With the resulting boost in morale, our troops will fight with even greater fervor, affording us all manner of advantages in battle. What kind of advantages? Hah! That's for us to know and you to find out, soldier!
7696 : Expand our sphere of influence over the peons, and we'll start to lure the big boys out of the woodwork.
7697 : Take them out, and the biggest, baddest foes will start to show up. Where does it all end, you say? It doesn't! This is war, soldier, not a Lightsday afternoon walk in the park!
7698 : Now, where was I? The enemy leaders pack a punch, but they rely on their flunkies as the foundation for their strength.
7699 : Cut their subordinates out from underneath them, and they won't have a leg--or gnarled, twisted appendage--to stand upon. That's smart fighting. And in war, you fight smart or you die, soldier!
7700 : I couldn't tell you how many of these buggers we're up against, but I do know this. Each one we kill brings us closer to our goal of utter domination.
7701 : To keep morale high, we can't let up the attack on the enemy leaders. You got all that, soldier?
7702 : What's in it for you? You've got some nerve, soldier!
7703 : You're here to follow orders, not question them! When I say jump, you say how many malms high, sir!? Are we understood, soldier!?
7704 : But yeah, there's somethin' in it for you, if that's the only thing that's going to get you fighting for our cause instead of sitting around on your lazy backside.
7705 : When you report back after completing an operation or successfully bring down a notorious foe, you'll be awarded remuneration in the form of something we call Dominion Notes.
7706 : These notes can be exchanged for supplies to serve you on the field of battle: equipment, medicine, and more. And we're not talking your run-of-the-mill items here. This is some impressive stuff. I daresay it's worth more than your life, soldier.
7707 : Bet that put a spark in your eyes, didn't it? What's more, bring back battle trophies--the severed heads and gore-stained limbs of the fiends you slay--and we will reward your accomplishments with guerdon.
7708 : There are five echelons of trophies in total. Slaying more powerful fiends will yield more prestigious trophies, which in turn will earn you more valuable guerdon.
7709 : Battle trophies can even be exchanged for each other. Multiple lower-echelon trophies can be upgraded to a single trophy of a higher echelon, or vice versa. If you've got half a brain inside that skull of yours, you'll take advantage of this to obtain the guerdon you desire.
7710 : The guerdon we offer consists of some of the richest spoils we've acquired in the course of the war--equipment augmented by powerful sorcery. What manner of sorcery, you ask? That's classified information, soldier!
7711 : And mind you, since they were magicked long before we got our hands on them, we have no way of altering the enchantment. In other words, you'll take what we give you, and you'll thank us for it, soldier!
7712 : Intelligence reports assess the Resistance's sphere of influence in this area at # percent.
7713 : We've received reports that Captain [Excenmille/Nanaa Mihgo/Volker]'s region is overrun with fiends. What are you waiting for? Get out there, soldier!
7714 : We've received reports that Captain [Maat/Romaa Mihgo/Zazarg]'s region is overrun with fiends. What are you waiting for? Get out there, soldier!
7715 : We've received reports that Captain [Wolfgang/Cornelia/Tosuka-Porika]'s region is overrun with fiends. What are you waiting for? Get out there, soldier!
7716 : Our most recent intel has it that we've felled # percent of the horde's most notorious fiends.
7717 : Our troops are currently reaping these morale benefits...
7718 : HP/MP bonus: Level #.
7719 : Attribute bonus: Level #.

7723 : High-grade pyxide discovery: Level #.
7724 : Increased loot yield: Level #.
7725 : ...None at all. Morale sucks, and you sure aren't helping by standing around here. Get out on the battlefield, soldier!
7726 : Morale's not bad, but it can always be better. Get out on the battlefield, soldier!

7804 : You return the % and obtain % in its stead!
7805 : Your support is most heartening in these dark times. Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as %.
7806 : Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy. You will not be able to carry it and % at the same time.
7807 : Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better. Be careful out there!
7808 : Hm? Is that not % you hold in your hand? You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.
7809 : Is that % I see? Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?
7810 : Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that % off your hands. How did you fare in your efforts?
7811 : I see, I see... Martello #0#, you say? It sounds as if the operation was [a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]
7812 : The resistance greatly values your contributions. Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.
7813 : I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high. Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.
7814 : Ask something? So, what's a martello? Martello replenishment. Martello upgrades. Cautionary notes. Not now.
7815 : The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war. Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.
7816 : You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.
7817 : In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.
7818 : This % is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers. Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.
7819 : That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.
7820 : I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel. Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word. Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.
7821 : Feast your eyes on this %. She's a beauty, isn't she? Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.
7822 : An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations. Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.
7823 : Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex. As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.
7824 : % are quite large and unwieldy. Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and % at the same time.
7825 : Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.
7826 : 'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...
7827 : Warning: Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
7828 : Your % has been lost.
7829 : The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage. Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.
7830 : The % breaks!
7831 : Table: #
7832 : Nothing happens...
7833 : You can feel the warm, moist breath of the maw on your skin.
7834 : An unseen force is drawing you towards the maw.
7835 : A portal has opened within the depths of the maw.
7836 : Raise your %? Yes. No.
7837 : You fit the % into the hollow.
7838 : There is a hollow here in the shape of %.
7839 : The lycopodium is entranced by a sparkling light...
7840 : Your memory is engraved with an image of your surroundings and the fragrance of flowers...
7841 : The ground is sparkling with a strange light.
7842 : The sparkling light seems vaguely familiar to you...
7843 : You sense that a certain trigger may awaken the memories slumbering in your mind.
7844 : The fragrance of the flower sends your senses reeling back to the world of the past...
7845 : The relevant battle data has been recorded in your %.
7846 : An unseen force is drawing you towards the maw.
7847 : Warp to Abyssea - [Dummy/La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Grauberg/Uleguerand]? Proceed. Not yet.
7848 : Warp to [Dummy/the La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/the Tahrongi Canyon/the Buburimu Peninsula/the Valkurm Dunes/the Jugner Forest/South Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/Xarcabard/Qufim Island]? Proceed. Not yet.
7849 : You do not possess %...
7850 : Your body cannot cope with further strain. You must rest for another # [minute/minutes].
7851 : To where will you head? [The past/The present]. Walk of Echoes. Nowhere for now.
7852 : Current progress: Ancient abyssite obtained: #/# Atma obtained: #/# Quests completed: #/# Return.
7853 : [Requirement/Objective completed]: Obtain all ancient abyssite found in this area.
7854 : [Requirement/Objective completed]: Obtain all atma found in this area.
7855 : [Requirement/Objective completed]: Complete all quests issued in this area.
7856 : In a world where the sun no longer rises, we have only the Torch to guide us through this dark, unending night. For as long as I stand here, Her flame shall ne'er gutter...
7857 : ...Yes? Who are you that disturbs my duties?
7858 : %? I cannot say that I am familiar with your name. Then again, my devoted service to the Torch demands my full attention.
7859 : You may call me Zauko, First High Priest of the Order of the Undying Flame. It is my life's calling to maintain the Torch and see that Her light shines upon us for as long as we abide in this realm.
7860 : My duties involve rising each day at the break of dawn--or what would be dawn, if we still had a sun in the sky--performing twenty obeisances at the turn of every hour, and watching over Her every waking moment to ensure that She still burns strong. Ah, and yes, making a periodic offering of this % should ever Her flame waver or sputter.
7861 : You, friend, seem like a [man/woman] of piety. Perhaps you would be willing to perform a service for our order.
7862 : This flame that I keep vigil over, you see, is not the only manifestation of Her glory. My fellow acolytes at two other chapters of our Order have informed me that their supplies of % are running perilously low.
7863 : Would you be willing to make these two deliveries for me, that Her Radiance might shine bright upon on all the land?
7864 : Take up the task? I shall. I shall not.
7865 : Wonderful! Your devotion shall not go unnoticed by Her Radiance. The % may be found in the casket beside me. Take it, and may She light your way...
7866 : Blasphemy! Would you see our realm engulfed by the Shadow!? Ah...but forgive me. Pray return should you have a change of heart.
7867 : Ah, and remember these words from the Tome of Light. Thou shalt avail thyself not of the confluxe, that heinous tool of Shadow, lest the source of Her power be fore'er quenched by unholy magicks. Consider it a part of the training that we must all endure in Her name.
7868 : Upon reaching each destination, you should see a casket similar to the one beside me. Deposit a portion of % within each, and your work shall be done. I shall notify my fellow acolytes of your impending arrival.
7869 : The % may be found in the casket beside me. Take it, and may She light your way...
7870 : You open the casket and deposit a pack of % within.
7871 : The casket contains an ample supply of %.
7872 : You cannot carry any more %.
7873 : There seems to be no need for replenishment at this time.
7874 : Welcome to the second outpost. We can't offer you much refuge from the cold, but you're free to rest awhile.
7875 : %, is it? Zauko told me to expect you.
7876 : You'll have to forgive his daft ramblings. Poor man hasn't been the same since the Duchy fell. Still, we appreciate the delivery of this %. You can deposit it right in the casket here.
7877 : Zauko takes his duties to an extreme, but it can't be denied that fire is a precious commodity in these parts. Both to shed light under these sunless skies, and to fend off the chill winds that blow ceaselessly. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
7878 : Hail, stranger. What brings you all the way to the third outpost? It must be a vital task indeed, for you to trek to such an inhospitable place as this.
7879 : Ah, %. Zauko gave me advance notice of your coming.
7880 : We appreciate your assistance. Well, you see the casket, don't you? Go right ahead and put that % in.
7881 : For a second there, I was afraid you'd start rambling about the Torch and Her divine Light like poor old Zauko. Precious few of the survivors have been able to keep their wits about them, what with the horrors they've seen...
7882 : We hail your safe return, [Brother/Sister]! My acolytes have sent word of your success. Know that your devoted service to Her Radiance shall not go unrewarded!
7883 : The divine Light of the Torch illuminates our cold realm anew, bringing us vision and warmth. But the Shadow is ever encroaching--pray lend us your aid again when the need should arise!
7884 : The Torch sputters and falters before our eyes, [Brother/Sister] %. Pray lend us your aid, lest Her divine light be snuffed out for all eternity...
7885 : The damage is even worse than we feared. If another one hits, it might mean the end for...
7886 : Yes? Is there something you need?
7887 : Ah, so you overheard my musings. Avalanches have been occurring with disturbing frequency in the eastern reaches of the range, you see, and I took it upon myself to uncover the cause.
7888 : And what do you suppose that cause might be? If you said earthquakes, you'd be correct!
7889 : It would seem that periodic tremors centered around an area due east of Bearclaw Pinnacle are causing accumulated snow to be displaced in mass quantities. Fortunately, I've devised a plan to mitigate the damage.
7890 : By periodically triggering small explosions before the snow has had a chance to accumulate, we can ensure that any avalanche that occurs is little but a harmless sluff.
7891 : There's only one catch. It's quite a perilous trek to the area where the explosives must be placed, and I injured my leg in the most recent snowslide. Would you be willing to perform the task in my stead?
7892 : Help out? Certainly. Certainly not.
7893 : A generous soul you are indeed. I shall entrust you with this set of three %--explosive devices that I've modified to be especially effective in displacing snow.
7894 : That's a shame. Well, perhaps my bum leg still has a few malms left in it... Unggghhh...or maybe not.
7895 : Through careful research, I have pinpointed three locations due east of Bearclaw Pinnacle where snowfall accumulates readily. It is there that I believe the explosions would achieve maximum effect.
7896 : All you need do is travel to each spot, prepare a % by loading its chamber with a suitable quantity of firesand, then bury it within the snowdrift. Do this thrice and your job is done.
7897 : How much firesand will suffice, you ask? An excellent question, but one to which there is no simple answer.
7898 : In areas of significant buildup, a small blast should be sufficient to set things in motion. A more potent explosion will be required in those places where accumulation is yet sparse. The exact quantity you will have to determine on your own. This is still a very inexact science, I'm afraid.
7899 : I will be handling the detonation remotely, so you need only report back to me when the mines have been loaded and set. That is, unless you have a burning desire to come tumbling down the slopes encased in a raging juggernaut of snow and ice. Ahahaha!
7900 : [Only the thinnest layer of snow covers the ground here/A fair quantity of snow has accumulated here/The large deposits of snow here seem ready to give way at any moment]...
7901 : What will you do? Nothing. Load firesand. Remove firesand. Set the %.
7902 : % [adds a small amount of firesand to the mine's chamber/removes a small amount of firesand from the mine's chamber].
7903 : % carefully sets the % in the snowbank.
7904 : The chamber of the % [contains only a pinch of firesand/contains a small lump of firesand/is filled halfway with firesand/is filled to the brim with firesand/is overflowing with firesand]...
7905 : A % has already been set here.
7906 : Your work's complete, is it? Wonderful! Well then, here goes nothing. Look out beloooooow!
7907 : Now if you'll excuse me a moment, I'll contact our lookout. (Furan-Furin? Furan-Furin, do you read me?)
7908 : (That's a roger-woger, boss! And I have to say, [that was a sorry-worry excuse for an explosion just now./that explosion was just perfect. An absolute beautaru!/have you lost your noggin-woggin!? Why, you almost blastarued me to pieces!])
7909 : It would seem [the blast was a bit on the weak side. Still, we've/we were right on the mark. We've/we may have overdone it a bit. Still, we've] gathered valuable data from this.
7910 : Feel proud, friend, for you've performed a great service for the survivors of Uleguerand today. Take this for your troubles!
7911 : Can't you see that I'm busy monitoring this area for signs of impending avalanchey-wanches? You can't? Well, I just told you! So keep quietaru, please.
7912 : Ah, so you're the sucker--ah, the brave volunteer come to set up the bomb for us, are you? Take care not to overdo it with the firesand, will you? The lastaru guy nearly blasted-wasted me off the side of a cliff!
7913 : Thanks to you, we've gathered valuable data. But our research is far from complete. We'd be much obliged if you could assist us again someday.
7914 : You were a huge help. Really, truly! Couldn't have done it bettaru myself, and that's saying something!
7915 : Our lookout says we've got significant snow accumulation east of the pinnacle. At this rate, it's only a matter of time until another avalanche strikes. Would you be kind enough to help us set some % again?
7916 : <Sniff>... Why, a moogle without a Mog House is like a Mithra without a tail, kupo! A Galka without a perpetually furrowed brow! A pamama au lait without pamamas...or lait! (What is lait, anyway?)
7917 : Surely you see my plight, Master!? Can I call you Master? Just for old times' sake?
7918 : Oh, thank you, Master! Now that we're friends, perhaps you could heed my ever-so-humble request, kupo.
7919 : I have a mind to manufacture myself a makeshift Mog House of sorts, but I lack for a most vital material! %, to be exact. Perhaps you could procure one for me, Master? Pretty, pretty please?
7920 : Help the poor moogle? Like I have a choice, kupo. Not today, kupo.
7921 : Oh, thank you, Master! What a beneficent and benevolent soul you are!
7922 : Why, certainly, Master. You are clearly a very busy [man/woman]. Pay no heed to this pathetic, pitiful moogle. Bereft of home and purpose in life, what does it matter if I...<shiver>...f-freeze to death out here...alone...friendless, f-forsaken and...<sniff>...forgotten, kupo-o-o-o...
7923 : I believe there should be some % in storage at one of the encampments. Steal one? What kind of a moogle miscreant do you take me for!? Why, it would just be a temporary loan, kupo!
7924 : It is stocked to the brim with %.
7925 : Splendid! Why, you're every bit the adventurer that my former master was! My master, who was l-lost...<sniff>...in the attack on...<sob>...
7926 : Ah, but forgive this maudlin moogle! I seem to have forgotten another most important material for my new Mog House. A %! Yes, a %, kupo!
7927 : It's absolutely essential! Indispensible! You should be able to find a supply around one of the encampments, just like last time. Please! I'm counting on you, Master!
7928 : That % is essential! Indispensible, kupo! You should be able to find a supply of it around one of the encampments, just like before.
7929 : Please! I'm counting on you, Master!
7930 : Oh, there I go again. Now, all I'll be needing is % and my new Mog House will be good to go, kupo. Yes, %. Didn't I mention that before?
7931 : Where can you find one, kupo? I fear that's beyond the knowledge of this humble, homeless moogle. But I trust in you implicitly! Go forth and you shall find your fortune, Master!
7932 : All I'll be needing is % and my new Mog House will be good to go. Yes, of course this is the last of it, kupo! Would I ever mislead you, master?
7933 : I fear you won't be finding a supply around camp this time. but this shouldn't present a problem to an able adventurer like yourself, kupo!
7934 : Do my snow-blinded eyes deceive me, or is this truly a % you've brought to me? Why, wherever did you find this?
7935 : Why, I had assumed that I had merely sent you out on a wild goobbue cha-- Ahem, kupo!
7936 : I now have everything I need to manufacture a magnificent new Mog House for my new master--that would be you, of course! Now where did I put my hammer, kupo...?
7937 : On second thought, this might take some time. In the meantime, you can have this, kupo!
7938 : (I could tell you what I'm doing here, but then I'd have to kill you. And I don't suppose you'd enjoy that very much.)
7939 : You'd do well not to meddle in my affairs if you... ...Wait a minute.
7940 : Yes...perhaps you could be of service to me. What say you?
7941 : Offer your aid? Gladly. I think not.
7942 : Excellent. You may call me Tyamah. And you are %, correct?
7943 : How do I know your name...? I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. That wouldn't be pleasant--at least not for you--so let's just get down to business.
7944 : I have been charged with investigating the current condition of the four nations of Altana...or what remains of them.
7945 : By whom and for what reason are matters not of your concern. I seek of you answers, not questions.
7946 : No matter how inconsequential they may appear to your untrained eyes, any and all details are vital to those who employ my services. Uncover what you can, and I will see that you are rewarded for your efforts.
7947 : The horrors I saw that day have been burned into my memory. The Great Star Tree engulfed in flames...its verdant branches cracking and plummeting to the earth as women and children shrieked and fled in terror... Would that it were only a bad dream, but no...it was all too real.
7948 : Heahaehhah! ...Then an airship...<giggle>...crashed right into the Metalworks! Not a moment later, the drawbridge--Bastok's pride and joy--shattered and collapsed into the water! Bwahahaha! Me, crazy!? No, my friend. It is this world that has gone mad, not I...no, not I! Heaheahhaeheahahhah!
7949 : Yes, my young [lad/lass], I was not ten yalms from Victory Gate when it was breached by the hordes. Our glorious Victory Gate, that withstood even the devastating onslaught of Doggvdegg himself. 'Twas then I realized the end was near...
7950 : The clock tower came crashing down, then the bridge... My family, my friends...they were right behind me, and then...they were gone. Yet I survived... Why!? Why does the Goddess curse me so!?
7951 : Well? Was your reconnaissance mission a fruitful one? I hope it was...for your sake...
7952 : ...I see. I had my own suspicions, but this...
7953 : It would seem that not even the Empire is safe. And yet, I have no way to...<ahem>. But this is none of your concern.
7954 : At any rate, you've made yourself most useful. Take this in return.
7955 : I would not have expected to find a [brother/sister] of the path on these distant shores. Though it does little to avail us now...
7956 : Please leave me alone with my thoughts for a while. Unless you'd like me to kill you. That could be arranged.
7957 : You...! What was your name again!? Tyamah? No...that was...someone else... Bah! What difference does it make?
7958 : I have a task for you...for anyone! I need %...% of the most abnormal, unnatural Abyssean fiends!
7959 : Strange blobs suspended in midair! Snails that swim in the sky instead of the water! And more...yes, more... Where did they come from, and what do they want from me!? You must bring me their %...and soon...
7960 : Who said I needed your help!? What? I did!? Ah...then take % and some % out of those trunks you see there.
7961 : Equip yourself with a fiend and use it on the %. Or was it the other way around...?
7962 : What happened to me since we last met? Why, nothing! Nothing at all! I am in purrrfect command of my facul-waculties, kupo! Really, the nerve of you!
7963 : ...Now where did I put my turban!?
7964 : You won't help me? Help me do what? Who are you, anyway!?
7965 : Yes! Yes, this is one of the unholy creatures that calls to me in my sleep! But there are more! Yes, still more! What do they want from me!?
7966 : No, this is not one of the creatures that speaks to me in my dreams. It is far too...ordinary. You must...find them. They wait for me even as we speak!
7967 : What's this? You already gave me one of these! Have you gone completely daft? Good thing one of us still has his wits about him! Bwahahaha!
7968 : Even I'm not crazy enough to figure out what this is supposed to be. You'll have to try again.
7969 : Yes, these are unmistakably the fiends that I was looking for...
7970 : I must immediately report back to... Who was I working for, again?
7971 : In any event, take this. I don't remember how to use it, anyway!
7972 : The deeds you have performed for me today will not go forgotten.
7973 : It is no use...I have lost contact with my homeland. It appears I will be living out the rest of my days in this miserable wasteland... Fortunately, I still have my wits about me.
7974 : ...And you to keep me company, turban. Oh, promise me you'll never forsake my poor frostbitten head again! You won't? Oh, thank you, dear friend! Thank you!
7975 : Arrr... Of all the times to run out o' salve, this be a poor one, aye...
7976 : You there, matey. Ye look like ye know yer way around these here parts.
7977 : I be searchin' for a flower that blooms forth from the deepest, chillest snow. This be the key ingredient in the salve we survivors use to ease frostbite, gooseflesh, ague, and a whole mess o' clime-induced ailments, aye.
7978 : Ye wouldn't be opposed to retrievin' some for us, aye?
7979 : Aye? Aye. Sorry, I don't speak pirate.
7980 : Aye. I knew I'd not marked ye wrong.
7981 : Come again? Beg yer pardon, but I'm not quite understandin' ye, matey.
7982 : Ye may be callin' me Oruga of Norg...or formerly of Norg, aye. And yerself, matey?
7983 : ...%. A name as refreshin' as a brisk sea breeze, aye.
7984 : Ah, the sea! What this sailor wouldn't give to be reunited with those endless fields o' blue! The wind whippin' at me face and the briny ropes chafin' at me hands, aye...
7985 : Anyhow, as I meant to be sayin', I be lookin' for a suitable quantity o' %. Three or there'bouts should suffice, I'd wager.
7986 : Arr, that look o' surprise on yer face be as plain as a sail on a clear horizon, matey. Ye be thinkin', a salty sea maid like m'self and flowers make for a curious combination, aye?
7987 : Ever since me days in Norg, I be takin' an interest in rare flora, ye see. Merchants would sail in, bringin' rare specimens from far lands...
7988 : But those days be long past, and not like to return, aye...
7989 : A bright red flower blooms brilliantly atop the pure white snow.
7990 : No % remains here.
7991 : Aye, no doubt about it. They be %. And three o' them, no less.
7992 : This be all I need to be makin' the ointment we seek.
7993 : Ye've served us well, matey. Take this, and may fair winds blow at yer back, aye.
7994 : Delicate blossoms be bloomin' strong in this chill, windswept sea o' white. It be a message to all o' us, that though our hull may be breached and our sails tattered, we must never be givin' up the good fight, aye...
7995 : %. I be needin' yer aid again. Ye savvy?
7996 : Yours is a face I haven't seen before. What brings you to these parts, stranger?
7997 : Well, feel free to stick around. You'll be safe from the fiends as long as you stick close to me. Gahahaha!
7998 : Well, if it isn't %. I was startin' to wonder when you might show up.
7999 : How do I know your name, you ask?
8000 : Gahahahahahaha! Like there's anyone in this barren hinterland that hasn't heard your name by now. But let's talk about something more stimulatin', shall we?
8001 : Perhaps you've heard of the fiend that they call the Blanga. A fearsome beast it is, said to be able to rend a fully armored man limb from limb with its gnarled claws.
8002 : Why, the foul thing descended upon my band just the other day. We were able to drive it off, of course, but not before it had made off with our linkpearl. Needless to say, the ability to communicate with our comrades is vital in these harsh environs.
8003 : Retrieve the pearl? Consider it done. Do it yourself!
8004 : Gahahaha! That's the % I've heard so much about!
8005 : I would have long since gone myself, of course, but I need to stay here and intercept any potential attacks on the survivor camps.
8006 : But with the job in your hands, it's as good as done, right? Good luck out there, %. Gahahaha!
8007 : Gahahaha! You've sure got some nerve! That's what I like about you, %. Come back if ya change your mind, okay?
8008 : Surely you haven't forgotten the name of your quarry, have ya? The Blanga! Why, even now the beast's just waitin' for you to cut him down to size. Gahahaha!
8009 : Well, look who's back, and lookin' no worse for the wear, to boot!
8010 : Let's see here... No, this won't do at all.
8011 : Look for yourself...it's broken! Just like the oversized snout of the last fiend that thought he could get past ol' Zazarg. Gahahaha!
8012 : Ah, don't look so glum, %. It's no fault of your own, after all.
8013 : Besides, I'm just glad to have it back as a memento of my brothers in arms. A stronger and more valorous band you'll never see. They'll have no troubles holdin' their own without me.
8014 : ...And you'd be right at home among them, %. Come to think of it, it's as if we've met somewhere before... Nah, must just be my imagination.
8015 : ...And you'd be right at home among them, %.
8016 : Anyhow, you have my thanks and more, for livenin' up what was going to be another dreary day in the boondocks.
8017 : Well, I should let you be on your way. Bet you can't wait to jump back into the thick of things, after all.
8018 : Gahahahaha!
8019 : As I hear it, the Empire's in rough shape these days too. Too bad there's only one Zazarg to go around! Gahahahaha!
8020 : ...Still no contact. If this persists, we'll have a serious situation on our hands.
8021 : You. You are %, yes? I have heard much of you.
8022 : Time is of the essence, so I will be brief. I have lost contact with my three scouts.
8023 : Without their reports, we are all in grave danger. We must find them. Will you aid?
8024 : Search for the scouts? I will. I will not.
8025 : Excellent. You have my thanks.
8026 : ...Then leave me.
8027 : As I said a moment ago, the scouts are three. Cannau, dispatched to the northwestern reaches, Olavia in the southeast, and Wanzo-Unzozo, who last reported from north of Bearclaw Pinnacle.
8028 : I await word of your success.
8029 : Is something the matter?
8030 : Because something is certainly the matter with me...my legs are positively freezing! You wouldn't happen to have % on your person, would you?
8031 : Splendid! Warms the legs and the heart, I do say. Which reminds me, I should be getting back in touch with Rondipur, shouldn't I?
8032 : Rondipur gave me a good chewing-out. The gall of that man! If he wanted me to be more industrious in my duties, he should have outfitted me with more than a pair of shabby subligar. Do you not agree!?
8033 : Yeees? Is something the mattaru?
8034 : I say, it's posi-wositively freezing, wouldn't you say? I don't suppose you've seen anything around that could be used to startaru a nice, cozy fire, have you?
8035 : %! With this I can start a fire to keep myself toasty-woasty and cook up a piping hot dinner! Rondipur? Oh, yes, I'll contactaru the old bore sooner or later.
8036 : %! Wherever did you find this? Now I can start a fire to keep myself toasty-woasty and cook up a piping hot dinner! Rondipur? Don't worry, I'll contactaru the old bore sooner or later.
8037 : Ta-taru! See you 'round!
8038 : Now I can start a fire to keep myself toasty-woasty and cook up a piping hot dinner! Rondipur? Don't worry, I'll contact the old bore sooner or lataru.
8039 : Rondipur chewy-wewed me up good and proper. The nerve of that man! He could go a long way toward improving morale if he'd provision us with something tastier than buffalo jerky to eataru!
8040 : Yes? Did you want something from me?
8041 : Curse my luck! I spotted the mammoth tiger-beast my superiors had briefed me on, but lost sight of him in a blizzard. We have reason to believe he vanished off to the north. Would you be so kind as to investigate for me?
8042 : The snowbank is littered with half-gnawed animal carcasses.
8043 : Brrr...! A grisly sight. That's the work of the tiger-beast, no doubt. One can only hope that he's eaten his fill, and won't be coming back to feast on us for the nonce.
8044 : Speaking of hairy, cantankerous brutes, I should be reporting these findings back to Captain Rondipur, shouldn't I? Well, friend, be safe in your journeys!
8045 : Well, go figure. The old grouch actually praised me for my keen eye and dedicated efforts. I suppose it's easy to look competent compared to those other two slackers.
8046 : Oh, there you are. I'm pleased to inform you that I received reports from all three of my scouts. Of course, only Olavia had anything of import to share...
8047 : And even that was no doubt more your doing than hers. Take this as a reward for your efforts, friend.
8048 : I hope I can count on you to bring my scouts in line again, should the need arise.
8049 : Ah, there you are, %, and not a moment too soon. I suspect this will come as little surprise to you, but...
8050 : Just one moment, strrranger. You're not from around these parts, are you? I'd recommend you speak to the conflux surveyor over there. If ya haven't alrrready, that is.
8051 : He can prrrovide ya with somethin' called visitant status that'll make life here in Abyssea a good deal easier for ya.
8052 : Why, without it, you'll have a harrrd enough time just convincing people to talk to you. Don't take it perrrsonally--if you'd been through a cataclysm, you'd be pretty wary of chattin' with strangers too, don't ya think?
8053 : Oh, hullo there! I justaru picked up some incredibly valuable-waluable combat tips from Prince Trion himself. I can share this knowledge with you, if you wish.
8054 : Ask something? About weak points. About reinforcements. About killing blows. Nothing for now.
8055 : Prince Trion says that the fiends possess indi-windividual weaknesses. Take advantage of these, and you may deprive them of their most potentaru attacks, or even stop them dead in their tracky-wacks.
8056 : Of course, uncovering a certain creature's weak pointaru is easier said than done...
8057 : Is there anything else you'd care to hear?
8058 : Prince Trion says we must be wary when battling the fiends for too long in a single-wingle location. That they'll quickly call their friends, and those friends will be nasty enough to put your original foes to shame.
8059 : Fortunately, it appears these fearsome fellows have bettaru things to do than to pick on adventurers beneath their stature. If you find yourself intimi-wimidated, just leave them alone, and they'll do you the same favor.
8060 : Prince Trion says that when you fell a fiend, your visitant glow will take on different hues depending on how you strike the killing-willing blow.
8061 : Sadly, he didn't go into detail, so you'll just have to experimentaru for yourself.
8062 : Oh, did you hear him yourself? His voice does carry-warry quite far...
8063 : %? Can't say I've ever heard that name.
8064 : What did you expect? Those who live in chill, harsh environs such as these are slow to warm up to strangers.
8065 : But take heart. Do what you can to make yourself useful, and someday you might find yourself as beloved as me. Ahahaha!
8066 : %, you say? Yes, I may have overheard a person mention someone who claims he might have possibly known a fellow who spoke a name that almost vaguely resembles yours...though I cannot be sure.
8067 : Keep working as you are, and I'm sure the community will warm up to you before long. Even if you're not as charming as yours truly. Ahahaha!
8068 : %...? Yes, there's no mistaking it. That's a name I heard just this past day.
8069 : Why, [he/she] almost reminds me of a young Magriffon, the fellow said. Not half as brave and gallant, of course...but then again, who is?
8070 : %! You're quite the talk of the range these days. Seems your hard work has made quite an impression on the survivors.
8071 : Just between you and me, do feel free to take a break from playing [hero/heroine] all the time. There's no need to overshadow, er, a certain other prestigious personage. Would you not agree?
8072 : Ah, greetings, %. Always a pleasure.
8073 : Every time I hear your name--quite often these days, I must say--it brings to mind my own remarkable exploits. Exploits that people don't seem to be speaking much of these days...<sigh>.
8074 : Well, you've certainly done it, %. You've completely eclipsed yours truly in the hearts and minds of the survivors of Uleguerand.
8075 : I must admit: at first, I was more than a little jealous. But not anymore. We're truly fortunate that you arrived.
8076 : No doubt it's thanks to the % I acquired. I knew it was worth every last coin!
8077 : I can share with you the records of your exploits, if you're inclined to hear them. Or even if you're not, for that matter.
8078 : ...This here's what you've managed to accomplish.
8079 : Are my eyes to be believed!? Have you truly completed each and every task?
8080 : I believe this calls for a celebration. Take this, friend. You've certainly earned it.
8081 : The fiends are fierce in these parts, and the terrain's just as frightful. You'd do well to watch your back...and your footing.
8082 : Do you see that beautiful circle of swirling lights? We call it a searing ward.
8083 : Not only is it simply mesmerizing to gaze at--it also defends us from the hordes that roam the range. Where does its power come from? I haven't the faintest idea.
8084 : What I do know is that if you intend to venture beyond it, you'd be wise to speak with the conflux surveyor first. Fail to do so, and you'll find your excursion short-lived.
8085 : Greetings, friend. Have you ever seen a spinning pile of stones as beauti-weautiful as this one? I'll bet you haven'taru.
8086 : We call them veridical confluxes, you see, and what makes them even more beautiful is the power of teleportation they possess. I make it a point to activate each one I come across, and I would heartily-weartily suggest you do the same.
8087 : To utilize their powers, you'll also need a supply of cruor. But that shouldn't presentaru a problem to one of your skills, now should it?
8088 : Cruor, lovely cruor! You wouldn't happen to have any cruor for me, would you? Oh, pretty pretty please?
8089 : Then again, even if you did, you'd probably want to save it to trade for items. Or to power martellos and confluxes... If you were the rare person who didn't care about such things, however, your cruor could always find a home with me!
8090 : Before the cataclysm, I lived a peaceful life in Rabao. As much as I...ah-choo!...abhor the cold, we must be thankful that we still have our lives.
8091 : Just looking at Prince Trion's confident mien fills me with courage and resolve. Our kingdom may be lost, but so long as we have our royal scion, our spirit will ne'er be broken.
8092 : You see Romaa over there? She came racing-wacing all the way from Kazham the momentaru she heard the Federation was in danger. She's been through a lot, but she's been nothing but a true friend to us.
8093 : Zazarg was a big-time hero of the Republican Army back in the Great War. He went off on a journey to the Near East after that, but came back to fight for us when the hordes struck. That's loyalty for you there.
8094 : I had occasion to receive trainin' from old Maat just once. Don't remember how many years ago it was, but I've still got the bruises t' show for it. Ahahaha!
8095 : The hordes may have the upper hand, but we must not falter. Our unwavering courage will see us through to a brighter day.
8096 : You have sworn an oath to the Kingdom. I call upon you to honor that pledge today.
8097 : Together, we shall make those fiends rue the day they awakened the Red Lion!
8098 : Our counteroffensive has seen some success, but the fiends still hold the advantage here.
8099 : We must not let up! The hordes will run roughshod over our people no longer!
8100 : The enemy presence grows weak, their raids sporadic. The tide of battle has begun to turn in our favor.
8101 : But we must not allow ourselves to grow complacent. No, we strike while the iron is hot!
8102 : Ahahaha! The fiends cower and shrink from our blades! Mankind now holds the upper hand!
8103 : Follow me to battlefield, one and all! We shall take back our rightful land!
8104 : Hear me, one and all! Our enemy has gone silent!
8105 : We stand on the verge of our greatest triumph! May our victory taste as sweet as the Rolanberry 813 we shall drink upon our triumphant return!
8106 : Heh heh heh. These fiends pack a nasty punch, don't they?
8107 : Well, that means we just gotta punch back even harder! Go give 'em hell! Heh!
8108 : Looks like our foe's sportin' a few bruises.
8109 : You're puttin' up a good fight. Good thing, too, 'cause these old bones need a rest from time to time.
8110 : You've still got your youth, though, so keep poundin' away! Heh heh heh!
8111 : Good work! I do believe we've got the fiends on the run.
8112 : But this is no time to let up. We can't give 'em any opening to get back in the fight.
8113 : Good work, young'un. Our enemy's battered and bloodied.
8114 : Now's our time to hit 'em with all we've got. Let's leave 'em with bruises they'll carry to their graves! Heh!
8115 : Looks like we've given those fiends such a beatin' that they've all gone cryin' home to their mommies. Heh heh heh!
8116 : We may have won this bout, but don't even think about lettin' down your guard. Those fiends are nothin' if not unpredictable.
8117 : The fiends are strong, and numerous. I'll be frrrank with you--the odds are against us.
8118 : Grrr... It's just like it was in the Great War. But we were victorious then, and we can do it again!
8119 : We've put a dent in their rrranks, but they still outnumber us.
8120 : Do I need t' spell it out for you!? This is no time to be standing about. Get out there on the battlefield. We're fightin' for our futurrre here!
8121 : Finally, we've gained the upperrr hand.
8122 : But this is no time to rrrest on our laurels. Our job's not through until the last currrsed fiend has drawn its dyin' breath!
8123 : Can ya smell that in the air? That's the scent of our enemy's fear!
8124 : Victorrry is close at hand! We must strike like a cobra and sink our fangs deep into our foe's dark heart!
8125 : It's quiet here. Too quiet for my likin'...
8126 : We may have won the day, but we must rrremain ever vigilant. A desperate foe's a dangerrrous foe.
8127 : Gahahaha! So our enemies think they've already won, do they?
8128 : Let's teach them a lesson they'll never forget!
8129 : Gahahaha! Those fiends know now that this'll be no easy battle.
8130 : You guys pack more of a punch than I gave you credit for. Keep up the good work!
8131 : Gahahaha! Thanks to your efforts, we've put a good scare into our foe.
8132 : But don't go getting comfortable yet. The toughest fight still lies ahead!
8133 : Gahahaha! We've got the enemy on their last legs!
8134 : Show no mercy! Bury their bones deep in the snowdrifts of Uleguerand!
8135 : Looks like all our enemies have gone home. And just when I was gettin' warmed up! Gahahaha!
8136 : You're no slouch on the battlefield, friend! Let's hope it's not long before we can wreak havoc on a new brood of fiends together! Gahahaha!
8137 : It appears sturdily built.
8138 : The casket is stocked with %. A message scrawled on the lid reads: # cruor a pop! No freebies!
8139 : Purchase %?
8140 : You have # cruor. Purchase? Yes. No.
8141 : Purchase how many? (Maximum purchase: 12).
8142 : The total fee comes to # cruor. Make the purchase?
8143 : #### ####
8144 : Snow accumulation level: # Required firesand: 0->10-19, 1->20-29 2->30-39 Adjustment: #. Total amount: #
8145 : A sharp pair of eyes you have there, friend. Don't travel too far. I may have need of you before long.
8146 : A sharp pair of eyes you have there, friend. Yes, I believe I have just the job for you.
8147 : Feast those eyes of yours upon this parchment. These are plans for harnessing the fearsome explosive power of snolls, recovered from Xarcabard by my father during the Great War.
8148 : After the cataclysm, I made it my life's work to see this project to fruition, that we might strike back at the hordes with the shattering force of a thousand avalanches.
8149 : After months of painstaking research, all that stands between me and success is one final detonation experiment. An experiment in which you will be graciously serving as my assistant.
8150 : Worry not, friend. The experiment will pose little risk to your well-being...if conducted properly, that is.
8151 : So pray listen carefully. First, I will be entrusting you with a high-precision instrument.
8152 : You are to take it and make your way to the testing site located due north of here.
8153 : When you arrive, you are to set it--%, I call it--at the designated point of impact. Upon doing so, you will soon observe that snolls are drawn to its presence.
8154 : The % emits a light that, while invisible to our eyes, will affect the snoll in myriad ways. In addition to attracting their attention, it will also disrupt their internal biological workings, accelerating the process known as hypothermal combustion.
8155 : You are to make skillful use of this instrument and trigger an explosion as close to the impact point as possible.
8156 : Setting off explosions haphazardly will serve only to waste time and resources that we do not have. I have put down detailed instructions in writing to ensure that the experiment will proceed as intended.
8157 : When your work is done, retrieve the % and deliver it back to me.
8158 : I would collect the data myself if I could, but alas! The infirm body of a researcher is ill-suited for manual labor.
8159 : You are not the only one who has graciously agreed to aid in my work. Should you come across any of my other assistants in the field, you will no doubt find it beneficial to work as a team.
8160 : I await word of your success. Go in safety!
8161 : Ah, there you are, friend! Allow me to examine your %.
8162 : ...
8163 : Marvelous! It would seem the experiment was a success beyond even my wildest expectations! I truly cannot thank you enough.
8164 : Of course, my work is not yet complete. There are still improvements and adjustments to be made.
8165 : Promise me that I can count on your aid again.
8166 : ...I see. While not an outright failure, it would seem there is still considerable room for improvement.
8167 : The experiment was a failure!? You cannot be serious!
8168 : Fortunately, I have a spare set of instruments. Take this, and do try to be more careful this time.
8169 : Ah, there you are! And your timing could not be better. I am pleased to announce that preparations for my latest experiment are complete.
8170 : I trust you remember the procedure?
8171 : Do you remember? Of course! Uh, actually...
8172 : Shards of ice and blast marks indicate that this was the site of a snoll explosion...
8173 : You successfully set the %.
8174 : Frost Bomb Mk-II uses Hypothermal Combustion. The Impact Point takes # point[/s] of damage.
8175 : 'Twould appear that precision sliding on sheer-faced cliffs of solid ice is not such an easy task, after all...
8176 : Wait, do not tell me. %, is it not? Your reputation precedes you.
8177 : Perhaps you might be of service to us. Are you perchance familiar with Thousandfall Ridge?
8178 : A positively frightening land formation that has claimed the life of many a careless traveler, it is, and reported to contain a breeding ground for the hordes beneath the surface.
8179 : I have decided to send a regiment to clear out this foul den. The rub is that it is remarkably difficult to reach, requiring a precision cliff-sliding operation that is nigh impossible to perform unassisted.
8180 : It would be a great help to us if you could assist my scouts with their landing procedure.
8181 : As you may know, there are two slopes suitable for sliding.
8182 : Stationed at the southern and western slopes you will find two of my men, Nachou and Perfaumand.
8183 : They alone have successfully navigated this treacherous course thus far.
8184 : Speak with them, and they will surely have invaluable advice for you.
8185 : Which slope you assist with is a choice I leave entirely to you. Now go forth and serve the Resistance, %!
8186 : You've returned. How go your efforts?
8187 : I see. This may not be much, but please accept it as a token of our gratitude.
8188 : I intend to send another unit into the breach before long. I would be honored if you could assist us again.
8189 : I see. 'Tis unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected.
8190 : My men are making the long trek back up the mountain as we speak. There is naught to do but wait for their return.
8191 : Ah, a familiar face.
8192 : We are in need of your assistance in sending another unit into Thousandfall Ridge. Pray head to the slopes, and quickly.
8193 : You're quite the accomplished mountaineer to make it this far. Yes, my men could learn a thing or two from you, I think.
8194 : So you're the one who's come to assist us in our approach? This is excellent news.
8195 : When I give the signal, ten of our men will come sliding in this direction.
8196 : Should any of them veer off course, you are to extend a helping hand and guide them back in the proper direction.
8197 : ...My apologies. It would seem that not all of my men have finished their preparations. Pray come back in a short while.
8198 : Very well, let us begin the operation. Remember, you must keep them on the proper course!
8199 : Keep our soldiers on the proper course, I say!
8200 : Incredible! An unqualified success, and it's all due to your efforts, %.
8201 : Fair work, %. # [man/men] missed their target, but other than being a bit shaken, [he/they] should be none the worse for wear. In fact, I daresay the climb back up will do [him/them] some good.
8202 : I will pass along word of your success to Michilca. She will have a suitable reward for you.
8203 : This will not do at all. With such a small regiment, we will be the easiest of pickings for the fiends that lurk within. No, there is no choice but to attempt the operation again when all our soldiers have returned.
8204 : The journey back up will be long and slow. In the meantime, you should report the failure of the operation to Michilca.
8205 : Beginning slide ##.
8206 : Slide complete.

10297 : Difficulty: [////]
10298 : Undertake this objective? Yes. No.
10299 : Excellent! I will immediately see to the tedious but necessary paperwork. After all, we sergeants are nothing if not organized. In the meantime, I wish you the best of luck out in the field!
10300 : You have signed on for Dominion Ops!
10301 : You have canceled your objective.

10353 : That is all.
10354 : As our sphere of influence expands, so too will spirit rise among our troops. In turn, this boost in morale leads to an overall improvement in the performance of our forces, granting us various advantages against the enemy.
10355 : Current morale benefits: Finish viewing. MP/HP bonus: Lv.# Attribute bonus: Lv.# Increased EXP yield: Lv.# Increased cruor yield: Lv.# Increased pyxis discovery: Lv.# High-grade pyxis discovery: Lv.# Increased treasure yield: Lv.# None.
10356 : Are you certain? Yes. No.
10357 : Cancel your current Dominion Ops? Yes. No.
10358 : Ah, it appears you have returned from a successful mission! Well done, soldier!
10359 : You have completed your Dominion Ops objective!
10360 : What will you ask about? Nothing right now. Dominion Ops. Sphere of influence. Completing an objective.
10361 : Dominion Ops is the name given to Resistance operations whose objective is the suppression of the monster population.
10362 : Besides the detachment encamped here, two others can be found operating in the area. If you wish to partake in Dominion Ops, you may do so by speaking with either me or a fellow sergeant.
10363 : Likewise, you may report back to any one of us upon the successful completion of your objective, at which time you will be issued your reward for assistance rendered.
10364 : As long as he or she is in the same area, any sergeant is authorized to attend to your needs. Keep this in mind, and you won't waste precious time hopping between encampments.
10365 : Each Dominion Ops successfully completed slightly expands our sphere of influence over the Abyssean hordes.
10366 : Needless to say, our ultimate goal is complete and utter domination. Every individual effort counts!
10367 : Bear in mind, however, that the enemy will not be taking any of this sitting down. Do not be surprised if an especially fearsome fiend emerges in an attempt to thwart our efforts.
10368 : And unfortunately for us, the Abyssean fiends are confoundingly fertile. Their numbers will literally explode if left unchecked, in turn causing our hard-won sphere of influence to diminish.
10369 : As the sphere of influence directly influences troop morale, it is imperative that we do not slacken our efforts. We earnestly ask for your cooperation in keeping the area safe for all survivors.
10370 : To cancel an objective in progress, you must seek out one of the sergeants in the area.
10371 : The same applies if you wish to review your progress or report your success. In the case of the latter, you will also be issued your reward, which includes Dominion Notes, for assistance rendered.
10372 : Any notes you have earned may be taken to a Dominion tactician and redeemed for useful equipment and items.
