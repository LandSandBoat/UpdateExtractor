10 : Then move along.
11 : Good. This is your first time going on a mission, is it not?
12 : Your first assignment is not a difficult one. The details are as follows:
13 : You must go to the Zeruhn Mines in the western section of the Mines District. Once there, you are to collect a report from the overseer.
14 : You can consult the Mission section of the main menu to review your objectives. Speed and efficiency are your priorities. Dismissed.
15 : The Chief Engineer is conducting new research, and has asked for someone to assist him. He can be found in the Metalworks, to the east of the administrative section.
16 : The Chief Engineer's laboratory is on the second floor of the Metalworks. You don't know his name!? And you call yourself a Bastoker!

29 : Have you heard of a strange structure called the Crag of Dem? It is on the Konschtat Highlands, north of the Gustaberg Mountains.
30 : They say that crystals are drained of their power if you take them to a certain section of that structure.
31 : Chief Cid is currently investigating this strange phenomenon, and is asking for someone to bring back a faded crystal.
32 : Go see him for a more detailed explanation of your objectives.
33 : You want a crystal to use for this experiment? Are you not an adventurer? It should be easy for you to procure one.
34 : You are to collect % from beasts in the Dangruf Wadi.
35 : Senator Alois is in need of some. Do not ask me why. He can be found in the President's Office.
36 : You've acquired quite a reputation. There is a new mission for you to tackle.
37 : First, speak to Sir Naji of the Mythril Musketeers at the President's Office. This mission is of great import to the welfare of our nation.
38 : I see you've made it back safely from your journey to Windurst and San d'Oria. This new mission should not be hard for an experienced adventurer like you.
39 : The Mythril Musketeers are planning an offensive on the Quadav stronghold.
40 : Adventurers, including yourself, have been asked to join them on this operation.
41 : You are to go meet Iron Eater, one of the Mythril Musketeers, to receive a full briefing.
42 : The Gusgen Mines in the Konschtat Highlands have been dug to the bare rock and abandoned for some time...
43 : But lately, there have been reports that a rare ore can be found in them. No one has claimed this new vein yet.
44 : You are to bring back a sample of the ore to confirm these reports. A Galka adventurer named Davyad should be able to help you. He is said to have acquired a chunk of the ore when he was there last.
45 : The item that Davyad brought back was %. That is what you should seek as well. Once you have the ore, hand them over to me or one of my colleagues.
46 : You have succeeded in bringing back %. Good work, adventurer. This discovery may help rejuvenate Bastok's economy!
47 : You have heard of Jeuno, have you not? The Bastokan government is currently looking for someone to send there, and your name is on the list of candidates.
48 : The presidential aide, Sir Lucius himself, recommended you. It is a great honor--you should be proud!
49 : Sir Lucius wishes to see you as soon as possible. Go meet him in his office in the administrative section at the top of the Metalworks.

6702 : # #
6703 : (...Yeah, that's what I said!)
6704 : (But you know what? Oh, wait. Hold on...)
6705 : I'm sorry, can I help you?
6706 : % points to the item in 's hand.
6707 : Oh, this? It's a magical shell called %.
6708 : You want to know about %? Let me tell you all about them!
6709 : What do you want to ask? What's %? What types of % are there? How do you use them? Never mind.
6710 : These magic shells are full of mysteries...
6711 : You can get beautiful pearls from them. Some say these are some new form of shall shells, but...
6712 : Even if you take out a pearl, they make more and more of them. Strange, isn't it?
6713 : What's more strange is that pearls taken from the same shell actually transmit sound, no matter how far apart they are!
6714 : So, if you speak into one of the pearls, people who hold other pearls or the shell they were made from can hear you!
6715 : It's as if they were linked by an invisible thread... Huh. I guess that's why they have "link" in their names.
6716 : So anyway, the shells are called %, and the pearls %.
6717 : There are also different types of %.
6718 : Is there anything else you want to know?
6719 : What do you want to ask about? %. %. %. %. Back.
6720 : % are % when you first buy them at the store.
6721 : Once opened, they start making % and become the communications tool everyone's using.
6722 : You can set the color and name of your % when you open it. Make sure to set the ones you like because you can't change them afterwards!
6723 : % are % that have been opened and function as a communications tool.
6724 : You can make % and % from those shells. They're like the party leader of an adventuring party.
6725 : All items created by your % retain the %'s color and name.
6726 : Make the name something unique so that it's easy to remember.
6727 : % are pearls that % make.
6728 : If you equip one, you can communicate with people who have the same % and the % they were made from.
6729 : They're like the party members in an adventuring party.
6730 : % is a bag full of %. You can make one by metamorphosing a % for that purpose.
6731 : It won't have all the features of %, but you can take out an endless amount of % like %.
6732 : You have to use % to make %. The same goes if you want to turn it back into %.
6733 : They're like the party leaders of an alliance of adventuring parties...
6734 : You want to know how to use them? Where should I start?
6735 : What do you want to know about? Where to get one. Assigning a color and name. Making %. Equipping them. Speaking into them. Metamorphosing %. Throwing them away. Back.
6736 : You can buy % in shops. They're a little pricey, though.
6737 : It might be best if you ask friends who want pearls to chip in.
6738 : A freshly bought % has neither a color nor a name.
6739 : % becomes usable only after you've chosen its color and given it a name. Then you can use it to make %.
6740 : You can combine different amounts of blue, red, and green to make your shell's color. You can only use alphabet letters for the name, but you can use capital and lowercase letters anywhere you want.
6741 : % are made from %.
6742 : Making them is easy. Just equip your %, then go to Linkshell in the menu and select Create Pearl!
6743 : All % made this way retain the %'s color and name, so it's easy to tell who can hear you!
6744 : You can make as many % as you want, whenever you want, so don't worry about making too many of them!
6745 : You can also make % with % the same way.
6746 : Oh, and...you use your % to make %, too, but it's a little complicated so I'll tell you later.
6747 : You have to equip % for it to have any effect.
6748 : Go to Linkshell from the menu, choose the % you want to equip, and you're all ready to go.
6749 : It's a little different from equipping weapons and armor.
6750 : After you've done this, an icon that represents what you've equipped will appear beside your name. This is where the color you chose becomes visible.
6751 : If someone checks you in this state, they will be able to see the name of the % you have on.
6752 : Follow the same steps to equip % and %.
6753 : To speak into %, change your chat mode to linkshell, and whatever you say will be heard by everyone who has the same link.
6754 : You can also type /linkshell and type your message. The shorter version is /l (lowercase L for linkshell).
6755 : Ah, but of course, you have to have %, %, or % equipped first.
6756 : Whatever you say will only be heard by people who have the %, %, or % with the same link.
6757 : So if you want to stop listening to your link, all you have to do is unequip your %, %, or %.
6758 : % can metamorphose other people's % and %. Of course, it can only affect those that were made from the same %.
6759 : There are two types of metamorphoses, which are:  1: Make into sack / Make into pearl  2: Kick.
6760 : Both need the target % or % to be equipped at the time.
6761 : Make into sack / Make into pearl makes the target % into % and vice-versa.
6762 : It's useful if you want someone else to take care of handing out % in your place.
6763 : Kick actually breaks the link with the target % or % and turns it into junk.
6764 : Once kicked, the % will become broken and unusable... Only use this in extreme cases!
6765 : % can also be used to kick but they can only affect %.
6766 : %, %, and % are normal items, so they can be thrown away easily.
6767 : But as normal items, you'll lose them permanently if you throw them away.
6768 : It won't really matter if it's %, but throwing away % is not a good idea!
6769 : Oh, are you sure? Well, if you ever have any questions about % you know where to find me!
6770 : (So anyway, as I was saying...)
6771 : Welcome to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. Do you wish to change your allegiance from your current one to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]?
6772 : Ask about changing your allegiance? Yes. No.
6773 : Then, good journey, [sir/miss].
6774 : You can apply here to change your allegiance to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].
6775 : We will have to seal away some of your memories as an international security measure. Those memories will be unsealed should you change your allegiance back to your former country.
6776 : Incidentally, if this is your first time changing your allegiance, you will have to start over from rank 1 in your new nation.
6777 : Your rank in your former nation is still kept, so if you change your allegiance back you will return to your previous rank.
6778 : In addition, you will retain your current conquest points as well as any records of your expeditionary force quests. Oh, and you will be required to pay a processing fee of # gil along with your application for transfer.
6779 : You will also retain your current rank in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], which is presently rank #.
6780 : In addition, you will retain your current conquest points as well as any records of your expeditionary force quests. Oh, and you will be required to pay a processing fee of # gil along with your application for transfer.
6781 : Do you still wish to change your allegiance?
6782 : Change your allegiance to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]? Yes. No.
6783 : I am obligated to ask you again: Are you sure you want to go through with this?
6784 : Change your allegiance to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]? Yes. No.
6785 : I know it isn't an easy decision to make. Please think it through before you decide.
6786 : Very well. I will accept your application for [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] citizenship.
6787 : I will now cast a spell to seal some of your memories away. Close your eyes...
6788 : May your decision be a wise one...
6789 : You are now a citizen of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]!
6790 : This is where citizens of other nations apply for citizenship in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. Since you are [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian], there is not much I can do for you.
6791 : I cannot accept applications for [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] citizenship while you are on a mission.
6792 : Your home country seems to be in trouble... I cannot accept [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] citizenship applications at this time.
6793 : Well, you must be new here. Welcome to Bastok's renowned Blacksmiths' Guild. We're a union for steelworkers, gunsmiths, armor-workers, and the like.
6794 : What do you mean, you don't want to join? You're missing your chance to be trained by the best!
6795 : So you're looking for a little work to do alongside your adventuring? Well, don't take this job lightly, or you may just get burned!
6796 : Maybe we should start you off with crystal synthesis. You know what a crystal is by now, don't you? Well, those crystals are packed full of power that's just waiting to be unleashed. The process of crystal synthesis utilizes that power for craftwork.
6797 : A crystal receives an image from the user, and uses that image to transform matter. In other words, the more refined the mind, the better the product.
6798 : Did you get all that? I don't expect you to become a master in a few days, so don't feel that there's a need to rush into things, but you know what they say--learn by doing.
6799 : If you want to know more, just ask the smiths here in the guild. They're a little difficult at first, but once you get to know them, they rub off on you.
6800 : The road to becoming a master blacksmith doesn't end in this room. Keep your eyes open for tricks from other trades that might assist you in your journey.
6801 : Go forth and be proud of your blacksmithing ability. But remember that your journey does not end here. A true professional is well-versed in many areas. Good luck!
6802 : You say you're ready to move up in the guild? Well, let's see what you can do. Make me %.
6803 : If I like it, I'll teach you some new techniques.
6804 : ... Not bad. Not good, but not bad. From now on your blacksmith title will be [amateur/recruit/initiate/novice/apprentice]. Keep up the good work, rookie.
6805 : Hmm...  I see that you're starting to get the hang of this. From now on, your blacksmith title will be journeyman! I look forward to seeing your next work.
6806 : ... Excellent! I see that you are finally starting to make a name for yourself. From now on, your blacksmith title will be artisan! That's quite some talent you have!
6807 : ... There is nothing more I can teach you. From today on, I am honored to call you an adept, my rival...and my friend!
6808 : ... You've done one heck of a job here! Now that you've become a veteran, I'll have to work harder to see that you don't steal away any of my customers. Ha ha ha!
6809 : Whaddaya think you're lookin' at? Can't ya see I'm busy?
6810 : What more do ya want from me?
6811 : What the hell is this? I can't even buy a beer bottle cap with that amount.
6812 : Alright. Clench your teeth and get ready to feel the power of Wise Owl.
6813 : Ya wanna learn how to make something, huh? Try %. If you don't like it, ya can go back home to your mommy.
6814 : That's it. Even you could do it...unless you're worried 'bout gettin' ya fancy armor all dirty.
6815 : Wh-what do you want? Someday, I'm going to be as strong as a Galka... M-maybe then Wise Owl will stop picking on me...
6816 : I-I just helped you. Puh-puh-please, stop t-talking to me, or the guildmaster will th-th-think that I'm slacking off.
6817 : I'm sorry. I'm going to have to a-ask you for a little bit more. I-I've got a brother and sister to raise, you know.
6818 : Alright, sir. Now close your eyes...
6819 : Um, yeah... You could try making %. Are you ready?
6820 : I th-think that's all. Be careful when gathering your items. Sometimes you'll end up spending more if you try buying all your ma-ma-materials. But d-d-don't let the guys at the guild shop know I t-told you that.
6821 : Phew, it's hot! Me? Oh, my dad owns half this place, and he's making me work here so I can learn about the real world.
6822 : Hey man, don't gimme any more work than I gotta do.
6823 : Hey, you're going to have to do better than that. I've got a date in Windurst this weekend, and my girlfriend isn't cheap.
6824 : Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. I'm already in my second month! Now close your eyes and say ahhhhhh.
6825 : Hold on a second. Let's see if I can remember... Oh yeah. You should try making %. You use...
6826 : ...and that's it! But, with all that adventuring and blacksmithing and whatever, when do you have time to go out and have any fun?
6827 : The metal you forge has begun to shine. I think it's time you took up the challenge of making %.
6828 : If you succeed, I'll grant you the title of craftsman.
6829 : But remember, with that name come responsibilities.
6830 : Wandering about, trying different things is fine, but don't forget what your priorities are!
6831 : ... Very well done. I grant you the title of craftsman. I expect you to work hard to uphold the techniques of our guild.
6832 : And listen... The road to becoming a master blacksmith doesn't end in this room, but don't go around dirtying your mind with too many other crafts. You'll just lose focus on what is really important.
6833 : % is a wonderful new method of smithing that allows you to enchant metals with the mysterious energy of black magic and anima.
6834 : % is a wonderful new method of smithing that allows you to enchant metals with the mysterious energy of white magic and anima.
6835 : Well, if it isn't %...
6836 : I won't deny it, becoming a great smith requires that you dabble in a number of other fields.
6837 : However, it has come to my attention that you've crossed the line of common sense and become a craftsman somewhere else. I thought I told you the only road to mastersmith status was that of focus? Or have you come here today to tell me that you're willing to give up your craftsman status at these other guilds?
6838 : Revoke all other craftsman statuses? That's why I'm here! Wait a minute...
6839 : I knew that you'd come to. And if you hadn't, I would've pounded you with my hammer until you did! Oh, and don't worry about reporting your decision to the other guilds. I'll make the call first thing tomorrow morning!
6840 : Hmm... I'm tempted to whack you over the head with my hammer until you come to your senses, but I guess the decision is yours...
6841 : Sorry, I don't think you're up for that rank of synthesis yet.
6842 : % is a wonderful new method of goldsmithing that allows you to shape softened ingots with a mandrel, making it easier to process more chains with one crystal.
6843 : % is a wonderful new method of goldsmithing that allows you to shape softened ingots on a workshop anvil, making it easier to process more sheets with one crystal.
6844 : Even the finest blade requires a good sharpening from time to time. You may be [a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master] of our ranks, but I see the potential for you to rise further. What say you?
6845 : Sharpen your skills? Certainly! Maybe later...
6846 : Wonderful! I knew you were made of strong steel. Go find Lorena and ask for a copy of %.
6847 : You'll be needing guild points for the transaction. If you've been slacking off in your training, now's the time to get back to the forge.
6848 : I never figured you for one to bend and break from a challenge. Perhaps you'd feel more at home in the Leathercrafters' Guild?
6849 : Go find Lorena and ask for a copy of %.
6850 : Don't tell me. You've read through %, and now you're ready to fire up the forge.
6851 : Very well. Your task will be to hammer out %. First, you'll need to fetch the necessary materials...
6852 : And don't be forgetting to engrave your signature into your work. This will serve as evidence that it truly came from your own forge.
6853 : Forgotten, you say? I've seen initiates more organized than you! You're fortunate I think so highly of your talent. At any rate, % can be made from...
6854 : Look at the shine on this steel! Why, I've a mind to send it to the display case as is. A fitting debut for the newest expert of our guild!
6855 : You made this, you say? Well, how in blazes am I supposed to know that if it doesn't have your signature!?
6856 : Dull minds make for dull blades--you'll never rise to expert status if you can't follow a few simple directions. Get back to the forge, and try to keep your wits about you this time.
6857 : The metal you forge has begun to shine. I think it's time you took up the challenge of making %.
6858 : If you succeed, I'll grant you the title of [artisan/adept/veteran].
6859 : But remember, with that name come responsibilities.
6860 : Wandering about, trying different things is fine, but don't forget what your priorities are!
6861 : Be warned. Dabbling in other disciplines is all well and good, but reach the rank of [artisan/adept/veteran] in another guild and you'll soon find your skills as a blacksmith dulling.
6862 : %! I have it on good authority that you've risen in the ranks at another guild. Have you slag for brains!?
6863 : Certainly there are gains to be made from branching out--I do not deny this. But at the end of the day, the forge must be your one true home.
6864 : There is only one acceptable course of action. You must renounce your [artisan/adept/veteran] rank in these other fields and reaffirm your commitment to the art of blacksmithing.
6865 : Worry not about contacting the other guildmasters. I shall convey to them the news that you've come to your senses. So, what'll it be?
6866 : The utter gall! And here I thought you had some sense in you, %.
6867 : I've a mind to give that thick head of yers a good pounding, but...bah! What do I care? It's your career you're wasting!
6868 : Join the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild? Sign up. That's not why you're here.
6869 : Request...? [Advanced synthesis/Synthesis/Synthesis] image support. Information on synthesis materials. Nothing.
6870 : Image support: # gil. Accept. Decline.
6871 : You are now recognized as [an amateur/a recruit/an initiate/a novice/an apprentice/a journeyman/a craftsman/an artisan/an adept/a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master/a grandmaster/a legend] of the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.

6879 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. I have been appointed by the Guildworkers' Union to manage the trading of manufactured crafts and the exchange of guild points.
6880 : However, to assure product quality, I cannot carry out any business with those who rank lower than novice.
6881 : I see that you currently have a trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild. I'm sorry, but I cannot do any business with you.
6882 : You do have the option to terminate your contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and form one with us.
6883 : After signing a new contract, you will have to wait until the next delivery phase to trade Guildworkers' Union requested items.
6884 : Create a new contract with us? Immediately. Not today.
6885 : Are you certain? I said, Immediately. On second thought...
6886 : You have terminated your trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
6887 : Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.
6888 : If you happen to create a high quality version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.
6889 : Trading us these items will earn you guild points which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.
6890 : The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.
6891 : When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.
6892 : I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.
6893 : If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.
6894 : You have formed a new trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
6895 : The current requested item is %. You have # guild points accumulated.
6896 : Currently, no items are being requested by the guild. You have # guild points accumulated.
6897 : Is there something you need? I'm just passing through. I would like to use my points. What are the current limits? How does the trade system work?
6898 : You have # more days (Vana'diel time) to provide us with the requested item.
6899 : Today (Vana'diel time) is the final day we will accept the requested item.
6900 : You can still receive up to # guild points by trading us the item before the time limit is up.
6901 : You are not eligible to receive guild points at this time.
6902 : Exchange points for... Nothing. A high-quality crystal. Analysis crystals. % (1500). % (#). % (70000). % (100000). % (150000). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). A key item.

This procedure cannot be undone, so please consider your decision carefully.
6922 : Renounce your rank as a [Carpenter/Blacksmith/Goldsmith/Weaver/Tanner/Boneworker/Alchemist/Culinarian]? No, retain. Yes, renounce.
6923 : You have successfully renounced your status as a [craftsman/artisan/adept] of the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
6924 : I think we have covered all of the topics on our agenda today.
6925 : If there are no objections, I would like to call the 136th Conquest Evaluation Assembly to a close.
6926 : Just a moment.
6927 : Prince Trion, is there something you wish to add?
6928 : ... I will not deny that the participation of adventurers has been of great benefit to the conquest, as well as maintained a new level of safety in the outlying regions.
6929 : In addition, the many treaties signed by our nations have successfully paved a path of peace. No longer need our border guards fear attacks from our friends to the south and east.
6930 : However, the beastman forces display no signs of weakening. Those noble guards stationed in faraway lands must deal with this reality constantly...and the burden has begun taking its toll.
6931 : The already large gap between the guards on our borders and the guards in the Outlands expands with each day. If nothing is done, morale shall continue to fall while discontent grows.
6932 : I sense that my kingdom is not alone in these worries.
6933 : Soldier morale...
6934 : Well, well, well! I never thought I'd see such a lack of confidence from a member of the mighty d'Oraguille family!
6935 : Ohohoho! I never thought I'd see such a lack of confidence from Destin's baby boy--Trion, the prince.
6936 : How dare you!?
6937 : I think that is quite enough, Minister.
6938 : I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.
6939 : Doctor Shantotto... I fully understand the concerns of Prince Trion, and believe he has a point.
6940 : In a republic like Bastok, where a large portion of our army is made up of normal citizens, it is easy for morale levels to slide. This is a problem that is constantly being tackled by our officials.
6941 : Really? Well, that's your nation. Windurst doesn't face such problems.
6942 : Our Mithran Mercenaries enjoy being sent to far-off places. It gives them the opportunity to run and jump and hunt and roll around in the mud--whatever those feminine felines like to do in their free time.
6943 : Maybe instead of buffing up your soldiers' muscles all day, you should try training their minds...like we do. And that's my two gil!
6944 : Oh, really? Well, that's your nation. We don't have such problems in the Federation.
6945 : Our Mithran Mercenaries enjoy being sent to faraway places.  It gives them time to take their naps, hunt their mice, and go on their chases.
6946 : Maybe it's to the lack of confidence that you can give thanks for the drastic fall of morale in your pathetic ranks.
6947 : ...
6948 : Yes, but hiring mercenaries can be quite the burden on the Federation's treasury, can it not?
6949 : Yes, but hiring mercenaries can be quite the burden on the Federation's treasury, can it not?
6950 : The more regions under your nation's control, the more mercenaries you must hire. And before you realize it, your vaults will be empty.
6951 : I suspect that the conquest is taking its toll on the Federation.
6952 : Well, we...
6953 : Ohohohoho! In a matter of months, our wishy-worries will be gone, When our Outland regions are patrolled by automatons.
6954 : Operation costs will stay lower than low. And into our vaults the gil shall flow. Ohoho!
6955 : Shantotto!
6956 : If you wish, Windurst can also build some for use by the king and the president. All for a small fee payable in five easy installments.
6957 : Ohohohoho! In a matter of months, our wishy-worries will be gone, when our Outland regions are patrolled by automatons.
6958 : Operation costs will stay lower than low. And into our vaults the gil shall flow. Ohoho!
6959 : While we appreciate the concern from Destin's baby and Karst's pet, I don't think Windurst will be taking any drastic actions yet.
6960 : But if you wish, we could build some Cardians for use by the king and the president. All for a small fee payable in five easy installments. Ohohohohoho!
6961 : That sounds like a lovely plan, Minister Shantotto.
6962 : But wouldn't the use of automatons in the conquest be in violation of the Treaty of Nations...?
6963 : Hmph. And I have heard many a tale of those walking scarecrows turning on their masters...
6964 : Like father, like son, I say. I would not trust a lump of rubbish made by one of you lunatics any more than I would trust one of you lunatics!
6965 : How can one call a soldier that does not obey his leader a soldier? And how can one call a leader who cannot control his soldiers a leader?
6966 : Ooh, somebody's in a bad mood...
6967 : Prince Trion. You certainly did not bring up this issue without having a solution in mind.
6968 : Exactly! You'd better have something interesting to say. Or Ajido and I will pack up our things and be on our way.
6969 : Recently one of our Royal Knights made his return journey from our kingdom's territories to the north--Lord Excenmille.
6970 : Excenmille? The man who, after the Great War, took a handful of soldiers and successfully invaded the Orcish Empire using guerilla tactics?
6971 : Yes. Sword in hand, donning armor stained with the blood of a thousand foes, he returned to his homeland for the first time in twenty years...and was shocked at what he found lurking beyond its gates.
6972 : Foreign merchants of all shapes and sizes peddling their trinkets. Scruffy adventurers shouting out their petty problems as they walked freely among the streets and alleys. Local shopkeeps and Temple Knights laughing as they mingled with the scum washed up from all corners of the continent.
6973 : Excenmille was furious.
6974 : Why would he be furious? The influx of adventurers has revitalized your nation.
6975 : According to Excenmille, twenty-five years ago, a union among the children of Altana was necessary to defeat the armies of darkness.
6976 : However, now that the threat has gone, there is no reason for San d'Oria's citizens to be brushing shoulders with the common folk of other nations. It is this symbiotic relationship that plagues the Kingdom and keeps the once mighty red lion shackled down.
6977 : That seems like quite an anachronous opinion...
6978 : Excenmille's way of thinking may seem out-of-date, but his logic cannot be denied. Ever since the opening of our gates to outsiders, the quality of our knights has fallen dramatically.
6979 : ... I'm tired of hearing stories about some pumpkin-bumpkin knight. Are you going to get to the point, or are we going to be here all night?
6980 : Excenmille offered me with the following suggestion...
6981 : Revive Conflict!
6982 : ...
6983 : ...!?
6984 : C-Conflict!? A series of games based on battle exercises, played by select heroes from each of the nations...
6985 : Due to the extreme level of danger involved, it was banned well before the Great War. You are not suggesting that we reinstate Conflict, are you?
6986 : That is what I propose.
6987 : Conflict... An interesting idea...
6988 : There was once a time when Conflict ignited the spirits of the people of Bastok--players and fans alike.
6989 : However, after numerous accidents, the games were deemed a bad influence on the Republic's image, and were banned by law.
6990 : If Conflict was reinstated, it could re-ignite the flames in the hearts of all Bastokers and renew their faith in the Republican Army. Morale would be restored, and our problems solved.
6991 : Prince Trion, Prince Trion. If that's all that you wanted to say, you didn't have to go beat around the bush all day.
6992 : Windurst welcomes Conflict with open arms! A little feuding fun could do no harm.
6993 : Shantotto!?
6994 : Oh, there's nothing to get all excited about. The forces of Windurst are in good hands. A couple of knutty knights and measly musketeers are no match for Shantotto's superior battle plans.
6995 : The forces of Windurst are in good hands. A couple of knutty knights and measly musketeers are no match for Shantotto's superior battle plans.
6996 : And once we get our fearless loyal adventurers to help, it will be your two nations letting out cries and yelps.
6997 : If San d'Oria and Windurst have agreed to participate, the president is sure to grant his approval.
6998 : And I know our adventurers will be more than happy to take up their swords for the Republic.
6999 : Excellent. I look forward to meeting you all again on the battlefield.
7000 : Well... It is a rare occasion that all three nations agree on an issue.
7001 : Unfortunately, ducal law prevents Jeuno from participating in such matters.
7002 : However, we will assign officials to take part as Heralds and watch over the games.
7003 : I have no objections. Now let us return to our nations and begin with the preparations.
7004 : Then it has been decided. Sir Wolfgang.
7005 : Ahem. Then, if there is nothing further, I call the 136th Conquest Evaluation Assembly to a close.
7006 : Though I'd rather be sitting on the beach, catching some sun, sometimes these stuffy-snuffy meetings can be kind of fun!
7007 : Though I'd rather be sitting on the beach, catching some sun, sometimes these stuffy-snuffy meetings can be kind of fun!
7008 : I could take up my staff and participate in Conflict myself, but my super-duper whammy-slammy spells would be bad for my opponents' health! Ohohohohoho!
7009 : What do you wish to know about? Basic rules. About the Petra. About Sprint. About Scout. About Gate Breach. About area-specific rules. About returning to battle. About special rules. Nothing at the moment.
7010 : Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word ballista means to throw a stone, and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.
7011 : The rules are simple. Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.
7012 : Players from both teams must search for Petras that a Herald has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as Rooks.
7013 : These Rooks can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their Petras into them.
7014 : Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.
7015 : Petras can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the Quarry (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.
7016 : Sometimes a player may find items other than Petras, such as potions. These temporary items can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).
7017 : Players can carry more than one Petra, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them. However, players will lose their Petras if they: (1) Successfully throw them into a rook. (2) Leave the area. (3) Are knocked out.
7018 : But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the Sprint command while in possession of a Petra. And, players can only use the Scout command if they carry one of the stones.
7019 : As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.
7020 : All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the Sprint command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain Petras.
7021 : However, remember that once a player has obtained a Petra, he or she will be unable to use the Sprint command. In its place, though, one may use the Scout command.
7022 : The locations of the Rooks are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.
7023 : Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate Rooks. However, another way is by using the Scout command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest Rook.
7024 : Finally, Scout can only be used when a player is carrying a Petra. Because Sprint cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.
7025 : So, a Petra has been obtained and a Rook located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.
7026 : There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.
7027 : To throw a Petra into a Rook, a player must first wait until the Rook's gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.
7028 : But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve Gate Breach status. Only then will his or her shots count.
7029 : This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.
7030 : Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.
7031 : The following match types are area-specific: All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains
7032 : Best of Three series rules are as follows: Winning a match will earn a nation one match point. The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for come-from-behind victories.
7033 : Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.
7034 : Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.
7035 : When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.
7036 : For more information on temporary items, refer to the special rules.
7037 : After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.
7038 : If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.
7039 : Please note that many of the rules previously considered special have been fully implemented. Also, several new special rules have been added.
7040 : Learn about which special rules? Temporary items. Ballista Points. Scoring restrictions. Gate Breach radius expansion. Resistance to Sleep. Open entries. Minimum level restrictions. Re-entry restrictions. Participant & Rook numbers. Experience Points. Return.
7041 : Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as temporary items for use at any time during the match.
7042 : Players can hold up to ten temporary items, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.
7043 : If players who possess ten temporary items find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.
7044 : Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.
7045 : Finally, the Heralds will collect temporary items when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.
7046 : Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is #.
7047 : While it is taken into consideration, scoring Petras is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.
7048 : Ballista Points can be traded for special vouchers, which may be exchanged for free temporary items at the start of new matches.
7049 : However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match. Speak with a Marshal directly after a match to register your points.
7050 : Players will only be allowed to score up to five Petras at a time. Also, a player's Gate Breach status will be automatically disengaged if a Petra is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.
7051 : All allies within a certain radius will achieve Gate Breach status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.
7052 : Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.
7053 : During the entry period, from #:, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.
7054 : In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced: Level 30 matches: 130
7055 : Level 40 matches: 3140 Level 50 matches: 4150 Level 60 matches: 5160 Unrestricted matches: 61
7056 : Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.
7057 : When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.
7058 : Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.
7059 : Read which chapter on B.P. Ranking? Basic Information. Registering Points. Rewards. Chevron & Title List. None.
7060 : Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.
7061 : Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register [his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.
7062 : After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.
7063 : If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, [he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special chevron as well as a new title.
7064 : There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as two different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty-two jobs.
7065 : Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, [he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.
7066 : Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.
7067 : However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.
7068 : Finally, checking someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.
7069 : View which chevron/title? 1st (overall). 2nd (overall). 3rd (overall). 4th-10th (overall). 1st (warrior). 1st (monk). 1st (white mage). 1st (black mage). 1st (red mage). 1st (thief). 1st (paladin). 1st (dark knight). 1st (beastmaster). 1st (bard). 1st (ranger). 1st (samurai). 1st (ninja). 1st (dragoon). 1st (summoner). 1st (blue mage). 1st (corsair). 1st (puppetmaster). 1st (dancer). 1st (scholar). 1st (geomancer). 1st (rune fencer).

7114 : You hand over the key item: %.
7115 : Is there something you wish to know?
7116 : Arrre you talking to me?
7117 : Speak up, soldier!
7118 : What shall you ask? About the coming Ballista matches. About the Ballista schedule. About Ballista Earrings. About the rules of Ballista. Nothing at the moment.
7119 : The next match will be held shortly. Let me inform you of the details.
7120 : Listen up, and I will give you a briefing on the details!
7121 : The coming matches? I guess I could tell you what I know.
7122 : There are no matches scheduled at this time. Of course, the moment there are, you shall be the first to know.
7123 : I regret to inform you that there are no matches scheduled in the near future! That is all!
7124 : The coming matches? I'm sorry. Currently there are no plans for any in the near future.
7125 : Ah yes, the schedule. Let me read you the set of dates and times.
7126 : Those fat cats up in Jeuno have finally finished worrrking on the fixed schedule. Let me fill you in on what has been decided.
7127 : Remember, soldier, as long as I'm alive, the schedule I am about to tell you is set in stone! Try to find room in your puny head to fit it in!
7128 : I understand this schedule may seem confusing, but it is really quite simple. Perhaps you should try writing the information down?
7129 : Ah yes, I almost forgot to mention that once you have participated in a match, you must wait a short period until you can make your next entry. Take this into consideration when planning which matches you will attend.
7130 : Did you get all that in your pea-sized brain, soldier!? If you can't handle a simple schedule like that one, you're too stupid to participate in Ballista! That is all!
7131 : And! Once you have taken part in a match, you will not be able to immediately participate again. Think about this when choosing which matches to attend! That is all!
7132 : Did you get all that? What? It's too complicated? Well, you can always do what I do and wrrrite it down.
7133 : Oh, and one more thing. Once you've parrrticipated in a match, you must wait a few days before signing up again. Think about that when planning which days to attend.
7134 : Your air... Your attire... An adventurer, I assume. Have you come looking to register for Conflict?
7135 : I truly am sorry, but we are not accepting applications from those who have yet to prove their loyalty to the crown.
7136 : However, do not let that dampen your spirits. I am positive the day will come when I can welcome you to our noble ranks.
7137 : The future of our kingdom is riding on your shoulders.
7138 : Wait a minute, don't tell me... You'rrre one of the Federation's adventurers, right? And you want to sign up for Conflict?
7139 : Hmmm... I don't know... Your rank is awfully low. How am I supposed to trrrust someone who hasn't prrroved themselves to the nation?
7140 : Get out there and do some missions, and I'll guarantee you a spot on our team. You look like you've got what it takes!
7141 : What!? You think you're [man/woman] enough to join our nation's Conflict forces!?
7142 : Why, you're still a worthless maggot that hasn't done squat for the Republic! Come back when your rank is at least higher than your IQ!
7143 : I'll be watching you, soldier!
7144 : Your air... Your attire... An adventurer, I assume. Have you come looking to register for Conflict?
7145 : Let me introduce myself. I am Excenmille M Aurchiat, acting Conflict Commander of the San d'Orian forces.
7146 : I have heard good things about you, %. Your loyalty to the crown is well-renowned throughout the Kingdom.
7147 : I believe that you would make a fine addition to our ranks, and I welcome you.
7148 : You have come to register for Conflict, have you not?
7149 : Well, before you make a hasty decision, let me explain the finer details of what has transpired in recent months.
7150 : It all began at the last Conquest Evaluation Assembly held in conjunction with the International Commerce Convention. His Majesty, Prince Trion, made the following proposal...
7151 : Do you understand? I was whom the prince was speaking of. And it is I who believe that your unmatched loyalty, bravery, and ability are necessary for the Kingdom's victory.
7152 : If you are truly a servant of the crown, you shall not object to raising your sword in the name of the royaulais.
7153 : I see... I realize that you adventurers have other matters that keep you busy. However, do not forget the debt you owe to the Kingdom that provides for you.
7154 : Wait a minute, don't tell me... You'rrre one of the Federation's adventurers, right? And you want to sign up for Conflict?
7155 : Hmmm... Your rank seems high enough... OK! You'rrre in. I could use a veteran like you to whip some of my younger mercenaries into shape.
7156 : My name's Mhabi Molkot. Up until a few days ago, I was Captain of the Terrible Tigresses, the most fearrred group of Mithra Mercenaries in all of Windurst!
7157 : And then all of a sudden, they make me Conflict Commander...
7158 : Anyway, I said you'rrre in, so you'rrre in already! What? Don't tell me you're having second thoughts!
7159 : Let me tell you a little about what's been going on in the past few months. It all starrrted at some stuffy conference to talk about the conquest...
7160 : And there you have it. The bigwigs up in the ministries probably hearrrd that I was a professional Conflict player back in my homeland, and entrrrusted me with the reins of this runaway horse.
7161 : Maybe it's my instincts talking, but you look like the type who's dying for a chance at the hunt. What do you say?
7162 : [Hmph. Well, you've got guts. You're the first man who's ever turned this cat down./You're turrrning me down?] But I know you'll be back. I can see it in your eyes...
7163 : What!? You think you're [man/woman] enough to join our nation's Conflict forces!?
7164 : You think that just because you have a few missions under your belt that you're ready to play with the big boys!?
7165 : Well, soldier, I've scraped bigger things than you off the bottom of my boot!
7166 : Listen up! My name is Invincible Shield, Legatus of the third division of the Republican Legion.
7167 : The president himself has made me Conflict Commander and put the Bastokan forces under my control. If you join, you will serve under me and under me only!
7168 : What!? You have questions about Conflict!? I don't remember anyone giving you permission to ask questions, soldier!
7169 : I will let it slide this time, but it better not happen again! Now, listen up!
7170 : Did you understand what I just told you!? It is an honor and a privilege to participate in Conflict!
7171 : You want to be a hero!? Well, here's your chance, soldier! Sign this application form and you can be on your way!
7172 : More time!? And I thought you were more than just a whining sissy! The Republic doesn't need any more wimps like you! You are dismissed!
7173 : So, you have finally realized your debt to the Kingdom and decided to repay that debt through service in Conflict?
7174 : Well, look who's back. I knew you couldn't rrresist the excitement of Conflict. You're ready to sign up, right?
7175 : I see that you have finally come to your senses, soldier! Now sign this application and you can be on your way!
7176 : Excellent. However, there is one last task I must ask you to perform before approving your application.
7177 : Travel to Bastok and Windurst and meet with their leaders. You need not worry with the details. They already know you will be coming.
7178 : I also wish you to deliver these letters to the two nations' Conflict Commanders.
7179 : A lofty Galka, Ginu...Invincible Shield, will be waiting for you in Bastok.
7180 : And I recall the Commander of Windurst's forces was a Mithra named Mhabi...something-or-other. I have such trouble remembering foreign names.
7181 : That is all. You may set off immediately. I must say, I am quite honored to send such a fine adventurer as yourself to represent the Kingdom.
7182 : Wonderful! I know you'rrre ready to get out there and starrrt fighting right away, but before you do, you'rrre going to need a license.
7183 : To get a license, you'll need to meet the leaders of the other two nations.
7184 : And--you thought that was it?--you'll need to take these letters to the Conflict Commanders of San d'Oria and Bastok.
7185 : I don't know much about the two, but the Commander of Bastok is some thousand-year-old gut-busterrr named Invincible Shield. I think I rememberrr the one from San d'Oria being some cold-blooded Elvaan named Excenmille.
7186 : Now get going! The faster you get this done, the quicker you can be exchanging blows with those boneheads from the other nations!
7187 : Heh heh heh... When they see who I've sent to them, they'll be shaking in their greaves!
7188 : You've made the right choice, soldier! From this day on, you are an official member of the Bastokan Conflict forces!
7189 : Now listen up, because I'm about to give you your first orders, and I'm only going to say them once! You are to infiltrate the enemies' cities and meet with their leaders!
7190 : What!? Who are the enemy? Where have you been the last twenty-five years, living in a hole!? The enemy are the Elvaan and the Tarutaru!
7191 : After meeting with their leaders, you are to deliver these correspondences to the Conflict Commanders of those nations! Don't worry, you'll have no trouble finding those half-rate cowards!
7192 : Look for Excenmille in San d'Oria and Mhabi in Windurst! Just the sound of their names makes me want to puke!
7193 : You have your orders, now make your final preparations and be on your way! You have ten, no, eight minutes! Dismissed!!!
7194 : Is something the matter? You are to meet the leaders of Bastok and Windurst.
7195 : Also, give the letters I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Invincible Shield and Mhabi...something-or-other.
7196 : What's wrong? Hurry up and meet the leaders of Bastok and San d'Oria.
7197 : Oh, and don't forrrget to give my letters to Invincible Shield and Excenmille.
7198 : Don't even tell me that you forgot your orders! I've met tunnel worms with better memories than you!
7199 : Now listen up, soldier! After meeting with the leaders of San d'Oria and Windurst, you are to deliver the correspondences I handed you to the Conflict Commanders Excenmille and Mhabi Molkot! And I don't want to see your pathetic face until you've completed your mission! Dismissed!!!
7200 : Welcome back from your journey. ......A ha ha ha! So old Ginuva was not pleased with the content of my letter. I can just imagine how he must have looked after reading it.
7201 : Well done, %. Now, all that remains is for you to pledge your loyalty before the royaulais. Proceed immediately to the chateau. We would not want to keep His Highness waiting.
7202 : Welcome back! I was beginning to worrrry that you got lost! ...Heh heh heh! Those two buffoons were rubbed the wrong way by my letters? Hah hah! Thanks, %. You've just made my day.
7203 : Now, all that's left is for you to talk to little Kupipi over there and have her take you to the Star Sibyl. When you'rrre done, you can tell me more about your trip.
7204 : Well done, soldier! I can tell by the look on your face that those two sissies in Windurst and San d'Oria weren't pleased with the letters I had you deliver. Well, that's too bad!
7205 : If a leader cannot stay calm in a tense situation, he'll pay for it with his men's lives! Don't you forget that, soldier!
7206 : Now make your way to the President's Office! Without our leader's permission, you are nothing more than a mangy dog in a uniform! Get moving!
7207 : I commend you, %. You have done well in completing the tasks I set before you. You shall make a fine soldier. Now let me present you with your %.
7208 : This license allows you participation in the traditional San d'Orian battle exercise known as Ballista.
7209 : As this sport has its origins in our kingdom, anything less than victory shall not be accepted.
7210 : Ah, I almost forgot. Currently, the reinstatement of Conflict is only temporary. Much has changed since it was first followed many years ago.
7211 : Because of this, there is a great chance that many of the existing rules may be changed, and the whole system outlawed for good. If you have any opinions on the games, I suggest you are vocal with them. That is all.
7212 : OK! You'rrre done. Here's your %!
7213 : With this license, you'll be able to parrrticipate in one of San d'Oria's old Conflict events--Ballista. I would have preferrrred something more exciting--more Mithran--but I guess this will have to do for now.
7214 : And no matter the game, the best will always win, so we have nothing to worry about! Right, %?
7215 : Oh yeah, I almost forgot... Conflict's rrreinstatement still isn't one hundred percent official. I don't know what those politicians are worrrried about, but I guess that's why I'm not a politician.
7216 : They did say something about changing the rules if the players werrre not satisfied with the current ones. So remember to speak up if you want your voice hearrrd!
7217 : Well done, soldier! I expect the best, and I give the best! Take this %!
7218 : The Ballista License authorizes your participation in the San d'Orian battle exercise known by the same name.
7219 : We must meet the enemy with our blood, our valor, our very lives, to prove to the world that the forces of the Republic are undefeatable!
7220 : In addition, you are not to forget that the rules of Conflict are subject to change without notice!
7221 : While I don't think it is a good idea, the IRNC has decided to listen to the opinions of you adventurers in order to improve Ballista. I say, if you can't take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen! Dismissed!!!
7222 : I happen to be carrying with me a revised edition of the Ballista rulebook. Listen carefully...
7223 : All right, soldier, listen up! Repeat after me the following rules!
7224 : Though I'm not one to really follow the rules, I guess it's good that one of us knows them...
7225 : An exquisite display of force, %!
7226 : It was as if I were watching a battle fought by the Dragon King himself!
7227 : Great job out there, %!
7228 : The dodging and slicing and dashing and slicing. I couldn't have done better myself!
7229 : Excellent work, soldier! The president was pleased to hear of our victory! But do not think that the enemy will take their defeat lightly. They will be back, and they will win unless you stop them!
7230 : Now get back out there, soldier! Do you want to live forever!?
7231 : Unthinkable... A loss to those wretched Tarutaru and their pet kittens.
7232 : If our forces cannot even defeat those cowards, then there is no future for our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, %!
7233 : I cannot believe what I am hearing... A loss to those uneducated Humes and their brainless Galka pets...
7234 : Another defeat at the hands of those materialistic fiends will surely spell disaster for the future of our kingdom. I expect more from you in the next match, %!
7235 : You lost to those arrogant ignoramuses!? How could you lose to those arrogant...
7236 : Ahem! Don't let it happen again, %! You'rrre making me look bad!
7237 : Hissssss! You couldn't even beat Bastok? You couldn't even beat...
7238 : Ahem! Don't let it happen again, %, or I'll scrrratch one of your eyes out!
7239 : Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle! What separates the true victors from the losers lies in how the defeated handle their loss!
7240 : Why did you fail!? What did you do wrong!? And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!? Do not make me repeat these words, %! Dismissed!!!
7241 : Defeat is an unavoidable aspect of battle! You suffered the pain of failure because you were outmatched! But remember, soldier, pain is only in your mind!
7242 : Why did you fail!? What did you do wrong!? And how are you going to make sure these things don't happen in the next battle!? Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win! Dismissed!!!
7243 : I must have underestimated the skill of our rival nation's forces...
7244 : Ha ha! We must consider ourselves lucky to have found such a worthy opponent. However, next time I can assure you San d'Oria will have the upper hand!
7245 : A draw! A draw is worse than being defeated, soldier! It means both forces didn't have what it takes to be a winner!
7246 : You're lucky Ballista is just an exercise, because if this were the real thing, you'd be lying dead in the mud! Now get back out there and don't let this happen again! Dismissed!
7247 : So close, yet so farrr...
7248 : Tell me we're closer than farrrer, right?
7249 : You wish to know about the %? Yes, this device can be of great assistance on the battlefield.
7250 : While wearing it, you will be able to hear the orders of our nation's Pursuivant. His advice should aid you in battle.
7251 : You will also have the opportunity to obtain details of upcoming matches while visiting any of the four nations.
7252 : You want to see this %? Here, take a look. These things arrre pretty useful. I often worrre one back when I was a pro.
7253 : When you have it on, you'll be able to hearrr orders from Windurst's Pursuivant. He'll tell you what to do when you'rrre in a pinch.
7254 : He'll also give you important info on upcoming matches when you'rrre in any of the four nations.
7255 : Listen up, soldier! % will not guarantee you victory, but it can make the difference in a close battle!
7256 : In the heat of combat, soldiers can become disoriented! This earring will relay commands from Bastok's Pursuivant to you. You listen to him, you'll live! You don't, you won't!
7257 : And if you're lucky, he just may give you valuable data on the upcoming matches while your back in the barracks!
7258 : Ask for an earring? Yes. No.
7259 : A wise decision, %. May the words of the Pursuivant guide you and our kingdom to victory.
7260 : Here, let me put it on for you. Hmmm... You look great! Now there's nothing that can stop Windurst!
7261 : Smart move, soldier! Now if you fall in battle, you will have no one to blame but yourself!
7262 : I see. Well, I cannot force you to wear one.
7263 : Well, if you think that you don't need one...
7264 : If you think you've got what it takes to win without an earring, then I won't force you to wear one! However, don't come crying to me if you want one later!
7265 : What is this? Perhaps you no longer require the assistance of the %?
7266 : How's the % worrrking? Or maybe you don't need it anymore. I could always take it off your hands.
7267 : Is there something wrong with your %!?
7268 : Return the earring? Yes. Not yet.
7269 : Ah, so you are ready to stand on your own two feet. I wish all the best in your further matches.
7270 : Really? But it looked so good on you... Oh well, if you ever need another, you know where I am.
7271 : Well, it's about time! I was beginning to wonder when you'd let go of mommy's hand and start to walk on your own! Dismissed!!!
7272 : What is this? I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Federation. Why don't you return to your petty nation and frolic with your feline friends?
7273 : ??? If you haven't noticed, this is not San d'Oria. If you want to sign up for Conflict, I suggest you head back to Ronfaure.
7274 : Does this look like Windurst, maggot!? If you do not leave these premises in ten seconds, I will be inclined to use force! Move! Move! Move!
7275 : What is this? I have no interest in chatting with a lowly member of the Republic. If you do not leave immediately, I'll be forced to call the Temple Knights and have you arrested for impiety to the crown!
7276 : Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? Well, you can keep talking, but don't think I'll be listening. I don't have any business with a Bastoker.
7277 : What is that smell!? Why, it's a San d'Orian adventurer! If you have the time to waste talking to me, you should be out thinking of a way to overthrow that crazy family that is denying your country its freedoms!
7278 : Ah, I see that you were successful in receiving your license... I look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.
7279 : Well, well, well! They even gave you a license. Your country must be really desperate...
7280 : Where did you find that license, soldier!? It is against IRNC law to be in possession another soldier's documentation! What!? That is your license!? Ha! Ha! Ha!
7281 : Ah, so you are applying to participate in the Conflict?
7282 : You may proceed to the chateau and meet with King Destin. The royaulais is in his chambers. However, if I hear of any tomfoolery, I will personally behead you and present your skull to the Heralds for use in Ballista.
7283 : Wait, don't tell me... You'rrre applying for participation in Conflict!? (Hah! A few more players like this and Windurst is guarrranteed victory!)
7284 : Oh, I'm sorry, did you hearrr that? Well, never mind. You see that cute Tarutaru, Kupipi, over there? You just talk to her and she'll take you to the Star Sibyl.
7285 : So this is the type of garbage the other two nations are enlisting!? It makes me sick to see San d'Oria and Windurst not take these exercises seriously!
7286 : I wouldn't think that the president would give scum like you approval to participate in the Conflict, but your appointment has already been made. Now move it!
7287 : What is that? A letter from that rat, Ginuva? Hand it over!
7288 : ......... How dare he even think of mentioning the Second Battle of Konschtat!
7289 : You! Tell your commander that I accept his challenge, and that this time history shall not repeat itself!
7290 : A letter from Bastok? Here, let me see that...
7291 : ......... Grrrrrr! The nerrrve of that Galka... Did he think that after sending such a letter, I'd send you back to your nation in anything less than a body bag!?
7292 : Hm? You had no idea of what was in the letter? Well, then you take this message back to your precious Broken Shield--tell that old bloke that I'll show him the quickest path to rrreincarnation!
7293 : What is this!? A letter from that punk, Excenmille!?
7294 : ......... If he thinks that I...
7295 : You! You tell that good-for-nothing commander of yours that youth won't protect him from the back of my axe! Now get out of my face!!!
7296 : A letter from a Federation Mercenary Captain? Hand it over!
7297 : ......... I am useless and I should have stayed in the Northlands to rot... Preposterous!
7298 : You! Tell your mercenary commander that I accept her petty challenge! Her pathetic claws will not even dent my armor!
7299 : A letter from Lord Excenmille? And it's not even my birthday!
7300 : ......... Grrrrrr! What does he mean, amateurrr!? Ballista's a game, and I was the best! Battle experrrience has nothing to do with anything!
7301 : You! You tell that pompous pighead that twenty yearrrs of playing in the snow with the Orcs won't help him in Conflict! My merrrcenaries will be all over him in a second!
7302 : What is that you have there, maggot!? A shopping list from your mommy!?
7303 : ......... Th...vixen...sh...I...ki...
7304 : You! You tell that worthless commander of yours that she can scream and she can cry, but I will show her no mercy on the battlefield! Now get out of my face!!!
7305 : Excellent show, %! I have just received word that [you were awarded a chevron of excellence/you were the high scorer in San d'Oria's last match].
7306 : I knew from the moment that I laid eyes on you that you would not let the Kingdom down; I just did not expect that it would be so soon. I salute you!
7307 : I just received the news, %! It seems like you did an outstanding job at tearing up the battlefield during the last Ballista match.
7308 : I applaud you on your skill! Maybe it's time I challenged you to a little one-on-one...
7309 : Well, if it isn't the pond scum I found floating on my toilet this morning... What is this? You mean to tell me that you [were awarded some fancy chevron!?/were the top scorer at the last Ballista match!?] I... I...
7310 : What are you looking at, soldier!? Haven't you seen anyone with dust in their eye!? Just because by some fluke you had a fine day on the Ballista field doesn't mean squat! Now get back out there, %!
7311 : Welcome to the Bastokan Institute for Synergistic Research. I am Hildolf, chairman and lead researcher.
7312 : And you... You must be another young [man/woman] drawn here by the pungent but oh-so-sweet smell of science. An aspiring synergist! Am I right?
7313 : Learn about synergy? Not now. Of course!
7314 : Excellent! Your intellectual curiosity will serve you well as you embark on the path of science. Ours is a young discipline, with its greatest discoveries and breakthroughs yet to come, but I shall share with you the fruits of our research thus far.
7315 : I see. I suppose the path of science is not for everyone. Should you ever find your curiosity piqued, the doors of our laboratory are always open.
7316 : Let us start from square one. What is synergy? Why, synergy is synthesis taken to the nth degree! Synergists wield the powers of multiple elements, bringing them together in perfect balance to realize heretofore unimagined possibilities!
7317 : And this is what makes synergy possible: the synergy furnace! Isn't she a beauty?
7318 : Just pop open the top, toss in your materials along with your fewell--that's what we call the stuff that powers the thing--spin some wheels and pull some levers, and...voila! Prepare to be amazed by what comes out!
7319 : ...In theory, at least. Our research is still in the early stages, and the recipes that we've managed to confirm are, as yet, few and far between.
7320 : There are other complicating factors as well. Ingenious invention though it may be, the synergy furnace is yet but a prototype, and remains--how shall I say it--a bit unstable.
7321 : As such, it is imperative that the operator exercise utmost caution to maintain the proper elemental balance at all times. In other words, fewell must be added in proper proportions, but with the contents of the furnace in a constant state of flux, this is no small task.
7322 : Failure to maintain equilibrium may result in explosions, implosions, spontaneous combustions, or other unexpected and unpleasant results. Make no mistake: synergy is not a science for the faint of heart.
7323 : Fortunately, there is good news. The synergy furnace, you see, is designed to allow for manipulation by multiple operators at once.
7324 : Combine your knowledge and skill with that of your colleagues, master the process of maintaining equilibrium, and there is simply no limit to the wonders you may materialize. Truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts!
7325 : So what do you say? Think you're ready to give the synergy furnace a spin for yourself?
7326 : Become a synergist? Maybe another time. Sign me up!
7327 : Oh, it's you again. Don't tell me--your curiosity has gotten the better of you, hasn't it?
7328 : Wonderful! Another test subj--er, budding synergist! First, we'll be needing to set you up with %.
7329 : A what, you say? Put simply, it's a receptacle to hold your materials and fewell, designed to be used in conjunction with the communal synergy furnaces stationed about town.
7330 : I would be happy to put one together for you, provided you furnish me with the components necessary for its construction. Let me see here...
7331 : %, %...%, and... Yes, yes...%. That should be all we need.
7332 : The % and the % can be acquired in abundance from the worms that inhabit Gustaberg. For the %, an expedition to the Palborough Mines might be in order.
7333 : If you're acquainted with a good goldsmith, the % shouldn't be a problem. If not, there's always the auction house.
7334 : All you need to do is trade these components to me, and prepare to enter the exciting world of synergy!
7335 : What? You've forgotten which materials you need? Tsk tsk. Ah well, you wouldn't be the first absent-minded synergist. Now listen carefully this time...
7336 : Stupendous! Can hardly wait to kick-start your career as a synergist, I see. Well, who am I to keep you waiting any longer?
7337 : And there you have it! Your very own %, designed to be compatible with any synergy furnace. And as an added bonus to commemorate the birth of a new synergist, your first fill-up of fewell is on the house!
7338 : My only regret is that I haven't the time to personally educate a promising young synergist like you on all the intricacies of our field. You should seek out the synergy engineers stationed throughout town. They're always eager to share their knowledge with new colleagues.
7339 : Ah, yes. After you've honed your skills a bit, you should stop by the Alchemists' Guild. I haven't had the time to look into it myself, but word has it that their new invention has the synergistic community abuzz.
7340 : Now, if you'll forgive me, my research calls. May your career in synergy be a fruitful one!
7341 : Would that I had the time to discuss my latest discoveries with a fellow synergist! Sadly, I cannot afford even a second away from my experiments...
7343 : Well, well...if it isn't my prize pupil! That sparkle in your eyes tells me that you are well on your way down the path toward scientific enlightenment.
7344 : Should you ever find your fewell stores running low, remember that it is a painless enough process to synthesize yourself some more. You need only prepare the corresponding crystal and rock, together with % and %.
7345 : ...The catch being that the procedure demands a certain degree of alchemical aptitude.
7346 : If you are in immediate need of fewell, I could provide you with a supply from my stock.
7347 : Don't mention it, friend! After all, cooperation among synergists will only serve to further the advancement of our fair science.
7348 : Obtain fewell? %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Perhaps another time.
7349 : You require more time to ponder your decision, yes? A common plight of the prudent synergist, as I know all too well.
7350 : It is % you seek, yes?
7351 : Accept fewell? Yes. No.
7352 : It is my pleasure to provide you with # %. May [it/they] serve you well!
7353 : Greetings, and welcome to the Bastokan Institute for Synergistic Research! I am Hildolf, chairman and lead researcher.
7354 : While I would like nothing more than to expound on the wonders of synergy, I fear my experiments demand my undivided attention. I would encourage you to speak with one of our engineers stationed throughout town should you wish to learn more about our science.
7355 : Ah, always a pleasure to encounter a fellow synergist! I see you've been keeping your % in fine fettle.
7356 : Do you perchance find your fewell tanks running low after synergizing up a storm?
7357 : In my capacity as a pedagogue of the synergistic arts, it is my firm belief that my pupils learn best from solving their problems by their own devices.
7358 : That said, I would sooner see you in front of a furnace than fretting endlessly over a depleted fewell supply. Hence my offer.
7359 : Bring to me % and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire. What say you to my offer?
7360 : What say you? By all means! Not today.
7361 : So your fewell stock is sufficiently full? All the better, then.
7362 : Then, if you will excuse me, I must return to my research. May your synergistic pursuits lead you to knowledge and enlightenment!
7363 : Welcome back, my pupil. Do you find yourself in need of fewell today?
7364 : Very well. Bring to me % and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire.
7365 : Bring to me % and I will gladly synthesize whichever variety of fewell you desire.
7366 : Yes, this is certainly %. There can be no mistaking it.
7367 : As promised, I shall synthesize for you the fewell you desire. What shall it be?
7368 : Very well! Now step back and gaze upon Professor Hildolf's Synthesis 101. This will be on the test, so you may want to take notes.
7369 : Hildolf synthesized # %!
7370 : Now that's some smooth synthesizing, if I do say so myself! And since my laboratory is already overflowing with fewell, why don't you take it all?
7371 : Hm? Running low on fewell again, you say?
7372 : I sympathize, but as my research affords me no time to help you today. Remember, the true synergist is ever resourceful. I leave you to your own devices.
7373 : Of course I'm Cid. Who's asking? You certainly don't look like one of the adventurers I sent out on a mission...
7374 : Oh? A memo for me?
7375 : You hand over the %.
7376 : It's from...Midras. Of course, Junior!
7377 : Let me get a look at that.
7378 : What's that fool prattling on about now? Always a bit big for his britches.
7379 : Hey, Raibaht! Bring me some of that 28-4.
7380 : Idiot. Lucky for him we have the waypoints now, or he'd be completely up the creek.
7381 : It was explosive powder you needed, yes? Sorry that my son made you come do his dirty work for him.
7382 : Speaking of which, if he sent you here that means you came all the way from Adoulin.
7383 : At least you didn't have to travel by boat. Those waypoints are innovation I can get behind. It's almost fearsome how much more advanced Adoulin is.
7384 : <Sigh> I've got a lot left to learn.
7385 : Raibaht, I've told you a thousand times--if you brought the thing, don't just stand there, say something!
7386 : You never change, do you? <Sigh> Anyway, back to Junior.
7387 : Here. This is what he's looking for.
7388 : Oh, before I forget--how is the boy, anyway? He say anything?
7389 : Chief, if you are concerned for the boy's well-being, you should just say so.
7390 : Quiet, you! Stop butting in and get back to work!
7391 : Yes, sir.
7392 : You say he's keeping himself busy helping Amchuchu with her crop research, eh?
7393 : That's good to hear! Energy and persistence conquer all things.
7394 : Huh? Do I have any message for him?
7395 : Hmm...he seems to be doing well enough for himself. Words of encouragement from his old man would probably just embarrass him.
7396 : Come to think of it, if you run across Amchuchu, tell her thanks for looking after my boy.
7397 : Well, don't let me keep you any longer. Junior's waiting.
7398 : Cid, please, calm down.
7399 : Who is it now!?
7400 : %! I'm in no mood for lollygagging, so out with it!
7401 : A letter from Amchuchu?
7402 : I don't even have to open the damn thing to know what it's about. I've heard all about my good-for-nothing son!
7403 : He's dead to me now!
7404 : I've expelled him from my tutelage!
7405 : Tell your precious Amchuchu that there's no need to look after that fool any longer.
7406 : Chew on that!
7407 : Now get the hell outta here!
7408 : Before you arrived, someone from the Tenshodo paid us a visit, asking for Cid. He's been like that ever since.
7409 : I don't know all the details, but I'll hang on to that letter just in case.
7410 : You hand over the %.
7411 : Let's talk outside.
7412 : Hmmm... What made Midras want to become an engineer?
7413 : The only person who can answer that properly is Midras himself. Ah, but wait.
7414 : I remember now. Back when he was still a boy, no older than ten. He got in a fight with one of the other children.
7415 : The other child had a father who was seriously injured in the mining accident, and he took it all out on Midras. If it weren't for your father's rotten powder, that explosion never would have happened! or something like that.
7416 : Midras was dumbfounded, and came to me for the truth. Sadly, it's not easy to lie to a child.
7417 : He didn't say anything after that, but now that I think of it, that might have been the day.
7418 : Ever since then, he would always be reading the explosives manual Cid gave him and would sometimes come to me with questions on mixtures and component ratios.
7419 : That's about all I can remember, though. Hard to say if that's really what made him take up the hammer.
7420 : What? You want to know where the accident happened?
7421 : Listen, it's been over twenty years now. I don't go there anymore--none of us do, but I won't stop you if you're serious.
7422 : It was in Palborough Mines. Take the elevator up to the third floor. The explosion happened down the unfinished shaft around G-8. I'll never forget that shaft.
7423 : It's been ages, though. I wouldn't get your hopes up of finding anything down there.
7424 : The accident happened in Palborough Mines. Take the elevator up to the third floor and head to the unfinished shaft around G-8.
7425 : You're back. Not so loud.
7426 : Hrmmm... You know who knows the right explosive mixtures for the bedrock in Palborough better than anyone?
7427 : That's right. Midras.
7428 : I don't know if he'd be willing to help, but he's the one you need to talk to.
7429 : That kid would always be hanging around the port docks when something was on his mind. If they have docks over in Adoulin, I'm guessing that's where he'd be.
7430 : I've got to get back to work now.
7431 : Talk to Midras. He'll know which explosives you need.
7432 : Wh-what!? You say you...saw them?
7433 : You hand over the % and %.
7434 : This...
7435 : This was Sirius's ring.
7436 : Sirius...founder of the Steaming Sheep, husband to Hilda...and a good friend.
7437 : And this... This is Almid's locket.
7438 : Almid, father of Midras. His real father.
7439 : Gah...Gahahahaha!!!
7440 : Pathetic! And here I was all this time feeling useless, while they were waiting for me the whole time in there!
7441 : If only I could have done something...anything. At the time of the accident, we all felt that way, but there was nothing to be done but clear the rubble and bury the bodies.
7442 : Hey, Raibaht! Come in here and give me a hand!
7443 : At times like this, you're better off laughing!
7444 : Yeesh! What's with that racket? If you don't quit that, I might just start calling you Loud Mountain or something!
7445 : Of course, Chief. You may call me whatever you wish!
7446 : Hey, listen. Don't tell Cid about any of this. It's better if he doesn't know.
7447 : Hurry and take that locket to Midras. He should have it.
7448 : Hopefully it will help him understand his real father.
7449 : I will take the ring to Hilda. It's hers now.
7450 : Hey, Raibaht! You got ears on your head!?
7451 : Yes, Chief. I have ears.
7452 : Well, then. I think I'll finish early today and go out for a big plate...of %.
7453 : Obtained key item: %.
7454 : What can I do for you?
7455 : This is Bastok's Blacksmiths' Guild. Ours is the real thing--the one in San d'Oria doesn't have half the things we do!
7456 : This is the Gunpowder Room. Everything in here is the product of the chief's hard work.
7457 : The Gunpowder Room was supposed to become a guild, too, but the accident changed everything...
7458 : Do we look like we have time to chitchat with every adventurer who comes in here?
7459 : Good luck on your mission. Bastokers like to do things by the book, so stay out of trouble and follow their rules.
7460 : You've successfully completed your mission. Congratulations, and keep up the good work.
7461 : Present your letter of introduction if you have business with the consulate. If you do not have one, please leave the premises.
7462 : You have a letter of introduction? Good. Please go speak with the consul.
7463 : Good luck. I pray for the successful denouement of your mission.
7464 : There must be many missions that still need completing in San d'Oria. I pray for your success on them as well.
7465 : Bastokers have no sense of style! I don't understand how anyone could live in such a dreary place. Oh, I so wish I was back in San d'Oria!
7466 : Oh, you have a letter of introduction. Then go back there and talk to the consul.
7467 : They gave you a job to do, I hear. Whatever do they need you for in these backwaters, I wonder?
7468 : Oh, you're back. I envy you. You're not stuck here like me...you can always go back to San d'Oria.
7469 : Nations without history, like Bastok, lack tradition and elegance. Our fair San d'Oria, on the other hand, is the prime example of orderly style.
7470 : Ah, you have a letter of introduction! Quickly, you must go speak to the consul, in the back.
7471 : Fare thee well, adventurer. It would be a shame to lose one such as you in a place like this, so far from San d'Oria.
7472 : It is good to see you are safe. You should not tarry in a place like this. San d'Oria awaits you, my friend. Go to her while you can!
7473 : Yes, I am the Windurst consul--but it's just a sinecure. No one wanted this position, and I don't blame them.
7474 : Good luck on your mission! People here play by the rules, so you should, too, or there'll be trouble-rubble for us!
7475 : Good work! Oh, and tell the people in Windurst and the other consuls I said hi when you get back.
7476 : Yes, this is the Windurst consulate. Windurst...ah, fair Windurst, how I long for thee-wee...
7477 : A letter of introduction? You are from Windurst! Pray tell, how are things there!?
7478 : Oh, you want missions... Then, please speak with Consul Patt-Pott... Ah, Windurst, how I long for thee-wee...
7479 : You're going where all those monsters are, aren't you? I wish I was back in Windurst...it was so peaceful there.
7480 : You've made it back. Then you are returning to Windurst? Oh, how I envy you...
7481 : Oh, hello! Welcome to the Consulate of Windurst. Ah, but we can't do anything for you if you don't have a letter of introduction...
7482 : Oh! You have a letter of introduction! The consul would want to see you. He's in the back--go right on in.
7483 : Oh, you're going to be fighting and all, aren't you? Be careful!
7484 : Oh! Good to see you again! Are you going back to Windurst now? Tell everyone there we're doing fine!
7485 : Hello...? Yes, this is the Windurst Consulate.
7486 : A letter of introduction...? Go talk to the consul, there.
7487 : Going fighting...? Good luck.
7488 : Your mission's over...? Make it to Windurst safely.
7489 : An adventurer, in the Consulate of Jeuno? You have no business here.
7490 : You are in the Consulate of Jeuno. We cannot do anything for you unless you are a citizen of Jeuno.
7491 : This is the Consulate of Jeuno. There is nothing we can do for you unless you are a Jeunoan.
7492 : This is the Consulate of Jeuno. We can't do anything for you unless you have Jeunoan citizenship.
7493 : I am sorry, but I am a little busy at the moment. Would you mind coming back later?
7494 : This is the Presidential Aide's Office. Sir Lucius is quite busy at the moment--please try not to disturb him.
7495 : Yes, what is it you want with the Department of Industry? We're very busy, you know. But we wouldn't be if the big boss wasn't such an ignorant amateur.
7496 : This is the Department of Industry. Industry is what drives our nation, so our department essentially manages everything in Bastok.
7497 : Good senators like myself take time to listen to the pleas of the masses, unlike our young and inept president.
7498 : Heh-heh-heh. You are very kind, your lordship. You have given us so much... Heh-heh.
7499 : I must raise the Metalworks output before my term here ends. I should start by raising everyone's daily quota...
7500 : These managers they send us are all the same. They make us do all the work, and they take all the credit.
7501 : Did you see the big water wheels upstairs!? They're amazing! They send power to the entire Metalworks, you know?
7502 : Tsk, tsk! Engineers these days rely too much on machines! Why, in my days...
7503 : Ka-chink! Ka-chink! I just love the sound of hammers hitting metal! I think it's even better than the songs that bards play!
7504 : Have you ever met a feisty girl wearing a big scarf? She's the president's daughter, you know. No, I'm not kidding! I also hear they used to get along well until he came to his present post.
7505 : Man, I need a break...
7506 : I'm hungry...no, I mean, I'm starved.
7507 : The food here isn't bad, but a little more variety wouldn't hurt, you know what I mean?
7508 : My friend, Offa, has been telling me that % are exquisite! I wish I could have some, someday.
7509 : He told me that there was an easy but dangerous way of making them, but--hey, speaking of Offa, he hasn't been coming to work lately...
7510 : Hmm, he's probably loafing around in his house in the Markets District again.
7511 : Hey! Is that %? Let me have it! Here, I'll give you this!
7512 : Whether it's mining, smithing, or adventuring, it's all the same. We Galka do all the dirty work while the Humes sit back and watch.
7513 : This is the President's Office.
7514 : Do you not have any missions to complete? If not, go get one and stop bothering me.
7515 : I'm sorry, kid, I'm a little busy right now. Come back later, hear?
7516 : Ah, it's you. You remember what I asked you to do, right?
7517 : Do not bother the chief. Every second he spends away from his research is a loss to the Metalworks.
7518 : This is the President's Office. Don't go in unless you got official business.
7519 : How are you faring, adventurer? Remember, experience is the best teacher.
7520 : These cannons are nothing more than symbols now, and that is the way it should be.
7521 : These doors lead to the President's Office. Only those on special missions and high-ranking Bastokan adventurers may enter.
7522 : This is the Southern Cannonry. We can control all the cannons in Bastok from here. Hopefully, we won't need to any time soon.
7523 : Hey, you're not a kid. Why are you on the stamp hunt? No, don't tell me, I don't want to know. Here.
7524 : You received a stamp!
7525 : This alcove is our Temple of the Goddess. Not many come here--Bastokers are not known for their piety.
7526 : The stamp hunt? I do take exception to having people stomping into this sacred place, but...here, let us be done with it.
7527 : This area is off-limits to...oh, you've brought the report from the Zeruhn Mines. I'll take that.
7528 : This was your first mission, wasn't it? Good work. Normally, we--
7529 : Sir Lucius! How may I help you?
7530 : Naji...you mentioned a report?
7531 : Yes, sir! This adventurer just brought the last one. I was going to bring them all to you later, sir.
7532 : Show it to me.
7533 : So...more and more Galka are starting to believe in their Talekeeper's return.
7534 : The Talekeeper, sir? But I thought that was just some Galka myth, sir.
7535 : If that were only true... I've received reports that the Talekeeper is already back among them.
7536 : These reports...keep bringing them to me, Naji. We would not want to bother the president with such trivial matters.
7537 : Yes, sir!
7538 : As for you, I know you have not been in Bastok long, so I will give you some advice.
7539 : It is neither customary nor polite to open sealed documents prior to their delivery. Remember that if you wish to stay in Bastok.
7540 : As for you, adventurer, you have done well. Bastok needs more people like you.
7541 : Wow! Not many people get to speak to Sir Lucius after their first mission. He must see something in you. Keep up the good work!
7542 : Yeah, what do you want? I'm a little busy right now.
7543 : Hmm? Yeah, I'm Cid. Oh, you're here about the mission! Right, I was expecting you.
7544 : Hey, Raibaht! Bring the thingamajig over here.
7545 : This is only your second mission, huh? Most of the young ones in Bastok don't have the guts to go adventuring, so I'm counting on you. Do your best, hear?
7546 : Well, this mission's not all that tough. You just have to go out...
7547 : ...Raibaht, old buddy, if you brought the thing, don't just stand there, say something!
7548 : ...I brought the thing.
7549 : Gah! If you don't quit that, I'm gonna start calling you Silent Mountain or something!
7550 : You would not, Chief. You are not like the others. That is why I work for you.
7551 : Sheesh... I like the guy--he works hard, he's thorough in his research and all--but if only he was a little more talkative, you know?
7552 : Anyway, here's what I want you to do. Take this % to the Dangruf Wadi near South Gustaberg.
7553 : Try to find a place in the Wadi where this % changes color. That's all.
7554 : What is it for? Well, in order for you to understand, I'd have to give you some lessons on the accrual patterns of sediments in the Wadi and the formation of gas pockets in the soil...
7555 : ...You're getting a blank expression on your face. I know, I know, you didn't become an adventurer to study geology, right? Don't worry, it's nothing dangerous, so get going!
7556 : Ah, you're back! Let's see it. Hmm...red, as I thought. And a very strong reaction, too.
7557 : Then we should be able to use it...but we must make sure to minimize the ecological repercussions of such work...
7558 : Busy as always, Chief?
7559 : Volker, you old dog! When did you get back?
7560 : Just recently, sir. I had business in the Metalworks today, so I thought I'd drop by.
7561 : You must have some great stories to tell! Come on, out with them!
7562 : Chief, were you not speaking to this person before I interrupted?
7563 : Oh, right! Sorry. It's been a long time since he and I had a chance to talk.
7564 : Let me introduce myself. I am Volker, captain of the Mythril Musketeers.
7565 : You must be an adventurer...and new to Bastok too, are you not? I hope you do well. Bastok is in need of good people.
7566 : Yeah, for your second mission, you've done very well. I'll tell the guard at the gatehouse myself.
7567 : Well, I should be going. I will drop by again later, Chief.
7568 : I must go lend an ear to the president's gripes again.
7569 : Come on, he needs support, especially from you. It might not look like it, but I'm sure he's doing his best.
7570 : I'm sorry to have kept you here so long. Thanks again, and good work. Oh, and I might need your help again soon, so stay in touch!
7571 : Ah, you've been assigned to investigate the %?
7572 : There are many strange phenomena associated with that place, as you've heard.
7573 : I've scanned that area and I've found there is a strong crystal resonance on a straight line between that structure and Jeuno.
7574 : For now, I'm calling it the Crystal Line...
7575 : Never mind, you're getting that blank expression on your face again. I'll skip the details.
7576 : There are three places near the structure where you can get %. They're shining, raised platforms called Telepoints.
7577 : Place a crystal on a Telepoint, and the crystal will be drained of its power. Do that, and bring back the faded crystal to me.
7578 : Oh, one more thing. To put the crystal on a Telepoint, use Trade.
7579 : Good, you've brought back %. As I thought, its pattern of deterioration is almost identical to the one found in Beadeaux...
7580 : <Sigh> I just don't know what to make of all the strange occurrences that have been happening lately...
7581 : I wonder if this has anything to do with the shattered Telepoint we discovered recently...
7582 : I wonder if this has anything to do with the shattered Telepoints...
7583 : Hm? Oh, sorry. Just talking to myself. Good job. You can...wait, can I ask you to do something else for me?
7584 : Do you remember Volker? He came here when you were reporting the results of your first mission to me.
7585 : It would be best if you could deliver this to him personally, but he's a busy man and hard to find.
7586 : Give it to one of his Mythril Musketeers instead. Ayame and Naji should be on guard near the President's Office. Either one will do.
7587 : A letter from the Chief? What is it about?
7588 : It's addressed to our captain. Let's see... Hmm? Huh? I can't make heads or tails out of this...
7589 : I'm sorry, but could you give it to Ayame instead? She should be on guard at the rear of this building. This kind of technical stuff's more her specialty. It's all mumbo-jumbo to me.
7590 : Oh, but do me a favor... Don't tell her I asked you to, or she's gonna make fun of me again.
7591 : You have a letter from the Chief Engineer? May I see it?
7592 : This is a report on the investigation of the Crystal Line. It is addressed to our captain... This might mean our company is moving out soon.
7593 : Thank you for bringing this to me. Your presence is very much appreciated. The Chief is a little busy these days to do such chores himself.
7594 : I must ask you one thing, though. Why did you bring this to me, and not Naji? He is also a Mythril Musketeer, and posted closer to the entrance.
7595 : Why did you bring the letter to Ayame? Naji didn't look smart enough. Ayame looked more reliable. Because I felt like it.
7596 : Hah hah hah. Well, he is always saying, I'm a fighter, not a thinker! The latter, I may have to agree with.
7597 : Thank you for the compliment. Mythril Musketeers are supposed to be reliable, but I wasn't sure if I could fit the role. Well, at least I do a little bit more than Naji.
7598 : You're very perceptive; I like that in an adventurer. I guess I'll be seeing you around a lot more.
7599 : Oh. Well, no matter. Good work.
7600 : Oooh! You've brought me %! I just love these cooked--
7601 : Uh...I mean, this is very important to the safety of Bastok, yes! It's imperative that you do not tell anyone you've brought this to me!
7602 : You have proven yourself to be a great patriot! I will be following your career with great interest.
7603 : Senator, sir...you still haven't handed in your orders regarding--
7604 : Iron Eater! Wh-what are you doing here!? I am in the middle of a very important--
7605 : % again, sir?
7606 : How did you know? Uh...I mean, get out! It's going to spoil if I don't cook it--
7607 : <Sigh> Bon appetit, sir. Just hand in the papers to one of the Musketeers as soon as you're done.
7608 : Tell me...do you not sometimes wonder if these missions are truly worth your time?
7609 : Do you think missions are a waste of time? Yes, I do. No, I don't.
7610 : Hah hah hah. You are an honest one. But it is not something you should say to a Mythril Musketeer, especially when you are near the President's Office.
7611 : I see. I must apologize. It is unbecoming of a Mythril Musketeer to ask such questions.
7612 : Either way, there is no question that you have done a great deal for the prosperity of Bastok, and that you will in the future as well.
7613 : I must try to do the same...
7614 : Good to see you again. I hear you're going overseas.
7615 : Usually, I would be giving you your orders, but this time, the president's aide wants to meet with you in person.
7616 : I don't know if the missions you've been on so far were tough for you...
7617 : But this time, I'm sure it's going to be a real challenge.
7618 : I mean, you're going to have to go to both San d'Oria and Windurst...
7619 : It's not like going somewhere nearby, like Gustaberg or the Konschtat Highlands. You'll have to travel by sea, too.
7620 : This is the President's Room. Remember to be polite.
7621 : (Oh, and make sure you don't say anything that might offend him... He's really touchy.)
7622 : Ah, we have been expecting you. I remember meeting you after your first mission. Let me introduce you. This is Sir Karst--
7623 : President Karst. That is how you will address me.
7624 : Lucius, what was that about a first mission?
7625 : The report from the Zeruhn Mines, sir. About the Talekeeper--
7626 : Hmph. Those Galka again. I was not informed you had met with the messenger, Lucius.
7627 : I did not feel it was necessary to bother you with such trivial matters, sir.
7628 : President, Lucius.
7629 : My apologies. I am sorry for not having informed you about the Galka, Mister President.
7630 : No matter. Here are your orders.
7631 : As you know, there are three other nations aside from our own in Vana'diel. The Kingdom of San d'Oria, the Federation of Windurst, and the Grand Duchy of Jeuno.
7632 : Jeuno is still professing neutrality, so I want you to go to San d'Oria and Windurst.
7633 : It does not matter which you go to first, as long as you go to both. I will give you a letter of introduction, which you will present to the consuls in both nations. Any questions?
7634 : Any questions? What do I do once I get there? Why am I being sent? How do I get to San d'Oria? How do I get to Windurst? Where are the consulates? Why did you call me here? No questions.
7635 : The consuls in each country will tell you. Don't worry, we are not asking you to spy--the jobs you will be given will benefit those countries as much as ours.
7636 : Why? Officially, to promote friendship between our nations. In reality, to investigate the internal state of those countries, and also to train you.
7637 : San d'Oria is in Northern Quon, the same continent as Bastok. You can get there by land.
7638 : Go to the port town of Selbina to the northwest. Once there, you can take a ship to Mhaura, a small town that is a stone's throw away from Windurst.
7639 : Ask someone else if you want details. I'm the president, not a travel agent.
7640 : And you call yourself an adventurer!? Just ask the guards of the country you're in!
7641 : I do not trust my subordinates, so I prefer to give the most important orders myself. That is all you need to know.
7642 : Any other questions?
7643 : Good. Lucius, the letter.
7644 : This is your letter of introduction. Present it to the consuls and they will give you further instructions.
7645 : Those are your orders. Depart quickly. You are dismissed.
7646 : So, how did it go? Did the president nag at you?
7647 : I still can't believe that Chief Cid actually backed that guy during the elections...
7648 : Oops. You didn't hear me say that, okay? I gotta go. Good luck on your mission!
7649 : Wow! You've been to San d'Oria and Windurst already? Let me escort you to the President's Office.
7650 : So, how was it? Did the Orcs in Ghelsba or the Yagudo in Giddeus give you any trouble?
7651 : Man, I envy you. I'm a Mythril Musketeer, but all they make me do is stand guard at that door.
7652 : Captain Volker and Iron Eater get all the good missions, and Ayame always puts me down...
7653 : I'm a Mythril Musketeer, the cream of the crop! Why do I have to do guard duty? It's just not fair...
7654 : Then perhaps I should order you to sweep the Quadav from Palborough...single-handedly.
7655 : M-Mister President!
7656 : Go back to your post, Naji. That is an order.
7657 : Report. What have you learned of Windurst and San d'Oria?
7658 : What do you report? The details of your trip. The internal state of San d'Oria. The internal state of Windurst. The state of the Kindred.
7659 : Oh, did you have a pleasant trip, then? Bah! Do you mock me, adventurer? Tell me of the other nations, now!
7660 : Hmph. So they are still trapped in their foolish traditions. They are no better than the Orcs they fight with.
7661 : Hmph. Then it would be foolish to expect any help from those cowards in fighting the beastmen...
7662 : You mean that someone is leading the beastman hordes, then?
7663 : Lucius. Speak with Volker about this, and come back when you have a plan to deal with this situation. And do not forget to watch the Quadav.
7664 : Do you have anything else to report?
7665 : I have spared you all the time I can. Lucius, stay and see what sense you can make of this--and do spare me all the trivial details when you report to me.
7666 : Tell me more of what you have learned about the beastmen, please.
7667 : I see... It does seem like there is someone controlling their movements. But who could be powerful enough to unite those unruly hordes...?
7668 : Good work. We will probably ask you to undertake another important mission in a few days.
7669 : The president, despite his harsh words, values you highly and will expect you to do well. As do I.
7670 : Ah, you're here on a mission, aren't you? We've been expecting you. It's good to see you made it here safely.
7671 : Riault, if you please.
7672 : Yes, ma'am. First, let me tell you about Bastok's current state.
7673 : Bastok has already lost several major assets to the Quadav. The Palborough Mines were the greatest loss.
7674 : Their recent plight is akin to ours in our fight against the Orcs. Only in the time prior to the Great War did the power balance shift so.
7675 : I've heard a rumor that they are rallying behind a new leader! Can you believe it? Beastmen, being organized!?
7676 : This bodes ill, I tell you. What's worse, we are stuck here in this city of uncouth ruffians!
7677 : Chantain! That is enough. Riault, please continue.
7678 : Your mission is to go to the Palborough Mines, currently under Quadav control, and take a sample of the dwindling resource called mythril.
7679 : To be precise, we need you to bring back %.
7680 : Thanks to our agreement to mutual cooperation, Bastok is allowing us to send you into the mines. Your true objective is to gather as much information as possible on Bastok's advanced technology.
7681 : We need to find out who or what is rallying the beastmen, and at the same time make it look like we are cooperating with Bastok.
7682 : That is why we need you to go investigate the Palborough Mines. They were once the property of Bastok...but these days, no sane Bastoker would come within a malm of it, given the choice.
7683 : If it were up to us, we would want you to go to the mines right away, but we were told by the Bastok authorities that you must report to them first in order to receive authorization.
7684 : I know you'd rather do without all the red tape, but bear with us and report to the Bastokan official named Pius. He can be found in the President's Office.
7685 : I must warn you that we thought the Humes were a reasonable people before we came here...but we've found that this is not always the case.
7686 : Their talent at making profit is incomparable, but their sense of duty is somewhat lacking. In fact, even their officials can be troublesome. For the sake of your mission's success, try to be patient.
7687 : Ah, you've brought the %. Good work.
7688 : I will have Riault make a brief of the information we've been able to assemble on Bastokan technology. Riault, if you please.
7689 : Ah, you have returned. What did you find? Hmm...I see. I am glad you made it back safely.
7690 : Riault will write down the details of your investigation. Please tell him what you have seen.
7691 : <Sigh> Oh, when will we be allowed to go back to San d'Oria, I wonder.
7692 : I've had it up to here with these crass Humes and savage Galka. I want out!
7693 : I know what you mean. Even their architectural techniques are crude. It's a wonder these buildings are still standing!
7694 : Might I remind you two that this crude and savage nation is rivaling San d'Oria for power on this continent?
7695 : San d'Oria can ill afford to sit back on its past glories. Our complacence and arrogance will be our downfall.
7696 : Wasn't it that kind of talk that got you sent here in the first place, regardless of the fact that you are of noble blood?
7697 : Yes, you should be careful. As my grandfather used to say, If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.
7698 : Oh, you should talk, Chantain. Riault, isn't it about time you were done?
7699 : All done, ma'am. This concludes the Bastok part of this mission.
7700 : You are going to Windurst next, aren't you? Do as you have done here. Head to the consulate, and they will take care of you.
7701 : Glory be to San d'Oria, and may you walk with honor.
7702 : Your mission is almost complete. You have only to return to San d'Oria with your report.
7703 : Oh, you're the adventurer with the letter of introduction, yes?
7704 : It's good of you to come. It must've been a long journey, riding a boat to a faraway place like this.
7705 : I studied hard to become a consul, hoping I'd be waited on by cutesy-wutesy secretaries, but my fate was to be delegated to this neck of the woods...
7706 : Oh! I'm sorry-worry! Don't tell anyone I said that, please?
7707 : I mean, you can't blame me--I'm surrounded by musky Humes and scary Galka instead of cutesy...uh, you know.
7708 : Oh, Mih Ketto? We have a guest here. Shouldn't you be serving tea?
7709 : What tea? We ran out of tea months ago!
7710 : Then why haven't you refilled our stock? How many times have I told you...
7711 : Uh...sir? Would you like me to go out and buy some?
7712 : Hmm, well... Now that you mention it, I don't remember seeing anyone selling tea here...
7713 : Hmm? You don't care about tea, you say? You want to hear about the mission? Oh, bother...
7714 : I'm sorry, as greasing people's...I mean, trying to make people happy-snappy has become a habit. It's part of the job.
7715 : Anyway, here's what you have to do... Uh... That is... Let's see...
7716 : Topuru-Kuperu! What was it we were supposed to ask?
7717 : Huh? What? Did you call me, sir?
7718 : Oh! There you are! You were making yourself so small I didn't see you!
7719 : The mission, man, the mission! You know, for the adventurer from Windurst!
7720 : I know how homesick you are, but I expect you to do your share while you're here!
7721 : Uh...I think it had...something to do with going to the Palborough Mines, sir...
7722 : Oh...I remember now. We need some refined ore.
7723 : What? Is that really something we should be asking a great adventurer from Windurst to do? And the Palborough Mines are infested with Quadav, too!
7724 : Beg your pardon, sir, but...I think it's our pretext for studying Bastokan technology, sir...
7725 : Oh, I remember now. The Quadav are acting strangely, so the adventurer is to go to the Palborough Mines to investigate.
7726 : That's very-wary vague... And aren't the Palborough Mines overrun by the Quadav? Isn't that dangerous?
7727 : Well, reports from Windurst say that beastmen of different types all seem to be exhibiting the same type of organized behavior... That is what we need to investigate, sir.
7728 : But first, the adventurer is to meet with Sir Pius in the President's Office...
7729 : Ah, yes! Pius--Sir Pius. I think we've had dinner once...or perhaps it was brunch?
7730 : No matter. To work, then! Good luck! Come back when you're done!
7731 : Ah, %! Good job! Good job! Tell Topuru-Kuperu what you've seen.
7732 : We'll return this % to the government of Bastok after we've studied it.
7733 : So you were able to enter a beastman-infested area, perform your mission, and still manage to come back in one piece. Extaruordinary! Don't you think so, Topuru-Kuperu?
7734 : Ah, welcome back! I see you're still in one piece!
7735 : Topuru-Kuperu will write down your report. Tell him what you've seen!
7736 : Oh, my! Is that true!? Oh, my! Oh, my!
7737 : It's simply amazing that you could run into such a monster, and not be pounded into adventurer soup! Don't you think so, Topuru-Kuperu?
7738 : What? Oh, right. I guess so, sir.
7739 : Oh, let me guess--you were thinking about Windurst again, weren't you? Snap out of it, man! You have work to do!
7740 : <Sigh> Windurst...
7741 : Well, you can't say I didn't try. Ah--but you will report that all of us are working exceptionally hard here, yes?
7742 : You're off to San d'Oria now, aren't you? Have a safe and pleasant trip!
7743 : Since you've visited both San d'Oria and Bastok, you may now make your triumphant return to Windurst! Oh, and tell everyone we said hi!
7744 : Yes, what is it? Ah, you are the envoy from [San d'Oria/Windurst].
7745 : Go speak to a Galka named Grohm--he was part of the expedition that tried to reclaim the Palborough Mines from the Quadav once before. He should be in the Craftsmen's Eatery in the Metalworks.
7746 : Why are you still here? The Musketeers are usually charged with giving out missions, and frankly, I find this kind of work tedious...
7747 : But since you are an envoy, you are under my jurisdiction. Still, I can't help but wonder what you [San d'Orians/Windurstians]' true motives are...
7748 : Then again, you're going willingly into that Quadav-ridden place, so I can't complain, even if you do turn out to be a spy.
7749 : Well, anyway... You want to speak to Grohm, in the Metalworks eatery. Good luck to you.
7750 : Oh, and when you're done with your investigation, report directly to your consulate. That is our protocol. I would be rather annoyed if you were to come back here.
7751 : Hm? What do you want? Hey, you're not from Bastok, are you?
7752 : What!? You're [San d'Orian/Windurstian], and you listened to what a Bastokan official told you to do?
7753 : Hah! I have no idea why that Hume sent you here...or why your consulate sent you to him in the first place.
7754 : You better listen good. A lot of us died trying to win the Palborough Mines back from the Quadav...
7755 : It might not matter to a foreigner like you, but they always send us Galka to do the dirty work!
7756 : What gets me the most is that they don't even think about it twice! Even if you haven't been here long, you must've seen how they treat us.
7757 : Never mind. Shouting at you won't change anything. You wanted to know about refining ore, right? It's easy, but you have to remember the steps.
7758 : Here goes: 1. Get %. 2. Put that into the upper part of the refiner. 3. Take the % out of the lower part of the refiner.
7759 : You can either buy % from someone, or get some by using % on a mythril seam inside Palborough.
7760 : The refining machine is so big, its upper and lower sections are on different floors. Put % into it on the third floor, and it'll produce % on the second floor.
7761 : I know it sounds simple, but it's not. You've got the Quadav to deal with, and they're everywhere.
7762 : Here, take these %. Good luck. You're gonna need it.
7763 : Hey, you're an adventurer, right? From another country?
7764 : Sorry, I couldn't help but eavesdrop. I'm going to the Palborough Mines, too.
7765 : Don't worry, I won't get in your way. I don't think we're going after the same thing anyway.
7766 : At least, for now.
7767 : But you shouldn't think your mission is just a mine survey.
7768 : The beastmen seem to have found a new leader, and the Quadav are getting more powerful with each passing day. There could be another war...
7769 : Oh, there's one thing you should know. Do you know why the Quadav took the Palborough Mines?
7770 : Humes claim that the Quadav stole the mines from them, but in reality, the mines are the Quadav's home...no, their holy land.
7771 : The Quadav would die rather than lose it. But the Humes in Bastok don't know, and they don't care to know.
7772 : Well, it's time for me to go. Oh, and my name is Lion. I'm an adventurer, like you. I'll be seeing you around.
7773 : Never mind, shouting at you won't change anything. You wanted to know about the beastmen, right?
7774 : I've heard rumors that those dumb Quadav are acting organized.
7775 : There's even talk that they have a leader now, like in the Great War...
7776 : Oh, and there's a strange magic circle at the deepest end of the Palborough Mines. It's said that whoever goes beyond it never comes back.
7777 : Sounds real suspicious, doesn't it? I'm sure you'll find your answers there.
7778 : Me? Oh, no. I'm never going back there. Good luck. You're gonna need it!
7779 : Ah, you must be the adventurer who is to join us on our mission. I have heard much about you.
7780 : We would like to hold a briefing soon. You will be allowed time to prepare for the mission afterwards, but the briefing might take a bit of time. Are you ready now?
7781 : When would you like to be briefed? Right away. Later.
7782 : Good. Come with me.
7783 : Hold, Milady! Where are you going!?
7784 : Oh, hi! Don't mind me, I'm just going to the Mines District!
7785 : Again? We Mythril Musketeers cannot chaperone you every time you decide to go on these excursions...
7786 : I know, that's why I'm going by myself! Don't worry, I'll be fine! Bye!
7787 : No, wait-- Drat!
7788 : Hey, where's she going?
7789 : Where's she going!? You, sir, were stationed to stop her!
7790 : But...but...
7791 : No talking back to senior Musketeers, Naji--or should I call you, Number Five?
7792 : Urgh...
7793 : Come on, get in!
7794 : Thank you all for coming on such short notice. Here is your mission: You are to mount an assault on the Quadav stronghold in Beadeaux.
7795 : Be forewarned that this is only to be a limited strike. Your main objectives are to coordinate tactics with experienced adventurers, and to familiarize yourselves with the local terrain.
7796 : As you see, some of our good adventuring friends have agreed to join the Musketeers on this operation.
7797 : Number Four, Ayame, planned this operation, so she will be in charge.
7798 : Number Five, Naji, will be assisting her. All of you are to follow their orders during the operation. Ayame, if you please?
7799 : First, we are to rendezvous in Beadeaux, near the entrance to the Quadav stronghold. Your targets are the Copper Quadav in charge of perimeter defense.
7800 : Each of you are to defeat twenty Copper Quadav. Once you have accomplished this objective, you are to disperse and retreat, then regroup at the entrance once again.
7801 : Don't forget, the rendezvous point is right inside Beadeaux! Nobody get lost, now!
7802 : You should talk. You'd even get lost in your own Mog House.
7803 : Once you are prepared, waste no time going to the rendezvous point. Dismissed.
7804 : The way to the rendezvous point is through the Pashhow Marshlands. It is right inside Beadeaux.
7805 : Walk across the Pashhow Marshlands to get to the rendezvous point. It's right inside Beadeaux. Make sure to bring everything you'll need!
7806 : The rendezvous point is across the Pashhow Marshlands, and right inside Beadeaux. Be prepared for anything.
7807 : Ah, you are here. Good.
7808 : You must have heard this already, but we need someone reliable to take on missions centered around our embassy in Jeuno.
7809 : I've talked to both the president and Captain Volker, and it is our unanimous opinion that you are the only person adequate for the task.
7810 : We will give you a letter of introduction, which you will present at our embassy in Jeuno to receive further instructions.
7811 : Hans, the letter.
7812 : Yes, sir. Here you go.
7813 : Good luck. I am counting on you.
7814 : You're back from Jeuno. No time to chat. Come with me.
7815 : You say someone snuck a familiar into the President's Office, but you were not warned of its presence?
7816 : Yes, sir. We were taken by surprise. I did not think anything like this was possible...
7817 : Sir Lucius did send me a report stating that our magical defenses were inadequate, but I didn't think that they would be so easy to break...
7818 : ...
7819 : Father!?
7820 : Cornelia...
7821 : Uncle Cid! Where's Father?
7822 : Calm down, Cornelia. We have the situation under control.
7823 : Is Father...? Please, tell me it's not true...!
7824 : Hmph. Don't make a scene. I'm not dead yet.
7825 : Father!
7826 : Cornelia, this does not concern you. Go to your room.
7827 : Lucius, explain what happened.
7828 : The familiar used magic to infiltrate the building...then it proceeded to cross the office straight toward the president's private chambers.
7829 : Fortunately, the president was awake at the time, and was not injured...
7830 : But they took the talisman.
7831 : The talisman!? The key to the Shadow Lord's seal!?
7832 : Twenty years ago, our allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord in the Northlands and sealed him away from our world. Chief Cid and Captain Volker were there, I believe.
7833 : The three parts of the key to the seal, the talismans, were given to each nation's leader for safekeeping. But now, at least one of them is gone...
7834 : Who would do such a thing?
7835 : Have you not found the culprit yet? Granted, there are many who bear ill feelings towards me...
7836 : But then again, those fools in the Senate are too busy squabbling with each other, and the Galka rebels are too savage to possess any magic skills...
7837 : ...
7838 : Father! Don't talk about the Galka that way!
7839 : Why are you still here? Did I not tell you to go to your room?
7840 : ...
7841 : From the reports we have received from the other nations, we must assume that the Kindred are trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.
7842 : Then we must go to the Northlands to investigate!
7843 : The Senate would have to approve before I can let the Mythril Musketeers go so far away from the city.
7844 : It would take too much time, and time is a luxury we cannot afford. Besides, the Senate has no sense of crisis--they would just reject my proposal.
7845 : Then...
7846 : We have to find someone with no legal constraints.
7847 : I am assigning you a mission, adventurer, and putting you under the Musketeers' jurisdiction.
7848 : You do not have to answer right away, but do you accept?
7849 : Accept the mission? Yes. I need some time.
7850 : Then let us talk in private. Volker, come with us.
7851 : Very well. Talk to the guard in charge of missions when you feel you are ready.
7852 : I hear you accepted the mission. Come with me.
7853 : First, let me tell you about your destination. You are to journey to the cursed Northlands, to the ruins of Fei'Yin. You will find the ruins at the northeastern corner of the Beaucedine Glacier.
7854 : The city of Fei'Yin was built in ancient times by a civilization far more advanced than ours.
7855 : We believe they called themselves the Zilart. There are many other ruins in Vana'diel thought to be of their making.
7856 : Considering how long ago they were built, their state of preservation is astounding. It is as if they are protected by some unseen force that defies time itself.
7857 : Thirty years ago, a multinational team was sent to the Northlands to try to uncover the secrets of the Zilart's power.
7858 : Ulrich, Volker's uncle--and the captain of the Mythril Musketeers at the time--led the Bastokan contingent of that expedition.
7859 : Unfortunately, they came back empty-handed.
7860 : ...
7861 : Captain Volker will tell you the way to your destination. He undertook the same journey twenty years ago, near the end of the Great War.
7862 : Even before the war, Fei'Yin was overrun with fiends. We captured it from the Shadow Lord at the cost of many lives.
7863 : After the war, we set seals on both sides of the border to keep the Shadow Lord's minions at bay. One seal in the ruined coliseum on the inside, and another in Fei'Yin on the outside.
7864 : That was twenty years ago. In those days, we could reach the Beaucedine Glacier from East Ronfaure through Ranguemont Pass.
7865 : That is still the only way there, but I believe San d'Oria is guarding that road now. You will have to find some way through.
7866 : Your objective is to ascertain that the seal in Fei'Yin is still intact. If it is not, replace it with the one we will be providing you.
7867 : You do have an airship pass, do you not?
7868 : Head to Jeuno, and take the flight to San d'Oria as soon as possible. You are dismissed.
7869 : Whoa! You made it back from Fei'Yin in one piece! Come with me, quick!
7870 : So...the seal in Fei'Yin was also broken.
7871 : Where were the San d'Orians!? It was their duty to protect it!
7872 : Mister President? Should we ask the Senate about an incursion to Zvahl?
7873 : We seem to have no other choice. But until they come to a decision, our hands are tied.
7874 : We would like you to stand by for further orders. We have preparations to make.
7875 : I heard you mention meeting a Galka dressed all in black in Fei'Yin. Tell me more about him.
7876 : As I thought...it is Zeid. Then he has been tracking the Kindred ever since he disappeared twenty years ago.
7877 : He was the Number Two Mythril Musketeer--the Galka named War Cloud. Ah...but he never liked being called by his Hume-given name.
7878 : He is the one who defeated the Shadow Lord... He should have been Captain, not I.
7879 : Still, why has he been hiding from us? What is there in the Northlands that would change Zeid, and even my uncle, so much?
7880 : Ah, I apologize. It is not my place to ask these questions. I am but a Musketeer, a humble soldier of Bastok.
7881 : Huh? No, this isn't the Blacksmiths' Guild. That's to the northwest.
7882 : Hey, you're an adventurer, right? I need % for one of my experiments.
7883 : Can you get me some? I've heard they appear during dust storms...
7884 : Go ask Drangord the Galka. He said he found some during his adventuring years.
7885 : %! Thanks, this will help me with my experiments! But I can always use more if you happen to come upon additional quantities.
7886 : Hmm...this machine's been acting up lately. I wonder if the oil's gone bad...
7887 : This machine needs oiling, but we're all out of machine oil. What could I use as a substitute, I wonder?
7888 : %? Of course! Why didn't I think of that? Thank you. Here, take this as payment.
7889 : My job's not that bad, really. Working with machines beats working in the mines any day.
7890 : Designing new products isn't easy. I don't know how Chief Cid does it, coming up with new inventions almost every week.
7891 : To be honest, it's not always easy working with Humes, but you get used to it. You have to.
7892 : You've got to be flexible, you know? You gotta keep up with the times. Otherwise you'll end up in the mines with the rest of the old, hard-headed Galka.
7893 : This is the Darksteel Forge. You must've heard of darksteel before.
7894 : Darksteel is an alloy harder yet more flexible than regular steel. What's more, it neither stains nor rusts. The only drawback is that it's a little heavy.
7895 : Its formula was a Galkan secret for a long time, but lately we've decided to teach Humes how to make it, too.
7896 : Knowing Humes, though, they would've figured it out eventually, and come up with something better.
7897 : Can I help you? This is the Cermet Refinery. Normally, only factory workers are allowed in, but...
7898 : Well, I guess you're okay. Do you know what cermet is? It's an alloy that's harder and lighter than steel, doesn't rust, and can withstand extreme heat. Amazing, isn't it?
7899 : It's the byproduct of recent breakthroughs in alchemy. Thanks to cermet, Chief Cid's engine designs are now years ahead of their time!
7900 : In fact, cermet...ah, no, I can't tell you any more. Just that...if we manage to find a way to cut down its production cost, we can put those Galka smiths on the spot!
7901 : This is the Cermet Refinery. The factory is off-limits to unauthorized personnel.
7902 : Then again, even if those anachronistic San d'Orians did manage to get in, they probably wouldn't be able to make heads or tails out of our instruments!
7903 : The younger Galka who work here answer to their Hume-given names, like pets to their master! Have they no shame!?
7904 : It is all because of the loss of our Talekeeper. If only Sir Raogrimm were here...
7905 : I've heard good things about you. It seems you're quite the adventurer now. I have a job for you.
7906 : It's...well, it's not a mission, or anything official. Just a personal favor.
7907 : There's a tavern in the Port District called the Steaming Sheep Restaurant. I want you to go see if the matron there needs any help.
7908 : And if she does, could you try to help her? Of course, I will reward you for your services.
7909 : %, huh? I think a certain crawler in the Crawlers' Nest drops them. Of course, you'll have to lure it out and defeat it first.
7910 : And to lure it out, you'll need to use %.
7911 : A letter?
7912 : ...
7913 : I-I see. Ms. Hilda said that, huh? But I didn't mean to--no, never mind. You've done what I asked. I'll give you a reward.
7914 : But please, don't tell anyone about this. Especially not Raibaht.
7915 : Did you say something, Chief?
7916 : Gah! Don't waste time talking! Get back to work!
7917 : An invitation from the Steaming Sheep? Hmm... Please do not mention this to the Chief. But tell the proprietor I will go visit her establishment as soon as I can.
7918 : Good of you to come. The reason why I didn't have Naji or Iron Eater bring you here is because the secrecy of this mission is paramount.
7919 : Volker will soon join us. Let us talk in my private chambers. Come.
7920 : Galina, tell Volker to come to my private chambers when he arrives.
7921 : We could not get the Senate's approval. The Musketeers won't be allowed to leave the city gates. Those fools think that Bastok should not get itself involved...
7922 : Let San d'Oria deal with the Northlands, they said! What do they think the Musketeers are for!? Surely they don't intend to use them in another war with San d'Oria!
7923 : I admit that Bastok would do anything for its own gain. That is how we have come so far--myself as well.
7924 : Bastok's success is a result of aggression and initiative. But with the Senate dawdling so, we may pay dearly for our lack of action.
7925 : Remember one thing: you are an adventurer, not a hero. You have no duty to the majority--especially one that chooses to stay idle at a time like this.
7926 : Go on this mission for your own gain. That is the Bastokan way. Do not concern yourself with responsibility--let a certain president and a Musketeer captain worry about that.
7927 : Volker. Come.
7928 : Tell the adventurer what you know of Castle Zvahl. We do not have much time. Be brief.
7929 : Cross the Beaucedine Glacier to the northernmost corner of Quon, the frozen land of Xarcabard.
7930 : There you will find Castle Zvahl, the Kindred's stronghold. That is where our allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord twenty years ago.
7931 : But now, someone is trying to bring the Shadow Lord back. We must stop them, no matter what the cost.
7932 : If you are too late, and they succeed...you and your friends must try to defeat the Shadow Lord yourselves, as Cid, Zeid, and I once did.
7933 : You adventurers hold the future of Vana'diel in your hands. We cannot accompany you, but our hopes and hearts go with you.
7934 : Go finish your preparations and leave as soon as possible. You are dismissed.
7935 : Wait... If you see Zeid, tell him that he has yet to best me in a fight...and that he should come back and challenge me.
7936 : You've done it! You stopped them from bringing back the Shadow Lord!?
7937 : What are you talking about, Volker? They probably defeated him and sent him back where he belongs! Am I right?
7938 : What? Defeat him? But that's...
7939 : Impossible? You find it hard to believe that some adventurer could defeat the Shadow Lord, Captain? Have you not heard what the townspeople are saying?
7940 : They're saying the Age of the Adventurers has come!
7941 : Hmph. Only historians, in posterity, have the privilege of saying such things.
7942 : And it does not matter if they only stopped the Shadow Lord from returning, or if they actually defeated him.
7943 : The important thing is that they kept the Kindred from gaining power. And that, I believe, deserves a reward.
7944 : Good work. I am raising your rank. And here is your well-deserved reward.
7945 : The Shadow Lord may have been vanquished again, but the Kindred are far from defeated. I have received reports of strange goings-on in the beastmen's strongholds.
7946 : You've probably heard this too many times, but...we're counting on you.
7947 : So that was who the Shadow Lord was... Zeid must have known, and that's probably why he went off on his own.
7948 : Don't tell Volker about this. Ulrich's fate should also be kept from him, too. He may not be able to accept it yet.
7949 : He admired his grandfather a lot...that's why it pained him to hear people say that Volker, himself, only became Captain because Raogrimm was gone.
7950 : I know that hiding the truth from him is not a good thing, but most of us are not as strong as you. We need time to heal.
7951 : Sorry to interrupt. What are you two talking about?
7952 : Uh...just saying that Karst really hasn't changed, even after all of this.
7953 : Yes, but I think I understand him better now. I may have been judging him too harshly.
7954 : Speaking of which...you still have not told us why you backed President Karst in the last elections, Chief.
7955 : Oh, that. Well... Fifteen years ago, even after I resigned my post as head of the Gunpowder Room, the Senate was still in chaos, trying to find more people to blame for the accident in Palborough.
7956 : But there was one junior senator there who proposed we abandon Palborough and reopen the Zeruhn Mines. That junior senator was Karst.
7957 : The miners stood to lose a lot, but at the time, his proposal was Bastok's best bet. I'm an engineer, so I respect skill. And I felt that Karst's political skills could be trusted.
7958 : And he's a real Bastoker, too--very ambitious, and real easy to figure out. I can still remember the eager look on his face when he announced his proposal to the Senate!
7959 : Hah hah hah!
7960 : Lady Cornelia is not here at the moment. I hope she doesn't stay out too late...
7961 : Lady Cornelia is in her room doing her studies. Please come back some other--
7962 : I've had enough of studying. I'm going out!
7963 : Milady, don't-- Oh, not again!
7964 : Why must she be like this? If the First Lady were still alive, she would never have tolerated this kind of behavior!
7965 : Lady Cornelia is in her room doing her studies. For once, she isn't--
7966 : No, Milady! Not this time! The president has given me strict orders not to let you out of your--
7967 : Hello. Come in.
7968 : Oh, you were expecting a guest! I'm sorry, I thought you were trying to sneak out--
7969 : Wait, Milady, no! You shouldn't be letting some adventurer into your room! You know the kind of places they frequent! And it wouldn't be proper!
7970 : Oh, brother... Can you believe her? This is what I have to put up with every day. I usually manage to sneak out, though.
7971 : I've been meaning to ask you--have you ever heard the story of Cornelia the Musketeer?
7972 : Have you ever heard of a Musketeer named Cornelia? Yes, I have. Who?
7973 : Cornelia, the monk who became a Mythril Musketeer, is pretty famous. She helped all those in need, whether they were Galka or Hume, rich or poor.
7974 : You've never heard of her? She was a monk who became a Mythril Musketeer. She helped all those in need, Galka and Hume, rich and poor alike.
7975 : It was rumored that she and Talekeeper Raogrimm--the only Galka destined to have become a Musketeer Captain if he were still alive--were sharing a forbidden love...
7976 : But no one knows if that was true, since neither returned from their expedition to Xarcabard thirty years ago.
7977 : My mother named me after her. She told me that she wanted me to grow up to be just like her--someone who would treat everyone equally, and loved by all.
7978 : Maybe that's why I try so hard to help the Galka...though even if I weren't named Cornelia, I wouldn't stand by and watch them be treated like they are.
7979 : But it's no good. You've seen it, too. I just can't seem to do anything right. I wish I were as strong and smart as Lady Cornelia...
7980 : This Galka child told me the other day, Why are you trying so hard? What can you do, you're just a girl!
7981 : Maybe he's right. Maybe I can't change anything...
7982 : No! I've got to try harder! I'll show that know-it-all, Gumbah, what I can do!
7983 : I'm sorry to leave you like this, but I've got to go!
7984 : These doors lead to the President's Office.
7985 : Enter the President's Office? Yes. No.
7986 : Exit the President's Office? Yes. No.
7987 : I am compiling data on the effects of Bastok's mining and industrial projects on the environment.
7988 : These wheels are enough to power Bastok now, but what will they do when the city's needs exceed the amount of energy they can produce?
7989 : I've heard adventurers say that the Quadav dumping of industrial waste has polluted Beadeaux and its surrounding areas.
7990 : I'd like to examine some of that %. I've heard you can find some near their forges, and that it's also easier to spot on rainy days.
7991 : Ah, you've brought me some of the % from Beadeaux I asked for! Thank you. This will help me in my research.
7992 : Hume scientists say they don't give a damn about the Quadav environment, but this may be of use to us in the future... Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to gripe. Here, let me reward you.
7993 : Look around you. Do you see what Bastokan technology can do? This technology is what makes us better than San d'Oria or even Windurst.
7994 : And thanks to that technology, I can let the machines do the work while I sit here and do nothing all day!
7995 : This water wheel square is the center of Bastok. That building to the east is the President's Office.
7996 : The Presidential Aide's Office is to the southeast, while the consulates of Jeuno, Windurst, and San d'Oria are, respectively, to the northeast, northwest, and southwest of the square.
7997 : It's locked.
7998 : That star is here...no, it's in that constellation there... Hm? What am I doing? Oh, I'm trying to match real stars with the ones on this map, but it's not as easy as it looks.
7999 : Say, you're an adventurer, aren't you? You must've been to a lot of places, seen many different skies... Would you like to take a look?
8000 : Look at the stellar map? Yes. No.
8001 : Oh, I-I'm sorry. Of course, you wouldn't be interested in stars... Goodbye!
8002 : I knew you'd be interested! This map was drawn by the famous Windurstian astronomer, Professor Lago-Charago!
8003 : See that constellation to the south? That's Bastok's guardian, Titan! But not many people know that now. It's been a long time since we've celebrated Titan's Eve.
8004 : The yellow star at its center is Daemdalus, or Titan's left foot. It used to be a lot brighter in the old days, and soldiers returning from battle followed it back to Bastok.
8005 : I'm glad to have met someone else who likes looking at the stars. Maybe we can talk about them more sometime.
8006 : You are in the Metalworks. Would you like to see a map of Bastok?
8007 : Look at map of Bastok? Yes. No.
8008 : Factories, the Blacksmiths' Guild, and administrative buildings--including the President's Office--are all here in the Metalworks.
8009 : The Blacksmiths' Guild is on the first floor. Ride the elevator up to the second floor and go east past the water wheels to get to the President's Office.
8010 : You've become quite an experienced adventurer, I hear. I feel I can trust you.
8011 : I need you to go on an errand for me. Our supply of % is running low. Bring us two of them.
8012 : The Zeruhn Mines haven't been yielding much of it lately. You may have better luck in the Gusgen Mines.
8013 : Thank you. Here is your payment. If you find any more, bring them here.
8014 : Hi. This is where blacksmiths buy what they need.
8015 : Hello. Welcome to the Blacksmiths' Guild shop.
8016 : We sell items in the Gunpowder Room, too. What do you need?
8017 : I've got some items you won't find elsewhere!
8018 : This is the Craftsmen's Eatery. Make room for the next customer when you're done, all right?
8019 : You can't fish here.
8020 : You can't fish without a rod in your hands.
8021 : You can't fish without bait on the hook.

8118 : Your chocobo refuses to partake of the %.
8119 : Hey, you're an adventurer, aren't you? I have this idea... I was thinking of providing tours of the surrounding areas to fledgling adventurers.
8120 : You know, if you show them really interesting sights, it'd make them want to go out and see more, right?
8121 : Of course, it won't be free once it gets going, but for now, I'm looking for volunteers to try it out and tell me what they think! No charge!
8122 : You wanna try? You'll have to be in a party where all members are level fifteen or less.
8123 : My partner, Hunting Bear, is waiting near Drachenfall in North Gustaberg. It's on the road that goes from North Gustaberg to Konschtat.
8124 : Meet up with him after you form a party that meets my requirements, and he'll pay you for taking part in the test.
8125 : Hmm... I guess starting a new kind of business is harder than I thought...
8126 : I've heard an adventurer say that there were these oily monsters in Beadeaux sometimes. I wonder...
8127 : There is an emergency. Promptly make your way to the President's Office. Ask Naji, and he will guide you.
8128 : Master Oggbi! There was no need for you to come all the way here. We would have come to you.
8129 : No, when I heard of his revival, my blood began to boil.
8130 : We think that it may be an offspring of the new generation of Yagudo. We also feel that the Kindred's rise in power may also factor into his return.
8131 : Currently, the Mythril Musketeers are comprised solely of warriors, samurai, and a missing dark knight. No competent monks exist.
8132 : San d'Oria is more than likely in the same predicament. The monastery is no longer able to produce the quality monks of old.  And Windurst...those Tarutaru and their magic aren't good for anything.
8133 : I've made attempts to contact Norg, but no one seems willing to cooperate...
8134 : If they won't even take up a proposal from someone who did her training there, they definitely won't listen to me.
8135 : Norg no longer has any interest in the way of the San d'Orian monks. Their attention has turned to the arts of the samurai and ninja.
8136 : And Dalzakk... Dalzakk is off on another mission, so that leaves only...
8137 : Why, if it isn't %! You'd be perfect for the job!
8138 : Do you think you'd be up to it?
8139 : Master Oggbi. I think our adventurer has yet to be informed on the details of this predicament.
8140 : It all began thirty years ago. A Yagudo with exponential power rose up in Vana'diel...
8141 : Master! Please let me go with you! I'm more than ready!
8142 : No, no, no! You may have enough power to draw that Yagudo out of hiding, but you still lack the experience to defeat him.
8143 : But Master, the reason I became your student was so I could gain enough skill to defeat him... So I could avenge my brother's death...
8144 : Do you think I didn't know that? Your brother was a talented monk who met a tragic death. When you came to me, I put two and two together.
8145 : However, your vision is still clouded...clouded by the darkness of revenge.
8146 : Master Oggbi... You have trained me well, and I thank you. But if you believe that my vision is still clouded...
8147 : ...Then I must set out on my own to clear it!
8148 : Cornelia...
8149 : And she succeeded in bringing down that Yagudo. Whether that cleared her vision or not...
8150 : Well, he shows interest in monks who are at his level of power, and only comes out when suitable opponents make their way into his lair.
8151 : Take % and place it deep within the castle. Your strength is certain to catch his eye and draw him out of hiding.
8152 : If you defeat him, he should leave %. Bring that back to me and I will reward you for your efforts.
8153 : This is a task that I should be taking on myself, but I just don't have the legs for it anymore...
8154 : This is... So you were able to defeat the Yagudo? I did not know such powerful monks still existed...
8155 : Long ago, Master Oggbi worked hard to promote the fusion of martial arts and San d'Orian combat techniques. Such a collaboration has obviously produced many outstanding fighters.
8156 : Even a samurai such as myself is in awe of your extraordinary ability. Please accept this as payment for your service.
8157 : Another item had been arranged for you, but Master Oggbi asked to present this to you instead.
8158 : I see you have returned safely... You have matured well as a monk.
8159 : This is a token of my gratitude. You remind me much of Cornelia...
8160 : Yes, I remember she came to see me in the Metalworks when she returned...
8161 : Cornelia! You're finally back...
8162 : Master... I apologize for creating so much trouble.
8163 : You need not worry of that... Your vision... Is it still clouded as before?
8164 : That's just it... I thought that by avenging my brother's death, I would be free of the demons that haunted me...but in truth, I feel as though a part of me died when I defeated that Yagudo...
8165 : I see...
8166 : Nothing comes of revenge. It merely results in us losing that which drives us.
8167 : You...
8168 : It is said that those with nothing to lose are often the strongest.
8169 : More than likely you felt the same way, Cornelia. But remember that if you have nothing to lose, you may have nothing at all...
8170 : ...nothing worth protecting. True strength comes to those who have something, or someone, to protect.
8171 : And you...have something worth protecting?
8172 : I carry with me over two hundred years of memories. At times they can be a burden, but it is my duty to protect them.
8173 : To protect the smiles of the people in those memories, I can handle the treatment I receive from those petty politicians in the President's Office.
8174 : Will I ever find something...something worth protecting?
8175 : I am certain that one day you will.
8176 : And that was the dawn of a new Musketeer in Cornelia.
8177 : You, too, must make a pledge--that you will never use your ability to lose something. Make that pledge, and your power will never betray you.
8178 : I still believe to this day that Cornelia made that pledge...
8179 : What? My grandma asked you to bring % to me?
8180 : I can't believe her. My grandson the doorman. I get teased enough by Ayame, but to be ridiculed by my own flesh and blood! And this sword... What's the big deal, anyway?
8181 : What's wrong, Naji?
8182 : Ah, Sir Iron Eater. My grandmother...
8183 : I see. This sword belonged to your father, Lord Yasin. This may even be the sword that he used when...
8184 : Sir? You have met my father before?
8185 : Once, thirty years ago... But I was still a child.
8186 : Welcome back, Sir Raogrimm! Did you beat up some Orcs this time?
8187 : Pagdako. My mission this time was a simple expedition. There was no beating up of any Orcs.
8188 : Yeah, but it makes no difference for a hired hand like me. I had me some fun, and found some good material for making a new sword to boot!
8189 : We bumped into this other party too... Yeah, some old monk traveling with a cute, feisty young girl.
8190 : I have no interest in the methods you use in finding good material, but I do know you are quite a fighter. It is a pity that you waste your talent on adventuring.
8191 : Oh, please. What adventures await me with the title of Musketeer? Guard duty? Heh, I'm no doorman!
8192 : You are a strange sort, Yasin. That material you brought back--I'll have one of my blacksmith companions make it into a sword for you. That will be your payment for your duties this time. Agreed?
8193 : Sounds good to me, Musketeer.
8194 : When I grow up, I wanna be a big, brave Musketeer, just like Sir Raogrimm!
8195 : Pagdako, being a Musketeer is not necessarily about going out on missions and fighting monsters. At times, we must deal with enemies who are behind our own walls. If you can handle that burden as well, I believe you will make a fine Musketeer indeed.
8196 : There's no doubt about it. That sword is the one that Sir Raogrimm--the Mythril Musketeer and Galka Talekeeper himself--had made for your father.
8197 : Wow... I never knew that my father knew such important people. And Sir Iron Eater, I never knew your real name was...what did you say it was, Pacdaco?
8198 : ...... Feel free to call me whichever is easiest for you to pronounce. It makes no difference to me. A name is not important, only the man behind it.
8199 : Well, thanks for bringing this to me. I'll try to use it as my father did. Here, you can have this. It's been used quite a bit, but I'm sure you'll find a good home for it.
8200 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
8201 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
8202 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
8203 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
8211 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
8212 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
8213 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
8214 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
8215 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
8216 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
8217 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
8218 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
8219 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
8220 : You've earned conquest points!
8221 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
8222 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
8223 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
8224 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
8225 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
8226 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
8227 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
8228 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
8229 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
8230 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
8231 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
8232 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
8233 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
8234 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
8235 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
8236 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
8237 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
8238 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
8239 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
8240 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
8241 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
8242 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
8243 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
8244 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
8245 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
8246 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
8247 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
8248 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
8249 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
8250 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
8251 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
8252 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
8253 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
8254 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
8255 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
8256 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
8257 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.
8258 : Which E.F. would you like to join? . . . . . . The Zulkheim Region (Lv.20). The Norvallen Region (Lv.25). . The Derfland Region (Lv.25). . The Kolshushu Region (Lv.20). The Aragoneu Region (Lv.25). The Fauregandi Region (Lv.35). The Valdeaunia Region (Lv.40). The Qufim Region (Lv.25). The Li'Telor Region (Lv.35). The Kuzotz Region (Lv.40). The Vollbow Region (Lv.65). The Elshimo Lowlands Region (Lv.35). The Elshimo Uplands Region (Lv.45). . . . . . . . . . . None.
8259 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
8260 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
8261 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
8262 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
8263 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
8264 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
8265 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.
8266 : You currently have # conquest points. Would you like to use them to purchase items?
8267 : Which item do you wish to purchase? Common items (all ranks). 1000-pt. items (rank 1 required). 2000-pt. items (rank 2 required). 4000-pt. items (rank 3 required). 8000-pt. items (rank 4 required). 16000-pt. items (rank 5 required). 24000-pt. items (rank 6 required). 32000-pt. items (rank 7 required). 40000-pt. items (rank 8 required). 48000-pt. items (rank 9 required). 56000-pt. items (rank 10 required).

Cancel.
8269 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
8270 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
8271 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.
8272 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 100 conquest points.
8273 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 200 conquest points.
8274 : During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
8275 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
8276 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.
8277 : The % is already fully charged.
8278 : Your % has received # [charge/charges] in exchange for # [conquest point/conquest points]. It is now fully recharged.
8279 : I will trade you % for your %. May it serve you well.
8280 : You do not meet the requirements to purchase the %.
8281 : Your rank is too low to purchase the %.
8282 : You do not have enough conquest points to purchase the %.
8283 : You cannot equip the %. Do you still wish to proceed?
8284 : Your level is too low to equip the %. Do you still wish to proceed?
8285 : You seem to be able to equip the %. Do you wish to proceed?
8286 : Are you sure you want to purchase the %?
8287 : Proceed? Yes, purchase item. Cancel purchase.

8291 : ENDPARA#
8292 : Which service do you request? Buy/Sell items. Teleportation. Nothing.
8293 : Do you really wish to be teleported? Yes. Teleport with gil. Teleport with conquest points. No.
8294 : Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
8295 : It should please you to know that I now also deal in %. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!
8296 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
8297 : I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
8298 : I can teleport you to your home country for # gil or # conquest [point/points].
8299 : Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered.  Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
8300 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
8301 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
8302 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
8303 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
8304 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
8305 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points moderately. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
8306 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points greatly. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
8307 : I could not accept one or more items you tried to trade me. Please remove those items and try again.
8308 : Sorry. I can only take certain types of weapons, shields, or armor.
8309 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points [by a small amount/moderately/greatly]. For this transaction I will also furnish you with # gil.
8310 : My apologies, but this type of item needs to be individually appraised. Please trade them to me one at a time.
8311 : (DEBUG) Back to hometown!
8312 : What do you want? Would you cast Signet on me? I'd like to set my home point here. Nothing.
8313 : What do you want? Pay # gil and set my home point here. Nothing.
8314 : Your home point has been set.
8315 : You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.
8316 : I will set your home point here.
8317 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
8318 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
8319 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
8320 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
8321 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
8322 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
8323 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
8324 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
8325 : There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
8326 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.
8327 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
8328 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
8329 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
8330 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
8331 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
8332 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
8333 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...
8334 : Cancel your participation in the E.F. to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?
8335 : Quit the E.F.? Yes. Change locations. No.
8336 : Are you sure?
8337 : Really quit the E.F.? Yes. No.
8338 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
8339 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
8340 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
8341 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
8342 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
8343 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
8344 : You received # conquest points!
8345 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
8346 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
8347 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
8348 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
8349 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
8350 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
8351 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
8352 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
8353 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
8354 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
8355 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
8356 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
8357 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
8358 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
8359 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
8360 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
8361 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
8551 : PAUSE
8553 : You're a dark knight, I see. I have a favor to ask that may be of some interest to you.
8554 : The Galka methods of darksteel-working are recently being looked on in a different light. This, coupled with the recent rise in adventurers bringing in darksteel ore, has resulted in an increase in the production of darksteel goods.
8555 : This is why I need an old book called %.
8556 : I heard that it was once kept here in the Metalworks, but I have no knowledge of its present location.
8557 : They say that in the olden days, all dark knight equipment was forged from darksteel. I would be willing to repay you handsomely if you could retrieve that book for me.
8558 : What? You say Raibaht is searching for the book %?
8559 : I see he's finally come to his senses. I've been trying to get him to ask Chief Cid to pour more money into the darksteel program.
8560 : Well, knowing Raibaht, he probably had to think and re-think it, but he still hasn't made up his mind. Hopefully, seeing % will help to push him in the right direction.
8561 : The problem is, % was donated to a library somewhere before I was appointed to this position.
8562 : And on top of that, there's no record of the donation anywhere. I guess I can't complain. That was back in the day when mythril was the material of choice, cermet was getting all the funding, and darksteel...well, darksteel was about as popular as rusty buckets...
8563 : ...and worth about the same, too.
8564 : I will write a letter to the library holding the document. You will need to take this letter and show it to the proprietor of the library.
8565 : Excellent! You've retrieved our copy of %! Quickly, take it to Raibaht.
8566 : Yes, this is the book I was in search of. Please accept this for your troubles. It is a sample product forged by our head smith--and I assure you, it is of the highest quality.
8567 : Now I can continue my research on the forging of darksteel...and make a decision on whether or not to ask Chief Cid for more funding.
8568 : You were going to ask me what, now?
8569 : I am just working on a personal project.
8570 : Every time you say that, it means you're up to something.
8571 : What's this? Ah-ha, %...
8572 : Allow me to carry out this research, Chief Cid. I am sure you are busy with your numerous projects.
8573 : Now, now. Don't you worry about that. It's not what's in the book that interests me... It's the name of the person who wrote it.
8574 : Gerwitz... I'm positive I've heard that name somewhere before...
8575 : I will investigate the author for you as well. If you spend too much time poking around, Chief, people will get the wrong idea...
8576 : That's it! I remember now!
8577 : Gerwitz--the guy who wrote %! He was the one who forged Zeid's armor.
8578 : A strange guy, that Zeid. I never thought he'd tell me where he had gotten that armor.
8579 : What is that? You say you have met Zeid? A wee bit detached from the rest of the world, don't you think? Still, he fought alongside Volker and me during the Great War, and he was the one who defeated the Shadow Lord in the end.
8580 : Well, not really by my side. I was mainly in the back, servicing the cannons...
8581 : Chief. I forgot to give you this letter from Zeid.
8582 : What!? You mean that brooding recluse actually sent me a letter...? Why didn't you give this to me sooner!?
8583 : It only arrived earlier today.
8584 : So, what does old Zeid have to say? Hmm... Disturbing activity...a strange type of evil weapon...with a sword made by...Gerwitz!?
8585 : What could this mean...? Does Zeid know something that we don't...?
8586 : If you meet up with Zeid any time soon, could you help him with his investigation? Any information you can get us will shed some light on his movements.
8587 : Obtained: # %.
8588 : Hey, that's one of those Quadav dolls. I used to collect those for good luck.
8589 : I don't think that's something I would be boasting about, Naji.
8590 : S-Sir Lucius!
8591 : Some theorize that the Palborough Mines were once holy lands for the Quadav, and that Bastok forced the beastmen from their land.
8592 : And those dolls that you collect are actually idols representing their ancestral hero.
8593 : Of course, this has nothing to do with your mission. Those pieces you have brought back are nothing more than proof of your success.
8594 : But remember this, Naji. Things in the world often look different depending on where you stand. Even though we are not obligated to search for knowledge, truth is only found by those who have the will...
8595 : You know, sometimes I just don't get what he's saying. He's usually like that after battling it out with the senators. Poor guy...
8596 : Great! You brought me %!
8597 : I asked you to bring me this because I'm thinking of using it in my next project. % can only be found in the Gusgen Mines, and with the mines being deserted for so many years...
8598 : Chief Cid. Do you think it would be possible to borrow that % after you have completed your project?
8599 : Oh? This is a surprise. It's not every day that you ask me a favor.
8600 : It is said that the Gusgen Mines are a haven for paranormal activity. Priests from the San d'Oria Cathedral have even performed certain rituals of consecration there. As far as magic research is concerned, it's certainly a significant location.
8601 : I have the feeling that I'm about to get a lecture on why the presidential aide shouldn't be dabbling in magic.
8602 : Don't get me wrong, Lucius. I don't know squat about magic, but I've never questioned its power.
8603 : I know darn well that you've spent your career trying to get the people of Bastok to see the benefits of magic.
8604 : You managed to get San d'Oria to cooperate with us in the creation of new magic spells by making good use of the results of my Crystal Line research. Those new spells have helped bring many mage adventurers to Bastok.
8605 : So never doubt your cause. Here, take this %. My research can wait.
8606 : I...I am at a loss for words...
8607 : And let me tell you one more thing. You don't go and overwork yourself, hear? You're one of the few people in this city who Karst needs. You go down, and he goes down.
8608 : There has been some commotion in the Mines District near Ore Street. People are saying that a new Talekeeper has appeared.
8609 : It sounds fishy to me, but with the disappearance of their elder, Werei, anything could be possible. And the last thing we want is an uprising by the Galka.
8610 : Go to Ore Street and talk to Medicine Eagle. He says he was there when the commotion started.
8611 : I assume an adventurer of your caliber has heard of Norg.
8612 : Well, the place is a haven for pirates. They even have ties with the Tenshodo. In any case, it's an area that cannot be looked upon lightly.
8613 : That is why we want you to travel there as an emissary. Report to Sir Naji in the President's Office for details.
8614 : Currently, Chief Engineer Cid is conducting research on the architecture in Ro'Maeve near the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. Your next mission is to travel there and assist him.
8615 : Report to the Chief Engineer in the Metalworks for further details.
8616 : We are searching for an adventurer holding vital information dealing with a certain national investigation.
8617 : The president himself has expressed great interest in this case. Proceed to the President's Office for the details of this mission.
8618 : You've been ordered by the president to deliver that %. When you have completed that task, you can return here for your next mission.
8619 : It looks like Bastok is really going to begin an investigation of the Galka homeland of Altepa.
8620 : Your role in this investigation will have you traveling to the Quicksand Caves. Get the details of this mission from Iron Eater in the President's Office.
8621 : As a continuation of Bastok's investigation of Altepa, this time you will be traveling to Zepwell Island.
8622 : You will be carrying out your part of the investigation in the Kuftal Tunnel, which connects Cape Teriggan to Zepwell Island. Report to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines for details.
8623 : Senator Alois has asked for your assistance.
8624 : It is something about an expedition to Vollbow...
8625 : I just hope he's not asking you to go get lizard eggs again... Wait, you didn't hear me say that.
8626 : Recently, an adventurer who was sent to investigate the Northlands has been attacked.
8627 : According to her report, the attacker resembled the dark knight Zeid.
8628 : The strange thing is that the attacker passed a letter to the adventurer before letting her go. Now, this letter's content is causing quite a commotion in the President's Office.
8629 : You have been asked to report directly to President Karst for further details.
8630 : Ah, %. It looks like you're ready for your next mission. I've heard that you're traveling to Norg this time.
8631 : What? I'm supposed to be giving you the details? That's funny. I don't remember being assigned to this mission...
8632 : It looks as if the guard mixed the two of us up--as if that could happen. I'm the one who will be relaying the adventurer's orders.
8633 : As if that could happen!?
8634 : Your mission to Norg is that of a trade emissary.
8635 : Norg is constantly attempting to strengthen its ties with adventurers. They often rely on them to do certain jobs involving trade.
8636 : Compared to Windurst and San d'Oria, Bastok's relations with Norg run much deeper. That is why, for the sake of our republic's commerce, we are sending adventurers to such a remote location.
8637 : I was to accompany you on this mission, but first I must complete another small task.
8638 : Travel to Norg and meet with their leader, Gilgamesh. He will give you further information on what you are to do. I will rendezvous with you in Norg when I have finished my current assignment.
8639 : And that's the gist of it... Wait. Before you go, could you come over here for a second?
8640 : The reason I called you over here is that I want you to try to finish this mission ASAP...preferably, before Ayame arrives.
8641 : I know this must sound strange, but you've got to help me out here. Recently Ayame has been acting...well, strange. It's like she's missing that, that something.
8642 : The other day, she was defeated by an enemy that, well, even you could take out.
8643 : And now she's using that as an excuse to restart her samurai training.
8644 : You can probably tell by looking at me, but we Mythril Musketeers don't spend much time out there on the front lines.
8645 : That makes it hard for us to keep our battle skills brushed up. I think that's what's bothering Ayame. She wants to get back what she thinks she has lost.
8646 : And now she wants to travel to Norg. That will just make things worse!
8647 : As much as I want to be number four, I don't want it because she leaves. That's why she's got to remain a Musketeer.
8648 : You know what you've got to do! And keep quiet about this to Ayame...
8649 : You're finally back from Norg. So, did you see Ayame?
8650 : You mean, she said all of that?
8651 : I guess she went to Norg to reconfirm what she already knew deep down in her heart.
8652 : Hey, don't you go off telling her that I was worried about her, now!
8653 : It's just that, well, Ayame gets all the good missions while I get zilch. I wish I got to go to Norg...
8654 : I don't think Norg needs any more doorboys.
8655 : Yeah, you're probably right...
8656 : Wait a minute! What do you mean, doorboy!?
8657 : You move one inch from your post and I'll have you on latrine duty!
8658 : Yes, ma'am. All clear on the northern front...
8659 : Ah, it's nice to see you again. But enough with the greetings; let me tell you about your next mission.
8660 : You've heard of the ancient civilization of the Zilart, haven't you? Well, there are archeological remains of this civilization scattered about Vana'diel.
8661 : The Zilart used a material called cermet to construct many of these structures. This cermet is more advanced than anything found in Bastok.
8662 : Researching and reproducing this material would do wonders for Bastok's industry. Ancient cermet technology is the building block of the future, so to speak.
8663 : Deep within the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah you will find the entrance to Ro'Maeve. I want you to bring me some % from there.
8664 : I'll be waiting for you here.
8665 : Ha ha! You got your hands on %! Now I can continue my cermet research.
8666 : Chief Cid...
8667 : Don't you go getting your feathers ruffled, Raibaht. I'm not going to be making any cuts in darksteel research.
8668 : Chief, we have a visitor.
8669 : Thank you.
8670 : What's wrong, Cornelia? Did you have a fight with your father again?
8671 : It's not anything like that...but it does have to do with my father.
8672 : Just a few minutes ago, I met with this young Galka.
8673 : Oh! There you are, Cornelia!
8674 : Gumbah! Why did you follow me?
8675 : I had something I wanted to ask you, and I was worried about what I was going to do if I couldn't find you.
8676 : Hey, wait. You aren't going to send me on one of your weird quests, are you? I can't trust you after the last time.
8677 : I never made you do anything that weird! Anyway, this time is different. I want you to search for Werei for me.
8678 : You mean the same Werei that you lived with a while back? The same Werei that disappeared...
8679 : He hasn't disappeared... He's set out on his journey of rebirth. I don't expect to ever see him in the form of Werei again.
8680 : But, leaving without saying anything... It just doesn't make any sense. There must be some reason.
8681 : And so I thought that if I asked you, you might be able to do something. The situation in the Mines District is not getting any better, and any information would help.
8682 : But, I don't know if I could be of any help...
8683 : What do you mean? Your dad's the president. Couldn't you just ask him to help you out?
8684 : How did you know that...!?
8685 : You think I didn't already know? Everybody knows. Are you still in the dark?
8686 : Well...even if I am the president's daughter, I can't use my position like that. It wouldn't be right.
8687 : What do you mean? You're always saying that you want to help the Galka!
8688 : You weren't lying, were you? Or was that just your way of showing pity for us poor Galka?
8689 : Gumbah! How could you say that? Of course I want to help you, it's just that...
8690 : You're just saying that to make your ego feel better. Whether you like it or not, you are in a position of power.
8691 : Why don't you use that power? Stop trying to run from...it...
8692 : What!? If you have something to say to me, say it!
8693 : I'm sorry, Cornelia. I didn't mean that... Forget what I said. I'll try searching for Werei on my own.
8694 : That Gumbah! I can't believe him sometimes!
8695 : So, did you talk to your father?
8696 : No... I couldn't ask him for help.
8697 : Cornelia. I'm just a simple engineer. I don't know what the best choice is here.
8698 : But I do know one thing...
8699 : Back in the days when Bastok was filled with old wooden houses, there was a big fire that wiped out most of the homes.
8700 : However, at that time Bastok was a poor country, and very few funds could be used for the rebuilding of the houses.
8701 : Two propositions were offered to the government. One was to collect donations.
8702 : The other was to give priority to the merchants of that area in exchange for contributions to the rebuilding. That was the plan proposed by your young father.
8703 : Which do you think is right, Cornelia?
8704 : Asking...for the donations of people?
8705 : I guess that is one way of solving the problem. That's what the president at that time chose, and it helped get him votes.
8706 : However, six months went by, and the rebuilding of the district was not even close to being finished. There were still people living out on the streets with no place to go.
8707 : Your father's plan was finally put into effect, and slowly but surely, the district began to take shape once again.
8708 : Maybe it's just the engineer in me talking, but I think that when you're too busy choosing the parts, you sometimes lose sight of what you're really trying to make.
8709 : Don't you go and forget what you're trying to make now, Cornelia. You have to decide what you're going to do.
8710 : Oh, %. I'm sorry you had to hear all that. You can go now. I'll make the report.
8711 : This % you brought me... This will help me get closer to what I'm really trying to make.
8712 : Thank you for coming, %. Currently, we are investigating the whereabouts of a certain Galka named Werei. You have heard of him, have you not?
8713 : It sounds like another aging Galka has just set off on his journey of rebirth, but the residents of the Mining District are not taking this very well.
8714 : There is so much bigotry when it comes to these racial problems, it is hard to act on anything.
8715 : However, there is one thing that interests me. There is a rumor that a certain adventurer has received a letter from this Werei.
8716 : I would like you to find this adventurer and find out what he knows. However...
8717 : Come, follow me.
8718 : Milady. An adventurer would like to speak with you.
8719 : Does this mean my father has finally agreed to start an investigation!?
8720 : Father! What is the meaning of this!?
8721 : Don't get me wrong, Cornelia. If you want to lock yourself up in this room, I won't stop you.
8722 : I have received a report from Iron Eater stating that finding the whereabouts of Werei may help calm down some of the Galka in the Mines District.
8723 : I am only here to gather information on the subject from those who may know something--namely you. I have no time for your petty games.
8724 : But, when I tried talking to you before, you wouldn't...
8725 : Do you have any information for me? If not, I will assign this adventurer to another mission, and that will be the end of things.
8726 : Wait... I did hear something at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant. An adventurer named Hani...
8727 : This adventurer said he met Werei while traveling through the Korroloka Tunnel, and received a letter from him.
8728 : However, since then, no one has seen him.
8729 : The proprietor of the Steaming Sheep, Hilda, may know more...
8730 : Understood. % will take the investigation from here.
8731 : Wait, Father.
8732 : Am...am I foolish to think I can make a difference, or am I just a hypocrite?
8733 : Cornelia...
8734 : I once heard a Far Eastern legend that stated hypocrisy is born from the acts of good that one performs.
8735 : Whereas the word used to symbolize a simple act of human nature, over the years, the meaning of the word became warped to the negative tone that it holds today.
8736 : Whenever anyone tries to do anything, there will always be someone there to judge them. I have experienced that my whole life, but it has never stopped me from pursuing my goals.
8737 : I won't let anyone stand in my way.
8738 : You've got a good ten years before you can start complaining about what is right and what is wrong. Don't forget that.
8739 : Father...
8740 : %. You have your orders. Speak with Hilda at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant and find out more on this Hani character.
8741 : Lady Cornelia has locked herself in her room and will not come out...
8742 : What is this you say? The Hani in question got himself caught by the Quadav? By the sounds of it, you adventurers have quite a carefree lifestyle.
8743 : Well, no matter. We can now be certain that Werei set out on his journey of his own free will. Let me reward you for your service and raise your rank.
8744 : The letter you carry--deliver it to the proper recipient. I am not going to let this problem escalate by meddling with it. Let the Galka see the truth with their own eyes.
8745 : I see that you already delivered the letter to its proper recipient. I am not going to let this problem escalate by meddling with it. Let the Galka see the truth with their own eyes.
8746 : We've been expecting you. Captain Volker is awaiting your arrival in the Conference Room.
8747 : Ah, %. For your next mission, I would like you to travel to the Altepa Desert to investigate the Quicksand Caves. These caves are an important location amongst the ruins of the Galkan civilization.
8748 : Why, you ask, are we starting an investigation into the Galkan ruins?
8749 : It all started with a letter addressed to Iron Eater.
8750 : The time has come to unlock the past and step forth into the future. I await the adventurer near the statue of the Talekeeper in the Quicksand Caves.
8751 : There is no name on the letter, but I know who wrote it... Zeid.
8752 : If I could, I would like to go myself. However, if I did, Zeid would most certainly not show up.
8753 : You met with Zeid when you defeated the Shadow Lord. If he would talk with anyone, it would be you.
8754 : Your mission is to seek out this statue of the Talekeeper and find out what Zeid meant about unlocking the past.
8755 : The Quicksand Caves are shrouded in mystery. There is not much we know of the area. You may face many hardships during your investigation, but we are counting on your success.
8756 : I welcome you back from your journey. What did you find in the Quicksand Caves?
8757 : I see... The history of the Galka...
8758 : Zeid must feel the same as I do--that this is a turning point in our history.
8759 : However, his mention of the Talekeeper... Does he really believe that a new one is among us?
8760 : And why would Zeid suddenly want to see Volker? What shall I tell the  captain...?
8761 : Ah, excuse me. Excellent work on your mission. I will handle things from here. However, I feel that we may require your future services for an investigation of Zepwell Island.
8762 : I never thought that Gumbah... And to think that we could have been putting extra pressure on him without even knowing it.
8763 : It is time to call forth an end to the era of one Galka holding on to ancient history.
8764 : It is time that we start working towards carving a new history here, in Bastok.
8765 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
8766 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.

8783 : That region is under your home country's control.
8784 : That region is no longer under your home country's control.
8785 : That region is under allied control.
8786 : That region is under beastman control.
8787 : That region is neutral.
8788 : Welcome to the Regional Teleportation Service!
8789 : Greetings, adventurer. My name is . I have been sent by the Specialty Goods Trade Union.
8790 : At the previous Conference of Nations, it was decided that the restriction on regional teleporting would be lifted, and that cities could now offer teleportation services to various outposts.
8791 : We are now authorized to teleport you to any outpost you have previously visited on a supplies quest.
8792 : The nominal fee we require varies with the current control of the region.
8793 : Also, depending on your level, there may be some areas I am not authorized to teleport you to.
8794 : That region is [no longer under your home country's control./currently under your home country's control.] You will require # gil or # conquest [point/points] to teleport.
8795 : As a special, limited-time service to commemorate the recovery of the full mog tablet set, I can teleport you to your destination absolutely free of charge!
8796 : Teleport? Yes. Teleport with gil. Teleport with conquest points. Later.
8797 : Have a wonderful journey!
8798 : Unfortunately, at this time there is nowhere I can teleport you. Please come again.
8799 : You have not yet reached level 10. I am sorry, but for safety reasons, I am not authorized to teleport anyone under the current level cap.
8800 : You do not have enough gil. Please come back again.
8801 : You do not have enough gil.
8802 : You do not have enough conquest points. Please come back again.
8803 : You do not have enough conquest points.
8804 : We look forward to seeing you again!
8805 : However, at this time I am only authorized to teleport citizens of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].
8806 : Debug: Warp to region #!
8807 : For a limited time during the Starlight Celebration, the Specialty Goods Trade Union is offering all registered adventurers a deal you could not possibly think of passing up.
8808 : Trade me a mere ten % and I will teleport you to the outpost of any region of your choice, regardless of your current level or which nation has control of the area.
8809 : However, remember that the S.G.T.U will take no responsibility for any...unexpected circumstances that may occur as a result of teleporting to an area with enemies beyond the range of your main job's level.
8810 : Normally, I am only authorized to teleport citizens of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], but for a limited time only, my services are open to all registered adventurers.
8811 : Trade me a mere ten % and I will teleport you to the outpost of any region of your choice, regardless of your current level or which nation has control of the area.
8812 : However, remember that the S.G.T.U will take no responsibility for any...unexpected circumstances that may occur as a result of teleporting to an area with enemies beyond the range of your main job's level.
8813 : This service will last for the duration of the Starlight Celebration.
8814 : Thank you very much for taking part in our holiday special!
8815 : If I remember correctly, you just made your payment a few moments ago.
8816 : I apologize, [sir/ma'am]. You have not completed any supplies quests, thus there are no regions to which I am authorized to teleport you.
8817 : The recommended level for the requested area is #. Are you sure you would like to teleport there?
8818 : Your ten % are returned to you.
8819 : Your inventory is full and you cannot carry the %. Come back when you have created more room in your bag.
8820 : Ah, you're finally here. Now let me inform you of your next mission. There is a rare type of salt that can only be found in the Vollbow Region.
8821 : I would like you to retrieve some of this sumptuous sodium for me.
8822 : Sir! You are not sending our loyal citizens out on missions to obtain personal items again, are you?
8823 : I cannot allow it. A line must be drawn between personal matters and matters of the state!
8824 : Watch your mouth, soldier! How dare a lowly Musketeer question my judgment!
8825 : I am thinking only of the well-being of the citizens of the Republic... Furthermore, the budget for this mission has already been approved by the Senate.
8826 : The well-being of the citizens? Our nation's stock of rocksalt is plentiful. We do not need any more. If you want to focus on the well-being of the citizens, focus more on those starving in the Mines District!
8827 : If you have enough gil in the budget to fund such a foolish mission, why not use some of that money to improve the output of the mills in Konschtat?
8828 : Calm down, Iron Eater.
8829 : Gumbah? Why are you here?
8830 : Oh, I just came to thank a friend.
8831 : What is a dirty little Galka doing in the President's Office?
8832 : Dirty little Galka!? You don't know anything about what happened in the Mines District?
8833 : That is of no matter, Iron Eater. Senator Alois, this salt you are talking of--if I am not mistaken, it is called %. I have heard many things of this seasoning.
8834 : Such as, it can slow the hands of aging on the clock of life.
8835 : Exactly. At this age, I have to think of my health...
8836 : I knew you were only thinking of yourself...
8837 : Ahem. I have heard that the area it is found in is extremely dangerous. Therefore, rather than risking the lives of less experienced adventurers, I thought it would be in our best interest to send one more competent. Say, the one who defeated the Shadow Lord.
8838 : I cannot even believe what I am hearing...
8839 : Hmmm... That sounds like an excellent idea.
8840 : What...?
8841 : (Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.)
8842 : Anyway, it does not matter whether you like it or not. The mission has already been approved by the Senate, and this fine adventurer has already accepted it.
8843 : %, you are to travel to Rabao and obtain further details on your task from Dancing Wolf. He has already been sent to investigate the location of the salt.
8844 : Iron Eater, I have a favor to ask of you. Come and see me later.
8845 : Understood... I will trust the judgment of our Talekeeper.
8846 : Talekeeper? That sounds so formal...
8847 : So, %, can I count on your help, too? Don't worry. I won't let this end up as a mere grocery run for our fine senator.
8848 : Did you have this salt inspected by Dancing Wolf before bringing it to me? How am I supposed to know that this is truly % if you haven't had it checked? Back to Rabao with you!
8849 : Ah, I've already read the report from the guard in Rabao. I assume you're carrying the salt with you.
8850 : Yes... This salt will add another five years to my--I mean, our citizens' lives.
8851 : That sounds wonderful, Alois.
8852 : Well, if it isn't the president's little pet. What business do you have here?
8853 : I am pleased to know that you will be working hard to make sure that % is used to better improve the lives and welfare of the citizens of Bastok.
8854 : If I find that you have not, I will be sending a bill, covering all expenses, to your company.
8855 : Hm? I don't know what you're talking about.
8856 : I have learned that the funds received for this mission and the further research of the salt have been deposited into one of your companies' accounts.
8857 : If the results of your research are beneficial to the Bastokan Republic, I am sure no one will have any problem with this minute detail. However, if it is learned that nothing has come of this mission, you will be ordered to promptly return all the gil you have received...plus interest.
8858 : But you should already know all this. It was announced at last month's senate meeting... Oh wait, if I recall, you were asleep for half of the session.
8859 : How...how dare you!
8860 : And if you are considering putting pressure on the investigators of this case, you may want to reconsider. I shall personally be heading up the team.
8861 : Finally, a piece of advice for you, senator. If you really want to live longer, you should cut down on the %.
8862 : Why, I...I...
8863 : And I guess that is that. But how did Gumbah know what the senator was really up to...?
8864 : Well, I guess that is of no concern to us. I commend you on the completion of this mission. You will be informed when your services are again required.
8865 : However, we may require your services sooner than you expect.
8866 : It seems as if one of our adventurers was attacked while on an investigation in the Northlands...
8867 : The young politicians these days have no respect for their elders! Why, in my day...
8868 : Milady! I will not allow you to sneak out of your chambers again, and I will definitely not allow any adventurers in here.
8869 : Oh, %. My father sent you, right?
8870 : The president! I...I apologize. Please proceed...
8871 : Wait... Milady! I have not heard of any meetings with any adventurers! You have tricked me! Milady!
8872 : Franziska means well, but she's got to loosen up, don't you think?
8873 : Anyway, you'll never guess who was here just a couple of days ago.
8874 : I can't believe that my father would even let him near this place...
8875 : Gumbah. Gumbah came here, to my room. He didn't say anything for the first few minutes, but when he opened his mouth, the first words out were thank you.
8876 : Thank you. What did he mean? I haven't done anything worth thanking. I've only caused him pain and trouble.
8877 : For someone who has lived more than two hundred years, he's not that good with telling people how he feels. But, you know, I'm kind of happy that he told me what he did...
8878 : I've only been on Vana'diel for a tenth of time he has, so I can't really talk about being good at expressing feelings...
8879 : Anyway, once the ice was broken, we started talking about all sorts of stuff.
8880 : For some reason, he seemed really interested in one of Lucius' new programs. I wonder what that was all about?
8881 : Milady! It is time for your studies!
8882 : Yes, Franziska! I know!
8883 : You know, I think I'm going to start putting a little more effort into my studies. I think I finally know what I want to be when I get older.
8884 : What do I want to be? I can't tell you yet. That's still a secret.
8885 : Well, you should probably go before Franziska has Iron Eater drag you out. Thanks for coming and listening to me.
8886 : Recently, Lady Cornelia has taken up an interest in her studies. However, how long this will last, I do not know...
8887 : We've been waiting for you, %. Some unbelievable events have taken place recently...
8888 : It seems as if the dark knight Zeid attacked one of our adventurers in the Northlands, and forced her to deliver a letter addressed to Captain Volker.
8889 : Even more unbelievable is the content of that letter...
8890 : But enough talking. We should enter the President's Office now.
8891 : What is the meaning of this!?
8892 : Give me one good reason why you were compelled to hide the truth about what my uncle did over thirty years ago!
8893 : Volker... We weren't trying to hide it from you...
8894 : Wait... You knew about this too?
8895 : Knew about...? Well...you see...
8896 : Oh, and the next thing you'll tell me is that % knew all about this as well!
8897 : So the only person who didn't know anything about it was the one with the cursed blood running through his veins! Me!
8898 : Is that all you've got, Raogrimm!?
8899 : Ulrich, why!?
8900 : Why? Because I never liked you, that's why!
8901 : You will never get away with this, Ulrich!
8902 : Watch me!
8903 : ...Cornelia!?
8904 : Wh-what have I done!?
8905 : I didn't join the Musketeers because of my uncle, but that didn't stop the rumors--the rumors that it was my uncle's influence that got me my position.
8906 : And so I was promoted to Mythril Musketeer, and then to captain...and what was waiting for me when I finally reached the top? The truth about my uncle and its cover-up! Who am I supposed to believe now!?
8907 : ...Are you done whining, Captain?
8908 : What...?
8909 : The only reason we did not inform you of what happened thirty years ago is because we thought you would react like this.
8910 : And look at yourself... Exactly what we expected. Or maybe you want us to sit with you and cry over your cursed destiny?
8911 : You want us to comfort you and tell you that what happened thirty years ago has nothing to do with the present? Will that make you feel better?
8912 : It seems that I have overestimated your ability as captain, Volker.
8913 : Karst! That wasn't necessary!
8914 : You are no longer of any worth to Bastok. Iron Eater will take your place until we appoint a new captain. Now leave this office.
8915 : President Karst!
8916 : And while you're gone, why don't you try finding Zeid and bringing him back to Bastok? He'd be a lot more useful around here than you.
8917 : Understood. I will obey your orders.
8918 : Captain!
8919 : It's all... It's all my fault. I should have told him a long time ago...
8920 : Hmph! If he couldn't handle that, then he certainly cannot handle the position of captain.
8921 : %! You heard what just transpired here. I have a feeling that Zeid's letter was just a ploy to get Volker to meet him.
8922 : However, by the looks of him, I'm not positive that Volker is ready to meet Zeid's challenge.
8923 : But we cannot wait for Volker to come to terms with the truth that lies before him. That's why I'm asking you to go capture the dark knight and bring him here.
8924 : Whether I make him Volker's replacement or throw him in jail is up to me.
8925 : President Karst! You cannot do this! Think of what both have done for this country!
8926 : That's right, Karst! You're not the type to let your feelings control your actions!
8927 : I've... I've given my orders and I'm not repeating myself.
8928 : Zeid has much popularity among our soldiers' ranks. And that is why I cannot allow this investigation to be headed up by the Musketeers.
8929 : %... You were successful in defeating the Shadow Lord. I'm entrusting this next task to you.
8930 : Now be off with you. Your destination is Castle Zvahl!
8931 : Welcome back from Castle Zvahl. You may enter.
8932 : Now that you're all here, I have just one question to ask... Why can't you Mythril Musketeers ever follow orders!?
8933 : I thought I told you to bring Zeid back here to Bastok!
8934 : And because you couldn't complete a simple task, what am I left to do? Reinstate this failure of a soldier as captain!?
8935 : President Karst...
8936 : I've heard enough. Leave my office. Find something suitable for the adventurer's reward.
8937 : Do you think the president's mad because of us?
8938 : You've got it backwards, Naji. I haven't seen him this happy in ages.
8939 : Ha ha. That man never could show his true feelings.
8940 : I thought that we might be punished more severely...
8941 : Oh, do not worry, sir. Knowing the president, I am sure we will be getting a pay cut, or something of the like.
8942 : A pay cut!? C'mon! I still have sixteen more payments on my loan...
8943 : Don't tell me you bought another sword...
8944 : I... I don't know how to thank all of you.
8945 : I can never be Zeid. I don't have the strength to carry the burdens that he does.
8946 : However, I have come to realize that there are some things that only I can accomplish.
8947 : While there are many truths that can be seen while within the boundaries of a nation, there are some things that can only be viewed once one has left their native soil.
8948 : That is why adventurers such as yourself are of great importance to our country.
8949 : This is your reward, %. And with it I present to you our nation's highest honor: rank 10.
8950 : I cannot begin to count the number of times I have thanked you for your services, but...thank you.
8951 : Some [guys/girls] have all the luck... You? You get a reward. Me? I get a pay cut!
8952 : Oh yeah, I almost forgot. There's a letter for you.
8953 : Here. You'll know who it's from when you read it.
8954 : Dear %, Do you really like Bastok?
8955 : I... I hated my country.
8956 : A country ruled by gil... A country where people don't care about anyone but themselves...
8957 : I tried to change it, but with each passing day, I came to think that maybe I really was powerless against the system.
8958 : But recently I've met a lot of different people, and I've come to realize that I'm not as powerless as I thought.
8959 : And that's why I've decided to listen to the voice of the people and ask them, Do you really like Bastok?
8960 : As a matter of fact, I've already started asking. Here's what they had to say...
8961 : You sure do ask the strangest things, Cornelia.
8962 : Hmmm, well... I haven't had the easiest life here in Bastok, but I don't think I could have pursued my dream anywhere else.
8963 : It may sound strange, but being in this country gives you the confidence to tell everybody, I'll show you!
8964 : Of course. I am proud to say that I was born and raised in Bastok.
8965 : Even though we are surrounded by malms of desert, I can still get all the ingredients I need for my family's meals.
8966 : I think that this can only come from the freedom that this nation is built on.
8967 : Some may criticize the money-hungry ways of the merchants and adventurers, but without them, where would Bastok be today?
8968 : My only trouble is trying to decide what to make for dinner. I'd say that is a fairly carefree life.
8969 : What the hell kind of question is that? How could I like a country where Humes have stepped on us Galka for hundreds of years!?
8970 : The bridge between our people cannot be built in a day. But if we do not try, the spirits of our ancestors can never rest.
8971 : Everyone knows we must change our ways, but that is often easier said than done.
8972 : Love, hate... Does it really matter?
8973 : But when people try to live their lives without taking the rules that have been laid down before them, there are bound to be some problems.
8974 : I guess that's what you call responsibility. You know, that word wasn't used that much by the ancient Galka.
8975 : Nobody really questioned the responsibility of the Talekeeper, just as no one really questions the responsibility of the gods.
8976 : If you are going to leave everything up to one person, responsibility is obsolete. However, if you try living in a community...
8977 : Now, if you, too, would start taking some responsibility...
8978 : Hey, you don't have to get that upset...!
8979 : If I had no feelings for this country, I would probably still be refining my skills in Norg...
8980 : But I feel that it is my duty to protect this nation. It may sound simple, but it is what drives me.
8981 : I just wanted a place where I could conduct my experiments...
8982 : I never thought they would make me so important. Ha ha.
8983 : The only thing I need out of life is the opportunity to give something back to the people...
8984 : Sure, I like Bastok. Where else could a guy like me become a Musketeer? This is the land of opportunity!
8985 : Now if they would just cut back my hours and give me a raise, I could be the star of hope for all the little children in the nation...
8986 : As long as the enemy lurks on the outside, the battle to defend this nation must continue. And as long as the battle continues, the work for officials such as myself will never end.
8987 : I do not think that we shall ever see a perfect Bastok, but that does not mean we should stop trying to build one.
8988 : The day one can speak their true feelings for one's country is the day [he/she] realizes [his/her] true role there.
8989 : With Sir Zeid away, I never stopped to think about what my role was...
8990 : But now I have finally come to see what I must do, and I feel a step closer to being able to speak my true feelings about Bastok.
8991 : Wh-what is that supposed to mean!? Now stop asking foolish questions and get back to your room and study!
8992 : I love this country from the bottom of my heart. Sharing the pain, and the joy...
8993 : Denying pain and forcing it on another can only cause more pain, and joy will never be achieved.
8994 : The pain that I have suffered is the pain of all the citizens of Bastok, and I will continue my struggle until that pain has turned to happiness.
8995 : As for me...well, I don't know if I can answer yet, but I do know this--there is a lot more of this country that I want to learn about.
8996 : And maybe someday I can become somebody who will represent the people and bring change to Bastok. Maybe I'll even become... Wait. I'll leave that a secret.
8997 : Just look at Captain Volker. Compared to his uncle, he's accomplished so much. If he could do it...
8998 : I apologize for my rambling. I want to thank you again for all you have done.
8999 : Fighting for our nation, defeating the Shadow Lord...your accomplishments have benefited Bastok so much.
9000 : However, in addition, you have given us something more important.
9001 : You have taught us about what we were lacking. I now know the importance of sharing our joy as well as our pain, and I will work hard to make sure I never forget.
9002 : Until we meet again, %...                        Cornelia
9003 : I have heard the rumors, %. People say that there are few who can match your great axe technique.
9004 : How would you like to challenge your limits? Here, take this axe and test yourself.
9005 : When you feel that the weapon can take you no further, bring it and this % back here to me.
9006 : Is something wrong? Are you giving up so easily?
9007 : What is wrong? Nothing. I've lost the axe. I've decided to give up.
9008 : And you call yourself an adventurer. You should learn to take better care of your property! Here, take this axe, and be more careful this time.
9009 : Give up? After coming this far?
9010 : Do you really want to give up? Yes. Not just yet.
9011 : I see you were not ready for the task I offered you... Do what you wish with that axe. I have no need for it.
9012 : Your journey is not yet over, %. There are still many roads that this axe has to lead you down.
9013 : So, the axe has finally recognized your true ability.
9014 : However, your journey is not yet over. Take this and travel to the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. There a great beast awaits you.
9015 : Defeat that beast and retrieve from it % as proof of your victory.
9016 : Hmph... Your eyes are asking me why you must do something so tedious.
9017 : I remember giving my master the same look when he asked me to perform this task many years ago. The answer to your question can only be realized by defeating that beast...
9018 : I see you have brought back the %...
9019 : Ten years ago, before I became a Mythril Musketeer, I, too, defeated the beast and brought back that same item as proof of my deed. Just as my master had ordered me...
9020 : Master, I do not feel that this axe is suited for me. I wish to continue my training in the way of the great sword.
9021 : Pagdako... Rushing into decisions can only hamper your potential.
9022 : That axe has shown you your limits, and has led you to reevaluate the paths you have chosen.
9023 : Whether or not you attempt to break those limits is up to you. Only you can decide which roads in life you will tread. This is all I can teach you...
9024 : Master!
9025 : Believe in yourself and your abilities, Pagdako. A new force is growing inside you as we speak...
9026 : I sensed that you, too, had begun to realize your limits. However, by fighting with that foe, a new force has begun to grow inside of you. These % are just a symbol of that force.
9027 : Step forth, and wield your axe with confidence, knowing that the path you have chosen has not ended. There is still much to learn...
9028 : You have learned the weapon skill Steel Cyclone!
9029 : Oh, %. You're just the person I wanted to see. I've heard a lot about your skill with firearms.
9030 : I want you to try out this new weapon we've invented. It's a mighty fine piece of work, if you ask me.
9031 : Oh, I almost forgot the owner's manual. Here it is...the %...? Who on Vana'diel gave it that name? Raibaht?
9032 : Well, he never did have that much in the way of imagination. Anyway, this lady's guaranteed to last until your grandchildren are clubbing Quadav. But if it ever stops shooting straight, bring it back to me. I'll fix her right up.
9033 : What's wrong? My weapon didn't backfire on you, did it?
9034 : Why are you here? No particular reason. I've lost the gun... I've had enough...
9035 : What do you mean, lost it? You know that guns are for shooting, not for throwing, right? Oh well. Take this as a replacement, but be more careful next time!
9036 : What are you talking about? We were just starting to get somewhere!
9037 : You don't really want to quit, do you? Yes, I do. No, not really.
9038 : Give up? Hey, it's not like I'm asking you to save the world or anything. <Sigh> Well, I can't force you to do anything you don't want to... But you get rid of the gun yourself, all right?
9039 : Wait a minute, this baby still has a few more rounds in her. Take her back to the battlefield and do some more damage, %.
9040 : So she's fired her last shot... I guess we'll have to work on improving this test model before we can start manufacturing.
9041 : Chief, that weapon is not a test model.
9042 : Not a test model? What do you mean, Raibaht? Come on, spill it.
9043 : I designed that gun to be used in training exercises.
9044 : Oh, you mean this is one of the guns we were asked to develop for... I'm sorry, %. I seem to have given you the wrong weapon.
9045 : While I say training exercises, you must know that I do not refer to the training of novices. In theory, only the top marksmen should be able to handle the power of that rifle. Which means...
9046 : Ha ha! This is perfect! We can shoot two birds with one bullet, so to speak.
9047 : %, I need you to go and find me %.
9048 : Maybe we can use that to help train our army's soldiers.
9049 : I've heard stories about it being hidden somewhere in the Boyahda Tree. You'll go get it for us, right?
9050 : You're back with the %! Here, let me take a look at her...
9051 : Hmmm... So that's what we've been missing...
9052 : When I was young, I used to be quite the marksman myself. However, too many hours in the lab has led me to forget all that I learned back then... I want to thank you for helping me to realize that, %. The least I can do is teach you the technique described in the %.
9053 : You have learned the weapon skill Detonator!
9054 : What're you doing in here?
9055 : Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. I'm waiting for someone.
9056 : I have come, as per our agreement.
9057 : Uh, now is not a good time. Can you come back later?
9058 : You were the one who called me here, were you not?
9059 : You're... Viresefilant...?
9060 : Ayame? Long has it been since our paths last crossed. You are now a Mythril Musketeer, if I'm not mistaken?
9061 : I was fortunate, that is all.
9062 : There is no need to rub my nose in it, Ayame.
9063 : That's not what I--
9064 : Out of my way. I have better things to do.
9065 : You know that guy?
9066 : Yes... We trained together in Norg.
9067 : We promised to always lend each other strength when the path became too hard to travel.
9068 : I thought he would've been glad to see I had become a Mythril Musketeer...
9069 : Well, people change. Maybe he just forgot about those times. You shouldn't beat yourself up over it.
9070 : Anyway, what can I do for you? I'm kinda busy over here...
9071 : In that case, it can wait. We'll speak later.
9072 : Adventurer, I need to have a word with you. Could you come to the Northern Cannonry?
9073 : I apologize for all the mystery...
9074 : ...but I needed to speak with you in private.
9075 : You see...
9076 : I have a request for you from a senator.
9077 : He claims to have been receiving threats.
9078 : Every day there have been mountains of incoherent, slanderous letters arriving at the President's Office. So many, in fact, the herald delivering these threats, rather than the senator himself, has collapsed from the strain.
9079 : Now we have Naji delivering the mail, if you can imagine it.
9080 : This interruption to our duties, not to mention Naji's complaining, has become intolerable. So I did some investigating. From the letters, I was able to discover the identity of the writer and negotiate a meeting at the Tenshodo here in Bastok. However...
9081 : There is one small problem. The letter writer won't meet with anyone unless they bring a certain diary.
9082 : This diary is supposedly hidden somewhere within the Palborough Mines. I have no idea why it would be there.
9083 : The Mythril Musketeers are far too busy with more pressing matters to conduct a search of the mines, and we certainly can't expect the senator to go in our stead.
9084 : This is where you come in. Would you be willing to take this task upon yourself?
9085 : Will you perform this task? Sure, the mines are like my second home. I also have more pressing matters...
9086 : I cannot entrust this task to anyone else. Please let me know if you change your mind.
9087 : This is not only about the diary. You will also be required to eliminate the letter writer. I am sure your skills in combat will be tested before this matter has been put to rest.
9088 : Show the diary to Kagetora, and he will tell you where the author of these threatening letters can be found. I leave the negotiations to your discretion.
9089 : Ah, yes. Please do not mention any of this to Romualdo.
9090 : Senator Alois has his suspicions.
9091 : Apparently Romualdo has been seen in the company of some strange character as of late.
9092 : But putting aside these speculations, there is reason to believe that someone has been providing the letter writer with information.
9093 : It is unlikely that the writer is in direct contact with an employee of the President's Office, so I assume there must be a messenger of some sort.
9094 : I want you to find out the identity of this messenger as well.
9095 : Viresefilant...? What is going on here? I must speak with Senator Alois...
9096 : What business does an adventurer have with me?
9097 : Is that so? How strange, I have no memory of making any such request. The next time you see Ayame, you tell her to keep my name out of her affairs.
9098 : Senator Alois, forgive this interruption, but there is something I need to spe--
9099 : Can't I get any peace around here?
9100 : Please explain to me about this new assassin group.
9101 : Assassa-whatsits? What in Vana'diel are you babbling about?
9102 : Save the act, Senator. Kagetora of the Tenshodo told me everything.
9103 : Creating this fictitious assassin organization to lure adventurers into doing your dirty work is an abuse of power.
9104 : I did no such thing. I just mentioned the rumor that an assassin group might exist. It's not my fault if they took things the wrong way.
9105 : What are you trying to say exactly? That I have to take responsibility for other people's misunderstandings now, hmmm?
9106 : I am already in a position of responsibility.
9107 : I have eliminated the objective as per your orders, Senator.
9108 : ...!!!
9109 : Ah! Good work, good work. You have carried out my request to shut up that big-mou...I mean, remove that menace to our nation most admirably.
9110 : From now on, please inform me in advance when you intend to make a report.
9111 : Does this mean I have been accepted into the assassins?
9112 : There must be some sort of mistake.
9113 : I don't know anything about any assassins.
9114 : What makes you think that I would be able to authorize something like that in the first place? I believe you've taken some of my previous comments in entirely the wrong light. In the future, pay a little more attention to the details.
9115 : And did you find out who the messenger was? I specifically ordered you to discover who was running the information back and forth.
9116 : You expect to receive a reward when you haven't even completed your assignment? I have no patience for this kind of unprofessionalism. Get back out there at once!
9117 : If you have any complaints, kindly make them after you have brought me the messenger!
9118 : Senator!
9119 : Guards! There is an unwelcome guest in the President's Office. Remove him immediately.
9120 : ...
9121 : Honestly, the number of ill-mannered hireswords these days just makes my head ache.  Are you still here? Be on your way, adventurer.
9122 : What is the meaning of this, Senator? That exchange appeared to be more than just a simple misunderstanding. You promised him a position as an assassin, didn't you?
9123 : Your actions in this matter are reprehensible. You enlisted his services because of his exceptional skill, correct?
9124 : That level of ability is not something gained over a weekend training session. Do you have any idea of the sweat and tears one must go through to attain such perfection!?
9125 : What is that to me?
9126 : Well, I know exactly what he has gone through. The toil and the blisters of constant practice. Swinging a katana until his arm was numb from the strain. Encouraging others to push on, even though he himself was ready to drop.
9127 : Even if I don't know everything about him, I know that much. You will apologize for manipulating him and making a mockery of his effort.
9128 : ...
9129 : Senator...
9130 : Huh...?
9131 : I've had about enough of your lecturing. If you're done whining, I'm sure you have other duties to attend to. Now get out!
9132 : If that is the way it must be. I'll take my leave.
9133 : %, would you accompany me, please?
9134 : I suppose you're thinking of crying to the president about this? What a pity he's far too busy to make time for the likes of you.
9135 : I am a patient woman...
9136 : Guards! This adventurer is to be banned from entering the Metalworks, effective immediately!
9137 : Your methods lack subtlety.
9138 : Who asked for your opinion!? Get out!
9139 : Senator Alois, could you spare a moment?
9140 : Who is this man?
9141 : This is the messenger you've been searching for.
9142 : Please forgive me. I was the one who tricked Romualdo into revealing sensitive information about you, sir.
9143 : Seems he was ready to sell information to other citizens who hold grudges against you as well. We were lucky this business was restricted to just one malcontent.
9144 : Unbelievable. Well then, lad, excellent work. I'll be able to sleep much easier tonight.
9145 : That's the kind of efficiency I've come to expect from the Mythril Musketeers.
9146 : Actually, it wasn't me who caught him, sir. It was the man you ordered me to remove from the office a little while ago.
9147 : Sir, you did mention you would hear what he had to say if he brought you the messenger. You really should listen to him.
9148 : The thing is, though, he's already left the Republic. Fed up with the treatment he's received, I'd imagine. So I'll do his talking for him.
9149 : There was only one thing he wished to say to you.
9150 : Be ashamed of your actions.
9151 : How dare a simple citizen speak that way to a senator!
9152 : We-ell... I suppose it's about time I took this fellow before the president and had him confess to his crimes. You don't mind, do you? After all, it is my duty.
9153 : President Karst is so intimidating... I'd just break down and tell him everything.
9154 : I...
9155 : ...All right. I will never do anything like this again. I swear it.
9156 : Ayame, got a minute?
9157 : There was one more message I had to deliver.
9158 : From Viresefilant?
9159 : The promise you both made that day... He kept that promise to look out for you.
9160 : He remembered...
9161 : Okay, time for me to go. I'm no good at this sappy stuff.
9162 : I owe my thanks to you as well. Please take this with my gratitude.
9163 : May fortune smile upon your future endeavors, %.
9164 : Good day, [sir/ma'am]. I am with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (AMAN) and am now taking applications for new mentors.
9165 : What is a mentor, you ask? Well, in short, a mentor is an experienced adventurer who is willing to offer some of their time to help out their less traveled companions.
9166 : If this sounds like the job for you, then feel free to sign up today.
9167 : To become a mentor, you must have completed the Records of Eminence objective %.
9168 : Accepting % requires that you have over 180 hours of play time...
9169 : ...and have completed the Records of Eminence objective %.
9170 : Please note that registering and serving as a mentor, as well as utilizing the services of the Mentor Program, are to be done at the player's own discretion.
9171 : SQUARE ENIX will not be held responsible for the actions and/or comments of any mentors. No benefits of any kind will be provided to those who choose to participate in the Mentor Program.
9172 : When you agree to participate in the Mentor Program, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood the above terms.
9173 : I am sorry, but you do not meet the requirements necessary to accept the Records of Eminence objective %.
9174 : Please speak to me again once you have accepted %. I will then judge whether or not you meet the requirements.
9175 : You have accepted %, yes? Then let me check my materials here...
9176 : Congratulations! You are qualified to be a mentor!
9177 : My materials here say that you don't meet the requirements. Keep at it!
9178 : Would you like to serve as a mentor? Yes. No.
9179 : You are now a registered mentor.
9180 : You can enable "Mentor Status" by using the command /mentor on. You can disable the status by using /mentor off.
9181 : Mentor status can also be switched on and off in the Config menu found within the Help Desk.
9182 : You are already a registered mentor.
9183 : new objective, %, has been added to Records of Eminence.
9184 : %! So you, too, have decided to join the Bastokan forces and participate in Conflict!
9185 : Ha ha! Do not tell me you are worried about those cowards to the east or those arrogant fools to the north. They will be no match for the strength of our nation. Now let us go and report to the president.
9186 : Sir! I have with me an adventurer who wishes to participate in...
9187 : What in Altana's name was that Volker thinking!? Agreeing to the reinstatement of Conflict... Why am I forced to work with complete idiots!?
9188 : Sir, Captain Volker was only thinking of the Republican Army when he made his decision. Conflict would give our forces a boost in morale, as well as sharpen their skills.
9189 : And I'm saying that his way of thinking is flawed and outdated! Why waste our funds on children's games when that gil could be used to develop new weapons!
9190 : Sir, are you saying that our country would not profit from Conflict...?
9191 : And what would a Mythril Musketeer know about profit!? That profit is what fills your cupboards with brown bread and rocksalt.
9192 : Don't you tell me how to run my country!  It is my job to decide what will and will not benefit this nation.
9193 : Listen up, because I'm only going to say this once. Conflict is nothing but a series of war games. We are not allowed to even test our new ships or cannons.
9194 : No! The exercises must be won with well-planned tactics. In the field of battle tactics, there isn't a nation in all of Vana'diel that can outmatch our generals. There is no reason for us to have to prove that.
9195 : San d'Oria? Hah! Let them line up in their little lines and charge with their wooden spears.
9196 : Don't forget that it wasn't only our cannons that delivered them defeat during the Battle of Konschtat.
9197 : And Windurst? Hah! Those cowards don't even know how to fight! Hiding behind hired mercenaries, muttering spells doesn't win campaigns.
9198 : It didn't work in Elshimo and it won't work this time, either! They should all just crawl up in their big tree and hibernate for the winter.
9199 : The ages of strength and magic are over.
9200 : San d'Oria and Windurst have the tools they need to win, but they don't have the brains to use them! Our citizens do. And that's why we will always be victorious!
9201 : Sir, this adventurer...
9202 : You want my approval to fight in Conflict, citizen? You have it! Dismissed!
9203 : I apologize for the president's behavior. While he is vocal in his opposition to Bastok's participation in Conflict, the last thing he wishes is the Republic's defeat.
9204 : Hmmm... So, you are here from [San d'Oria/Windurst] to receive permission to participate in Conflict?
9205 : ...
9206 : ... I apologize if I look shocked, but I expected more from [the once mighty lions of San d'Oria/the once mighty magicians of the Federation]...
9207 : Well, no matter. Follow me. We must not keep the president waiting.
9208 : Sir! I have with me an adventurer who wishes to participate in...
9209 : I have a question for you, [young man/young lady]. Why did you pledge your allegiance to [San d'Oria/Windurst] and not to Bastok?
9210 : You chose [San d'Oria/Windurst] because of... ...its people. ...its culture. ...its city. ...its leader.
9211 : Its people? The helpless masses whining for a hero to hold their hands when things get tough? The petty common folk, blind to their own worthlessness? Did you really think that you could be their hero?
9212 : San d'Oria's culture? You mean their stubborn pride? Or perhaps the blatant ostentation found in their castles and cathedrals? But, tell me. Can a well-decorated chateau feed the hungry masses!?
9213 : Windurst's culture? Yes, magic is good for talent shows and birthday parties, but can an incantation feed your nation's starving people!?
9214 : Its city? Have you spent even a second to think of what the people of your nation had to give to build that city for its leaders? Years of sweat and blood...and for what? Can a fancy bridge or beautiful fountain feed the hungry masses!?
9215 : San d'Oria's leader? You don't mean that decrepit old man who spends his days snoring on the throne, do you? Or maybe you meant those bickering brothers? Yes, all of them make wonderful leaders.
9216 : Windurst's leader? Yes, I'd love to be Windurst's leader. All I'd have to do all day is hide up in my treehouse and have my maids take out the garbage.
9217 : Oh, but don't let me tell you what is right or just.
9218 : All you have to remember is that the wheels of change began turning back during the [Battle of Konschtat/Elshimo Campaign].
9219 : You have my permission to participate in Conflict, but don't forget that a new age is upon us, and Bastok is at the reigns.
9220 : Of course, there's always the option of naturalization. The officers at the Department of Industry would be more than delighted to take your application. You're dismissed!
9221 : What is wrong? Were you offended by what the president had to say? Well, I can offer you no apologies. According to my sources, your nation's leaders are just as vocal with their opinions of the Republic. If you have any complaints, I suggest you settle them on the battlefield.
9222 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
9223 : You hear a voice from out of nowhere...
9224 : You obtain # %!
9225 : ... At last we meet.
9226 : I have been freed from my prison and can soak up the sweat and blood of this world once more.
9227 : Wait, there is something I must...
9228 : This place is...?
9229 : I see... You must be the new wielder for these.
9230 : Yes, with your fighting spirit I believe you will be able to master the %.
9231 : The % have long accompanied me, along both rough and gentle paths. It is not easy to give them up, but...here.
9232 : They belong to you now. I ask that you consider my... Ah, but that is past now. I bid you farewell....
9233 : ...
9234 : I hope you don't think this is the end.
9235 : Your real life as a martial artist is just beginning. Time to start your training anew!
9236 : ... Finally! We finally meet face to face!
9237 : I have a presence in this world again! What an exhilarating feeling!
9238 : Ah yes, there is one more thing...
9239 : Eh? What?
9240 : Oh. You must be this one's new owner.
9241 : With your dagger skills, you'll make a perfect wielder for the %.
9242 : It is most difficult to give up a weapon that has seen me through so many tight spots, but you have earned it.
9243 : Treat her well...
9244 : ...
9245 : Splendid! From this day forth, I belong to you.
9246 : So, what kind of games shall we play? And where shall we go to play them? Who are we going to kill when we get there? It's all just too exciting...!
9247 : ... Thou hast found me.
9248 : I have now thrice shown my true form in this world.
9249 : A moment...
9250 : ... What has happened to me?
9251 : I see, you are the sword's new owner?
9252 : Well, this is most encouraging! A master of swordplay such as yourself should have no trouble wielding %.
9253 : When the world lies in chaos, this blade appears before the one meant to wield it. It is yours... Restore order to Vana'diel!
9254 : And now I, too, can rest unburdened...
9255 : ...
9256 : Thou art blessed this day.
9257 : Henceforth, I shall be thy blade. For the sake of thy companions, for justice in this world, wield my power in the name of honor...
9258 : ... You have found me.
9259 : Allow me to show my respect. You who have gained the strength of so many must be a true hero.
9260 : But first...
9261 : Who are you?
9262 : This must be some sort of joke. You are the new wielder of this weapon?
9263 : Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you. With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.
9264 : However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.
9265 : Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind. My regards go with you, stranger...
9266 : ...
9267 : Now, my heroic master...
9268 : For what purpose will you wield my power? The choices before you are without limit. Will you become the ruler of this world? Or perhaps...
9269 : ... You...me, meet.
9270 : Me...free... Thanks to you. Me, your...
9271 : Wait...
9272 : What the...?
9273 : Ah, now I see. The wheel has turned.
9274 : Truthfully spoken, I am thankful. % is a splendid axe, but ever does it hunger.
9275 : I have taken many lives to sate its need, and have reached the end of my strength.
9276 : You have my gratitude. You have freed me from my nightmare, and now I can sleep with a tranquil spirit...
9277 : ...
9278 : You, master, me. Good, work. Me, thank, you.
9279 : Master, me, hunger. Go, hunt? Find, prey? Me, cut, flesh. Break, bone. Drink, blood. Master, me, hunger...
9280 : ... Ah, you found me!
9281 : I have been freed from a world where life and death, reality and illusion are impossible to tell apart. I am truly grateful.
9282 : One moment...
9283 : ... This is...Jeuno!? Have I finally returned?
9284 : I... Nobody can see me. This is merely a reflection of reality. Which means you are the one to inherit the axe.
9285 : Hmm. With your polished skills, you will make a fine master for %.
9286 : The one who wields this axe must also be beautiful to look upon. Apparently, I was a suitable candidate. Do you not agree?
9287 : Congratulations. I expect you to perform great deeds from this day onwards. I also ask that someday you use % to avenge the Hydra Corps...
9288 : ...
9289 : I congratulate you also...my new master.
9290 : Now hold me high and let my blade glint in the sunlight! Let your friends, as well as your enemies, feast upon my glorious beauty!
9291 : ... You have found me.
9292 : My forbidden power is now yours, and I am liberated from my prison.
9293 : You have but to gain her respect...
9294 : Such a long dream I was having...
9295 : It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world. No. I must accept that it was no dream.
9296 : And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did... It seems you have already found your way to %.
9297 : Very well, I will pass it on to you. But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.
9298 : And think long and hard on whether or not this power should be used. Do not end up like me...
9299 : ...
9300 : Heh. Heh heh. Hahahahahahaha!
9301 : Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power? There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...
9302 : ... You have unearthed me at last.
9303 : I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.
9304 : All that remains is...
9305 : Hello? Is it possible that I...
9306 : But, no. I have not returned to this realm... You. You are to be my successor?
9307 : You certainly seem to have the required skill with the lance. Enough to convince % to lend you its power, at any rate.
9308 : Having this spear on the battlefield makes you a match for almost any opponent.
9309 : Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used. You have my admiration, adventurer. You have done well...
9310 : ...
9311 : The ceremony of inheritance is complete.
9312 : It is time for you to go forth and experience my overwhelming strength...
9313 : ... I have been rediscovered at last.
9314 : Thanks to you, I have made my escape from the shrouded land.
9315 : You must now gain the sanction of my master...
9316 : It is a pity, indeed.
9317 : This day has come far too soon for my liking.
9318 : However, you are a master of the ninja trade. I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the %.
9319 : Take this blade as your own. Travel far down the path of the ninja.
9320 : I will be watching you from the shadows...
9321 : ...
9322 : A fine master...
9323 : My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...
9324 : ... This day has finally come.
9325 : I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age. Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?
9326 : In any event...
9327 : What is going on here?
9328 : Ah, my successor has come.
9329 : I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the % and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.
9330 : When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.
9331 : You have my gratitude. Farewell, %...
9332 : ...
9333 : It has been a hard path to reach this point.
9334 : But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun. You have yet to attain perfection. Let us continue your training...
9335 : ... At long last, you have arrived.
9336 : I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...
9337 : You have proven me wrong...
9338 : I have heard of your coming.
9339 : You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?
9340 : Every time % is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor. I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.
9341 : However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now.  If you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.
9342 : Now, take the hammer and go! Just be careful with how you handle it. Do not let its might crush you as well...
9343 : ...
9344 : My might is yours to wield.
9345 : Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...
9346 : ... So, you have found me.
9347 : I must give you my thanks. I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.
9348 : And now...
9349 : Hwaah!
9350 : Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.
9351 : Well, it's for the best, I suppose. In my current state, % is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.
9352 : I entrust this staff to you! Take up %, %, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!
9353 : I take my leave of you now. I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...
9354 : ...
9355 : I am yours to wield.
9356 : But you are not yet my master. By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...
9357 : ... You have discovered my resting place.
9358 : The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more. My thanks.
9359 : Ah, one more test of your patience...
9360 : Where is this place?
9361 : Of course. How could I forget. I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.
9362 : Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary. % will fit snugly into your sure grasp.
9363 : However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke. You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.
9364 : Farewell...
9365 : ...
9366 : It is an honor to be owned by a just master. Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.
9367 : You are now the one to draw me in battle. I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.
9368 : ... We finally meet.
9369 : I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.
9370 : But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...
9371 : Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep. Oh, this place looks familiar...
9372 : Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?
9373 : You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And % would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...
9374 : Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.
9375 : This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...
9376 : ...
9377 : A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.
9378 : Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...
9379 : ... I am saved.
9380 : Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!
9381 : A few more moments, if you please...
9382 : Hello there. I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.
9383 : You've never heard of me? Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.
9384 : To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the %, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.
9385 : But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.
9386 : She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...
9387 : ...
9388 : He was a wonderful performer.
9389 : Let us be on our way. Our tour of the world has only just begun...

9439 : First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of Flammen-Brenner.
9440 : At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with Flamme, or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
9441 : Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
9442 : The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
9443 : The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
9444 : If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The match score section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
9445 : Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
9446 : You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
9447 : No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
9448 : The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed # members, or if there are fewer than # members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
9449 : Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
9450 : LS Liga is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
9451 : A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
9452 : The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
9453 : If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
9454 : After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
9455 : Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
9456 : In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
9457 : Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
9458 : Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
9459 : However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
9460 : Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
9461 : Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
9462 : The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
9463 : In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
9464 : In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
9465 : I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
9466 : Well, that was exciting... Hm? You're looking for that rude and crude little girl?
9467 : Well, why didn't you say so!? We thought she might go causing trouble, so...
9468 : So we threw the vagrant into one of our holding cells.
9469 : Lady Cornelia has been keeping the girl company. Master Cid, have you sustained any injuries?
9470 : I'm fine. I'm fine. But it's our little guest that I'm worried about. She seems pretty confused and upset. I was going to let her rest a while before I tried talking to her.
9471 : Oh, don't worry. She hasn't done anything wrong, and there are no plans of punishing her any further.
9472 : She'll be let go once we've sorted a few things out... Do you know what she was yelling about earlier?
9473 : All this nonsense about airships and Wyrmkings... I couldn't make heads or tails of it...
9474 : What!? Armored airships? Hooded scientists?
9475 : Well... The scientists are probably the ones from Jeuno. As for the airships, all I can think is that they might be the ones modified for battle during the Great War. But that project was canceled after the allied forces defeated the Shadow Lord's armies.
9476 : I know because I was a member of the project!
9477 : Twenty years ago, I get this invitation from the duke himself to work on a secret project for the Duchy. Minus myself and a few other scientists from Windurst, all the rest of the people assigned to the project are these creepy, pale-faced men in dark, hooded robes.
9478 : They rarely showed their faces in public, but from what I saw, the knowledge and technology they possessed was far superior to anything I had ever seen anywhere on Vana'diel.
9479 : Why, the crystal propulsion unit that they had developed was years ahead of its time.
9480 : But it required an energy source more powerful than that which the eight elemental crystals found on Vana'diel could provide.
9481 : What were the Jeunoan scientists using to power their unit, and where did they discover that power?
9482 : I was determined to find out, so I started watching them every chance I got.
9483 : It wasn't long before I noticed that they were conducting a lot of strange experiments around the Crag of [Holla/Dem/Mea], but I couldn't put my finger on exactly what they were doing...
9484 : And now they've restarted the project! But why are they sending the airships to Tavnazia...?
9485 : To catch Bahamut, that's why!
9486 : !?
9487 : Cid, this is Prishe. She's feeling much better than she was before. I think she's ready to talk.
9488 : Thanks, Cornelia. So, Prishe. First, let me apologize for keeping you locked up for so long. No hard feelings, alright? But I need you to tell me, who is this Bahamut you keep talking about?
9489 : Oh, you mean the Wyrmking. Well, everything was all fine and dandy until one day, all of a sudden, this huge dragon appears over my hometown.
9490 : We were going to meet this dragon and try to knock some sense into him when out of nowhere, a huge airship contraption with all these guns and cannons flies up.
9491 : We were right in the middle of giving the guys from that ship a sound beating until poof, I'm warped to this hellhole.
9492 : What!? You were actually fighting against the Duchy?
9493 : Hey, we weren't just going to sit there and let them kill Bahamut! Anyway, it was Jeuno who took the first shots.
9494 : If I only had a little more time, I could have found out what the Wyrmking meant when he was talking about the Keeper of the Apocalypse...
9495 : Keeper of the Apocalypse... I've heard that name somewhere before...
9496 : Hmmm... I'm not sure what it is exactly, but I can sense that something big is going down.
9497 : At the same time that the Telepoint at Dem shattered, I heard a report of a giant dragon appearing over the sea north of Jeuno.
9498 : If that dragon was actually Bahamut, then we can conclude that the two events are in some way connected.
9499 : Then that's all the more reason to get back to Riverne and try meeting with the Wyrmking one more time! C'mon, let's head for Jeuno!
9500 : Jeuno? After all that's happened, why would you want to go there?
9501 : I've got an old friend who works at the Tenshodo. If I ask him, he'll be more than happy to ready a boat back to Tavnazia.
9502 : Well, I'll be seeing you guys around! Thanks for all the hospitality!
9503 : Hey, wait! How do you plan on traveling to Jeuno? Do you even know how far it is!?
9504 : Bahamut... Tavnazia...
9505 : My ears still doubt the conversation I just heard. Could it all be true?
9506 : I guess the only way to find out would be to tag along with that Prishe a little while longer. She said she was going to Jeuno to meet a friend... Who do you suppose she knows in the Duchy?
9507 : The Multinational Expedition? Yeah, I remember reading about that in grade school, but if you want details, you'll have to ask someone a little bit older.
9508 : Chief Cid's pretty old... Uh-oh... You don't go telling him I said that, okay?
9509 : You will find there are not many people who are willing to speak of the Multinational Expedition.
9510 : Especially among us Galka...
9511 : What, you want to hear about the Multinational Expedition?
9512 : What is there to know? Everybody that went on that damned mission passed away or was...
9513 : I usually don't believe in anything crazy like magic or curses, but after hearing the stories about what happened up there in the Northlands, I don't think there may be any other explanation.
9514 : You already heard from the other two nations that the expedition was formed on the suggestion of the Republic, right?
9515 : <Sigh> Maybe it's time that I face up to my past crimes... I was the one that pressured the government into sending a party to the Northlands.
9516 : Thirty years ago, a man brought a strange stone to the Metalworks.
9517 : It wasn't any bigger than my fist, but just by standing near it you could feel the power flowing from its facets.
9518 : That power was greater than that of any crystal I had ever seen. I was shocked and amazed by what lay before my eyes.
9519 : When the man told me that it was a fragment of a crystal that was found in the Northlands, I was convinced that something more was hiding up there.
9520 : I thought if I could find that energy source and bring it back to Bastok, the Republic would thrive, ultimately becoming the strongest, most advanced nation in the world.
9521 : So I told my discovery to the president at the time, and suggested that he ready an expedition led by a party of musketeers.
9522 : It was supposed to be top-secret, but somehow the information leaked to the other two nations, and...
9523 : And in the end, the expedition turned up nothing, and we lost more than we could ever have imagined...
9524 : Now that I think of it, the energy from that stone might have been enough to power the crystal propulsion unit.
9525 : Could Jeuno have already found a new source of energy in the Northlands?
9526 : If I only had that rock... Unfortunately, it disappeared thirty years ago...right around the time of the expedition.
9527 : The man who sold me the stone--a stone which he called magicite--said that he brought it from Tavnazia, and that it was a piece of a larger gem known as the Star of Tavnazia.
9528 : Maybe that crazy blue-haired girl from the island knows something about that gem.
9529 : Do you think you could ask her for me?
9530 : So you have a piece of the magicite as well...
9531 : It looks similar to the one I saw before, but I don't feel the same kind of power flowing from it.
9532 : No, the one I saw was pitch-black and so powerful that you could feel its energy from over twenty yalms away.
9533 : The Multinational Expedition held thirty years ago all started when a shard of the fabled Star of Tavnazia was brought to the Republic.
9534 : It was rumored that the gem was originally found in the Northlands, and that is why the party headed there first.
9535 : If you ask one of your Tavnazian friends about the star, you might be able to learn something interesting.
9536 : Oh, %. What are you doing here?
9537 : I heard that you went back to Tavnazia. Did you already meet up with Louverance?
9538 : %! How did you get off the island!?
9539 : Ah! It's Cid!
9540 : Prishe? Do you know this man?
9541 : ...
9542 : Master Cid. We were able to return earlier than first planned.
9543 : I must thank you again for allowing us to borrow such a wonderful bird. The airship has been handed over to the good men at the port.
9544 : So, how did my [/Ultra /Hyper /Psycho /Eternal /Neo /Lovely /Pretty /Final /Extra /Deadly /Savage /Aero /Pseudo /Universal /Exciting /Celestial /Super /Mighty /Mega /Omni /Poly ][/Terror /Perfect /Royale /Gorgeous /Pretty /Hell /Fantasy /Stealth /Powerful /Invincible /Explosive /Storm /Fantastic /Duper /Go-Go /Morphing /Retro /Sonic /Cloud /Sky /Stellar ][/Hyper /Neo /Lovely /Happy /Caller /Hound /XI /Armored /Brutal /Buster /Alpha /Chief /Provoker /Mincer /Streak /King /Prince /Power /Robo /Delver /Mystic ][C.I.D./Enterprise/Nautilus/Gilgamemnon/Redwing/Blackjack/Falcon/Highwind/Ragnarok/Hilda Garde/Prima Vista/Red Rose/Fahrenheit] fly? Bet the ride was smooth as silk and soft as Saruta cotton.
9545 : There are still a few stability problems that need to be stomped out, but her speed is far superior to that of the ships in the armada.
9546 : Quite superior indeed. It was a wonderful experience.
9547 : But this adventure in the skies reminded me of how I am incessantly plagued with terrible luck. If I only had the good fortune of meeting with you sooner, Master Cid...
9548 : Ha ha ha! You've got it wrong there, Louverance. You were lucky to meet me when you did.
9549 : If you had come along any earlier, I wouldn't have been able to help you.

9550 : Why, you're the first to ever experience her turbo engines!
9551 : The first...?
9552 : So, did you all find this Cardinal Mildaurion you were looking for in Tavnazia?
9553 : Unfortunately, no. The cardinal has not been back to the archipelago...
9554 : I was able to retrieve valuable information on her past from these two young ladies, but I am no closer to grasping her whereabouts.
9555 : Hmm... That's not good... What about the magicite? Were you able to find out anything for me?
9556 : Actually, I did learn something very intriguing. However...this is not a good place...
9557 : Did you say magicite?
9558 : You heard me right. %, you said you were looking for some, too, right?
9559 : I was hoping that you could join me when Louverance tells his story about Tavnazia's magicite.
9560 : But first, why don't you tell everybody what we know about the energy source in the Northlands?
9561 : Tell them what you know? Yes. No.
9562 : %! We will not take no for an answer!
9563 : I see... So you have been following the advice of Esha'ntarl, traveling to the three nations of San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst to gather information on the Multinational Expedition.
9564 : If we can discover where the Tavnazian magicite brought to Bastok originated, then we will discover the final destination of our journey!
9565 : True, but after I told % what I knew about the dark gem, I did a little more research on my own. When I asked an old friend about the subject, he told me something quite interesting.
9566 : My magicite wasn't found lying around in the Northlands, but inside a strange relic that was brought back from the Northlands.
9567 : A strange relic?
9568 : Yes, some kind of strange box.
9569 : According to the priests of Tavnazia, the ancients made the box from some unidentifiable metal--just like the kind used in the Crag of Dem.
9570 : That sounds like...the baptismal vessel...
9571 : Baptismal vessel? Prishe, do you know something about this box?
9572 : Of course. The Tavnazian theologians used that box when performing the baptism ceremony.
9573 : It should still be in the Sacrarium's tabernacle. I'd know because I'm the only one who has a key to that place. I've been protecting the key ever since before the Great War--on Miss Mildaurion's orders!
9574 : The baptism ceremony...? Then Prishe's accident was...?
9575 : Yes, why didn't I see it before? Even though you were deemed the abhorrent one, you still took part in the theologians' baptism!
9576 : Then let me tell you this. While in Tavnazia, I attempted to investigate the baptismal vessel for Master Cid.
9577 : However, I was forced to abandon my investigation before I even began. Just days before I arrived, an officer of the Duchy, Nag'molada, broke into the Sacrarium and stole the relic.
9578 : The vessel was stolen!?
9579 : It's those hooded bastards from Jeuno! They must have learned that I was searching for the origins of the black magicite, and stole the box so I couldn't get my hands on it!
9580 : I was so close! Now I'll never learn its secrets!
9581 : Wait a minute... Prishe, you said you knew about the box. What can you tell us? Even the smallest bit of info could help.
9582 : The vessel's evil. It changed my life. Dragged me to hell and back...
9583 : Prishe?
9584 : We have to get the vessel out of Nag'molada's hands! It belongs in Tavnazia!
9585 : Prishe! Wait!
9586 : Prishe! You cannot keep going off on your own! It is too dangerous!
9587 : %, you mentioned that you and Tenzen had made arrangements to meet Nag'molada in the northwestern tower of Pso'Xja.
9588 : A great energy in the Northlands... While not necessarily relevant to my current mission, I am intrigued...on a personal level...
9589 : I will be waiting for you in Beaucedine, %!
9590 : Well, this doesn't look good now, does it? %, you should probably try to catch up with your companions ASAP.
9591 : Me? I'll keep trying to find out more on the magicite. I've still got a few cards up my sleeve.
9592 : This baptismal vessel... Now, if I could get my hands on that, just think of the advancements the Republic could make...
9593 : %! You need to hurry to the northwestern tower of Pso'Xja. I'll stay here and keep trying to find out more on the magicite. I've still got a few cards up my sleeve.
9594 : %! I was starting to worry about you! Are you all right?
9595 : I heard from Louverance that you weren't able to get the box back, but at least you're in one piece. Somebody up there is smiling down on you, that's for sure.
9596 : Master Cid... Ah, and [Sir/Lady] %.
9597 : I commend you adventurers on your efficient methods of transportation.
9598 : After our ordeal, Tenzen and Ulmia made it back safe to San d'Oria.
9599 : However, there are still no signs of Prishe...
9600 : We can only pray that she was as resourceful as % here in escaping from the glacier.
9601 : Well, I have some bad news for you... A communications has just been sent out to all three nations from Jeuno... Prishe is wanted on criminal charges. The Duchy has issued a warrant for her immediate arrest.
9602 : That is preposterous!
9603 : When Prishe sang her song, Selh'teus was able to escape... Nag'molada believes that Prishe and the boy are working together!
9604 : Prishe's song... The fourth verse of the Memoria de la S^tona... But where did she learn it?
9605 : I do not know... But one thing is for certain: We must find Prishe before Jeuno does!
9606 : We then can ask her of the song and of the Keeper of the Apocalypse...
9607 : Yes, and of Bahamut. What was she trying to tell us...?
9608 : How to break the pact with the Wyrmking...? How to remonstrate against his actions...?
9609 : The pact... When the Keeper of the Apocalypse arrives, Bahamut shall destroy mankind...
9610 : Destroy mankind!? You mean to tell me the conqueror of the skies, Bahamut, is planning a mass genocide?
9611 : Unfortunately, yes. And as far as we know, the Keeper of the Apocalypse has already arrived...in the form of the boy Selh'teus.
9612 : Sent by the ancients from the celestial capital of Al'Taieu, Selh'teus's coming is foretold in mankind's pact with Bahamut--and that is why Bahamut, too, has awoken.
9613 : And now the Wyrmking has begun calling upon his slumbering minions--he is forming an army to fulfill the pact.
9614 : We traveled to the den of the terrestrial avatar. However, he would not listen to our pleas.
9615 : His heart is stained with anger and there is no way to cleanse it.
9616 : That is why the only option left before us is to somehow break the pact... But how...?
9617 : Break the pact... Hmmm...
9618 : This can't be that hard... Let's think about it... Keeper comes...Bahamut wipes out mankind...
9619 : Keeper comes... Bahamut wipes out mankind...
9620 : Keeper comes... Bahamut...
9621 : Wait a minute! That's it! What if the Keeper of the Apocalypse never comes?
9622 : ...! Then Bahamut would not have to...
9623 : I don't know if this is what Prishe was trying to say, but if we can do something about the keeper, Bahamut won't have any pact to fulfill! Vana'diel will be saved!
9624 : The problem is finding this keeper...
9625 : But we already know who he is! The Keeper of the Apocalypse is Selh'teus! Capturing the boy has been our mission from the start!
9626 : It may be a nearly impossible task, but if we had the assistance of Carbuncle, bringer of rainbows...
9627 : Tenzen! If it is all right, I would like to try and locate Prishe.
9628 : Prishe has the ability to communicate with Selh'teus. Perhaps she knows something that we have yet to realize!
9629 : I am going to further investigate the celestial capital of Al'Taieu. If this is where the boy came from, then there must be a path to return there.
9630 : Splitting up into three groups to find information on Prishe and the keeper... Why didn't I think of that!?
9631 : So what are you going to do, %?
9632 : I'm going to... Investigate Al'Taieu. Find Selh'teus. Find Prishe.
9633 : Louverance...
9634 : I plan on traveling to Tavnazia to further investigate the celestial capital of Al'Taieu.
9635 : It was the Tavnazian Cathedral that brought this name back from obscurity, and it is more than likely the place that the Cardinal Mildaurion seeks out.
9636 : Tenzen...
9637 : %, I journey to the La Theine Plateau in search of the wisdom of Carbuncle.
9638 : With the power and guidance of the bringer of rainbows, I believe we may have a chance at defeating the boy, Selh'teus.
9639 : Ulmia...
9640 : %, I plan to begin my search in San d'Oria.
9641 : If Prishe truly did escape from the glaciers on foot, then that would be the closest city. Perhaps someone spotted her passing through.
9642 : True... If you happen to find out anything useful, come back here, and we'll see what we can make of it. That goes for all of you.
9643 : We're all on this boat for good. We may be in for some rough waters ahead, but you've got nothing to fear with good old Cid at the helm!
9644 : Understood, Master Cid! Now let us be off! We have no time to lose!
9645 : She said that she was heading for San d'Oria.
9646 : He said something about going to ask the assistance of Carbuncle.
9647 : He said that he was heading back to Tavnazia.
9648 : What? You say you're looking for Louverance?
9649 : I'm sorry. I haven't seen him around since he left.
9650 : Uncle Cid! A pack of angry Goblins attacked the Steaming Sheep Restaurant! Master Oggbi drove them away, but not before they injured some of the guests!
9651 : Goblins in Bastok!? ...Is Hilda all right!?
9652 : %!
9653 : Come with us right away! Jabbos has been taken back to Movalpolos!
9654 : ...! Jabbos...!?
9655 : Jabbos? Who's that?
9656 : A Galka who has been living with the Moblins in Movalpolos.
9657 : For the past century he has watched over the creatures...trying to convince them to live in peace with those in the world above their dark caves.
9658 : Forget about that man. He has forgotten his roots--thrown away his identity. He is no longer a Galka.
9659 : The Moblins attacked him? Hmph. It's probably his own fault.
9660 : It may be, but we cannot look the other way. Without the assistance of Jabbos, we may never catch Selh'teus!
9661 : Come, %. We must hurry back to the underground city!
9662 : One hundred years living with the beastmen... That Galka has to be either extremely brave or extremely crazy to attempt a feat like that.
9663 : But wait a minute... All that time together with the Moblins would mean that he would know all their secrets... And that's probably why the little guys came to Bastok to take him back to their city!
9664 : %. You need to hurry back to Movalpolos and help Louverance find Jabbos!
9665 : So let me get this straight, the Keeper of the Apocalypse is actually the reincarnation of the Twilight God!?
9666 : And we're going to have to fight him!? This is not turning out like I wanted it to...
9667 : Does anyone know where the boy, Selh'teus, could have gone off to?
9668 : Can't we ask the Moblins? Maybe they know.
9669 : Selh'teus...is gone... He left...Movalpolos... Moblins...don't know...anything...
9670 : The boy...is gone...
9671 : But my friends... They believe...he will return...so they continue...to dig...
9672 : They will...show him...the way to...the crystal...
9673 : ...
9674 : I see... But considering their previous actions, I think it would be a wise idea to keep a watch on them. Who knows what they might try next.
9675 : If they were to find a way to the fifth mothercrystal before we do, the consequences could be immeasurable.
9676 : I see... But considering their previous actions, I think it would be a wise idea to keep a watch on them. Who knows what they might try next.
9677 : We can't just let them lead the keeper straight to the fifth mothercrystal.
9678 : The Moblins... My friends...wouldn't...
9679 : Master Cid. We have neither the time nor resources to engage the Moblins. Currently we must face the problem before us--Bahamut and his plan to destroy mankind.
9680 : If the Moblins are digging this tunnel for the boy, then chances are that he will return when they are finished. And when he does return, that is our perfect opportunity to catch him!
9681 : That's true...but think of the implications. A path to the fifth crystal will be opened...
9682 : Alright. First we wait for everyone else to get back. There are still quite a few things Prishe needs to clear up. I, myself, am going to need a little more time to finish my work.
9683 : Your work? What are you up to, old man?
9684 : Heh heh heh. Would you like to know? I'm making my wings.
9685 : According to some inside information I just happened to stumble across, Bahamut is hiding out beyond the sea of clouds...higher than any man's ever flown.
9686 : If I tried to take my baby, [/Ultra /Hyper /Psycho /Eternal /Neo /Lovely /Pretty /Final /Extra /Deadly /Savage /Aero /Pseudo /Universal /Exciting /Celestial /Super /Mighty /Mega /Omni /Poly ][/Terror /Perfect /Royale /Gorgeous /Pretty /Hell /Fantasy /Stealth /Powerful /Invincible /Explosive /Storm /Fantastic /Duper /Go-Go /Morphing /Retro /Sonic /Cloud /Sky /Stellar ][/Hyper /Neo /Lovely /Happy /Caller /Hound /XI /Armored /Brutal /Buster /Alpha /Chief /Provoker /Mincer /Streak /King /Prince /Power /Robo /Delver /Mystic ][C.I.D./Enterprise/Nautilus/Gilgamemnon/Redwing/Blackjack/Falcon/Highwind/Ragnarok/Hilda Garde/Prima Vista/Red Rose/Fahrenheit], up there in her current state, she'd be torn to pieces in the turbulence.
9687 : No, there's a few more things I've got to teach her before we have our date in the heavens.
9688 : Excellent! When do you think she will be ready?
9689 : Hold your horses there, Louverance. I'm working as fast as I can. I have some of the best craftsmen in Vana'diel on the project.
9690 : And until we're done, we need you back in Movalpolos keeping an eye on those Moblins. Do you think you can handle that?
9691 : And until we're done, we need you back in Movalpolos keeping an eye on those Moblins. Do you think you can handle that?
9692 : You need not worry, Master Cid. Jabbos has provided me with much information on his subterranean companions.
9693 : And a few of my...friends will also be lending their hands.
9694 : I know...everything about...Movalpolos... I know everything...about Moblins...
9695 : Alright then. It looks like I've found the right men for the job.
9696 : By the way, have you heard anything regarding Lady Prishe?
9697 : While searching for information on Al'Taieu, I learned of a group of Mithra known as sin hunters.
9698 : I am not sure of the details, but I believe they originally traveled from their Mithran homeland to catch Cardinal Mildaurion and punish her for her past crimes.
9699 : However, now that the three believe that the Cardinal is dead, they search for Prishe to have her atone for the sins of Mildaurion.
9700 : That's ridiculous! How do they think that they can get away with something so crazy!?
9701 : We can only hope that Ulmia finds Prishe in San d'Oria before the Mithran Trackers do...
9702 : And then there's Tenzen. No word from him either...
9703 : He said he was heading to the La Theine Plateau to ask the terrestrial avatar Carbuncle for help, but...
9704 : %. Could you try and find out what happened to Ulmia and Tenzen?
9705 : They could be in some real trouble. We're counting on you!
9706 : Sin hunters... Maybe they, too, are thinking Prishe is the cause of all this...
9707 : Master Cid, what are you implying?
9708 : Hm... I'll call Tenzen back from Jeuno and have him head for Movalpolos.
9709 : The things he told us were unbelievable. You've got to hear them for yourself.
9710 : %, we have to find Prishe as soon as possible. That's why I want you to head for San d'Oria and help Ulmia in her search.
9711 : Good luck, and may Altana be with you.
9712 : Hmmm... Ulmia just came by a few days ago with a few of those trackers. They said they had found Prishe, but that she had got away before they could...finish their business.
9713 : They also said that when she escaped, she took a large chunk of magicite known as the Star of Tavnazia with her. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
9714 : The Star of Tavnazia... It was said to have been lost twenty years ago during the Great War... You say that Lady Prishe possesses it!?
9715 : But where could she have run off to...?
9716 : And that's exactly why we're stuck like a chocobo in the mud. Ulmia hasn't slept for days, the poor child.
9717 : Well, all we can do know is wait for Tenzen to come back and pray that he has found something.
9718 : %, Tenzen said he was heading for the La Theine Plateau to find Carbuncle. Why don't you try joining him?
9719 : Master Cid! Has Lady Ulmia returned!? And what of Lady Prishe!?
9720 : Whoa, calm down, now. Why don't you tell us what happened...
9721 : Calm down. Calm down. Ulmia arrived back here a few days ago. She's resting in one of our guest residences. Prishe... Well, there are still no signs of her... But before we set out to look for her, why don't you tell us what you found out on your journey.
9722 : The terrestrial avatars told you that? It's so hard to believe, but...
9723 : Some of the things Nag'molada said do make some sense.
9724 : For example, the recent strange energy readings from the crags. I've studied those as well.
9725 : But I never imagined that the remnants of the ancients were trying to do something as crazy as that--using the lines to converge the energy from all five crystals...
9726 : ...and ultimately use that concentrated power to open the Gates of Paradise...
9727 : Hmmm... I'm not positive, but with that much energy, opening the gates may not be as impossible as it sounds.
9728 : And with all the technology those hooded scientists in Jeuno have...
9729 : But wait a minute. Didn't they already try opening the gates ten thousand years ago...and fail miserably? Just look at their capital! It sunk to the bottom of the sea.
9730 : Until we find out what this Paradise place really is, we can't let the Zilart go on doing as they please.
9731 : That is true, but we first must face the problem that lies before us--the Keeper of the Apocalypse!
9732 : I was certain that Selh'teus was the one we were searching for, but after hearing the testimony of Fenrir...
9733 : That the Keeper of the Apocalypse would be born unto Tavnazia...
9734 : Tenzen. According to what you've told me, Prishe's treatment in Tavnazia was quite out of the ordinary.
9735 : Are you trying to say that this is because...she is the keeper?
9736 : While it pains me to believe so, all the recent events seem to point to that conclusion. I have asked Phoenix numerous times for an answer, but she only replies that she, too, does not know...
9737 : But if it is true--if Prishe is the Keeper of the Apocalypse...then there is only one thing I can do...
9738 : Hold on, Tenzen! We still don't know for sure that she's the one!
9739 : Yeah, she's a little rude, and a little crude, and a heck of a lot wilder than I like most of my company. But once you get past that, you realize that she's one of the most honest people you'll ever meet. I couldn't imagine her lying to a soul, let alone be untrue to herself.
9740 : Tenzen, you can't truly believe that she's inherited the will of Promathia, can you?
9741 : However, I cannot doubt what I saw. I believe that Fenrir showed me what he did for a reason.
9742 : It is the sole wish of the terrestrial avatars to keep the Gates of Paradise closed. Anyone who attempts to open the gates will undoubtedly become their enemy.
9743 : Perhaps the will of Promathia remains dormant within Lady Prishe. Perhaps she simply has not realized that she carries the seed of twilight.
9744 : ...
9745 : Well, there's one way to find out--and that's finding Prishe.
9746 : We can decide what to do then...even if that involves...
9747 : %, I want you to head for San d'Oria and check up on Ulmia.
9748 : It also worries me how we haven't heard anything from Louverance as well...
9749 : He said he was going to try to gather information on the celestial capital of Al'Taieu, but...
9750 : I will travel to Jeuno and investigate the situation there. If the Duchy were to find Prishe before we do...
9751 : Farewell, Master Cid.
9752 : Ahem! We do have some good news for you, though, Tenzen. It sounds like Louverance was able to find Selh'teus.
9753 : On top of that, we also may have found a way to get to the fifth mothercrystal under the North Sea.
9754 : You have what!?
9755 : If you want the details, you should go talk with Louverance yourself.
9756 : Raibaht, would you tell Tenzen where he can find his companions?
9757 : Alright. But I'm going to have to ask you to refrain from questioning Ulmia until Louverance gets back. We don't want to jump to any conclusions before we've grasped the whole picture.
9758 : Tenzen. I understand that you blame yourself for not being able to find Prishe, but think of poor Ulmia and how she would react.
9759 : Very well, Master Cid. I promise I will not speak of what I saw to lady Ulmia until the return of Sir Louverance.
9760 : If it is not too much to ask, might I inquire as to where she is staying?
9761 : Raibaht, show Tenzen to Ulmia's room.
9762 : %... To tell you the truth, I think we may be in way over our heads here...
9763 : Up until now, whether it be for science or justice, I've never thought too deeply about what I was getting into--I just took the ball and ran with it as fast as I could. But this time... This time a little voice in the back of my head is telling me that I should be careful. I don't know. Maybe I'm just getting old.
9764 : It's those ancients that you keep talking about. If they're rooted firmly in Jeuno, there may not be anything we can do to pull them out.
9765 : Fighting wyrms and beastmen is bad enough. I shudder to think what would happen if the Duchy's army was thrown into the mix...
9766 : And there's something else that has been bothering me.
9767 : This Far Eastern country that Tenzen has supposedly traveled from... Even the pirates of Norg know little about it. How do we know if we can really trust him...?
9768 : Who speaks the truth and who peddles lies? It is becoming harder and harder to tell. I see a storm brewing on our horizon. If we don't take care, our ship may sink, and everything we have fought for up to now may be lost.
9769 : If you really want to save your nation and its people, you have to be strong. See things with your own eyes; make decisions with your own heart. Don't be fooled by those with ulterior motives.
9770 : Oh, sorry about that, %. I didn't mean to sound like a father scolding his [son/daughter].
9771 : Hm? What's wrong?
9772 : Louverance mentioned he was going to begin his search for Al'Taieu in Tavnazia.
9773 : If you hurry, you might be able to catch up with him.
9774 : And I know I just told you to make decisions with your own heart, but I think that another good thing for you to do right now is find Prishe...
9775 : Ulmia said that she was going to San d'Oria to look for her. Why don't you go and see if she found anything?
9776 : If Prishe is the abhorrent one like Tenzen says she is, then our only key to saving her will be Ulmia.
9777 : Hurry, %. I don't think that we have much more time. We have to get to Prishe before...
9778 : Ulmia!? Who is that with you? They're not...
9779 : Yes, they are the Mithran sin hunters--the trackers who have come to our land to find Prishe.
9780 : Mithran sin hunters! Then Prishe has already been...punished!?
9781 : Of course not, Master Cid! However, we were able to find her!
9782 : But now she is gone again... And she took the magicite with her!
9783 : Ulmia!? Hm? And who might these three be?
9784 : They are the Mithran Trackers--sin hunters who have come from the Mithran homeland to find...Prishe.
9785 : Sin hunters! What did Prishe ever do to the Mithra!? Wait, does this mean you found her?
9786 : Yes, we were able to locate her.
9787 : However, she went off on her own again...with the magicite...
9788 : The magicite! Fill me in on the details, Ulmia.
9789 : I see... I didn't realize that Tavnazia's magicite was that powerful...or that dangerous.
9790 : So, it was the energy from that stone that affected the members of the Multinational Expedition--it invaded their hearts and minds, ultimately driving them to do the unspeakable.
9791 : Exactly. Our country's rrrepresentative on that expedition found a shard of magicite and brought it back to our homeland. It was then that we, too, realized its terrifying power.
9792 : However, we were never told where that shard came from. Further Mithran expeditions were sent to the Northlands to investigate the stone's origins, but they were unsuccessful.
9793 : No, it was a completely different investigation that led us to the answer. While searching for the rrrelic of the dragon stolen from the Temple of Uggalepih, we found what we were looking for.
9794 : You... You met with Prishe and Cardinal Mildaurion in the Tavnazian Cathedral?
9795 : After a bit of...persuasion, the cardinal showed us what they called the Star of Tavnazia. In other words--magicite.
9796 : We told her of the terrible power that the magicite contained, and demanded that she dispose of it somewhere it would never be seen again.
9797 : However, the cardinal would not listen to rrreason.
9798 : She would only say that the stone was necessary to wake the gods from their eternal slumber.
9799 : Wake the gods...? But that's...!
9800 : I could not bring myself to believe Miss Shikaree's words, either. Not until I heard the same story from the San d'Orian Cathedral...
9801 : The hymns the Tavnazian choir would sing... Their words possessed the power to bring the gods back to life.
9802 : A stone... A song...
9803 : Wait! That song Prishe sang to help Selh'teus escape. Is that the same song?
9804 : And so, the whole song has been recited...?
9805 : No. There is a fifth verse...and only the sleeping gods know it.
9806 : However, if one were to inquire with the god that recently awoke in the Uleguerand Range, it is only a matter of time before the fifth and final verse is sung.
9807 : Or possibly the woman in Sel-- No, I cannot trust you yet with that information. Good day.
9808 : Master Cid, I wish to continue my search for Prishe with the three Mithran Trackers.
9809 : Whoa, hold on there, Ulmia. The trackers are only looking for Prishe so they can...you know...punish her.
9810 : To ensure her safety, we have to find Prishe before those frisky felines do.
9811 : (This is just between you and me, but I've already talked things over with some of my...acquaintances in the Tenshodo and Norg. They're scouring the continent for any information on our blue-haired princess. If they find anything, we'll be the first to know. That's why you need to stick around--so you can be here when that info comes in.)
9812 : Thank you, Master Cid...for everything...
9813 : And to top that off, we've got a first-class adventurer on our side. Isn't that right, %?
9814 : [He's/She's] going to go find out if Louverance has discovered anything of interest.
9815 : I'm still not too sure why Prishe would just run off with that fragment of the Star of Tavnazia, but I'll bet my apron that it has something to do with that Cardinal Mildaurion.
9816 : %. Louverance said he was looking for the cardinal. Maybe he knows something that could be of use. If you hurry, you might be able to catch up with him.
9817 : I'm still not too sure why Prishe would just run off with that fragment of the Star of Tavnazia, but I'll bet my apron that it has something to do with that boy, Selh'teus.
9818 : If Tenzen returns and we can catch this so-called Keeper of the Apocalypse in Movalpolos, the clouds covering this mystery we're knee-deep in just might clear up.
9819 : %, Tenzen said he was heading to the La Theine Plateau to find Carbuncle. If you hurry, you might be able to meet up with him.
9820 : Raibaht, take Ulmia to Cornelia's quarters and have the president's daughter prepare a room for our guest.
9821 : Yes, sir...
9822 : %, with all she's gone through, I don't think it would be wise to inform Ulmia of what Tenzen discovered just yet.
9823 : We can't jump to any conclusions about Prishe being the Keeper of the Apocalypse without hearing what our San d'Orian friend has to say.
9824 : Uncle Cid! The Tenshodo just sent a message! Prishe has been spotted--in Jeuno!
9825 : What!?
9826 : Prishe? In Jeuno!?
9827 : They told her that there was a warrant out for her capture, but she didn't seem to listen.
9828 : What's wrong? Why would she go and risk being captured!?
9829 : Jeuno... Perhaps... Perhaps she has gone to meet with...
9830 : Ulmia? Is there something we should know?
9831 : Master Cid! I must leave for Jeuno immediately!
9832 : Ulmia!
9833 : This doesn't look good... Raibaht! Find Tenzen[/ and Louverance] and tell [him/them] what has happened. Then hurry to Jeuno.
9834 : Tell [him/them] not to worry about Movalpolos. I'll have a party of musketeers...no, gold musketeers sent there right away.
9835 : %. You had better go to Jeuno as well.
9836 : If you can't find Prishe, then we'll all meet in front of the Grand Duke Palace and plan our next move.
9837 : If she's already been captured, then I can guarantee you she'll be somewhere in that building.
9838 : %! Where have you been!?
9839 : I heard about what happened, but I still can't believe it...
9840 : Learning Prishe was really the Keeper of the Apocalypse knocked me off my chair...
9841 : But finding out that the Jeunoan official Esha'ntarl is actually Cardinal Mildaurion, and that she's been alive for the past ten thousand years...that was like having an anvil dropped on my head.
9842 : %. I want to hear what happened with you, too. Call in all the others.
9843 : Hmmm. So that's what happened...
9844 : To fulfill the pact that Bahamut and Selh'teus made over ten thousand years ago, Mildaurion has been attempting to revive Divine Promathia...
9845 : And the magicite embedded in Prishe's bosom was only a sealed, crystallized form of her inner Emptiness.
9846 : We sin hunters have committed a grave sin ourselves in not being able to stay calm and focused in the presence of the magicite.
9847 : Not a single complaint... Not a single cry for help... All that time carrying a terrible burden...alone...
9848 : And what about Ulmia? She has known Prishe since she was a child. She has watched her silently struggle.
9849 : These new truths must be as painful for her as they are for Prishe.
9850 : I could not wish such a terrible fate upon even an enemy.
9851 : What are we to do now?
9852 : Phoenix has told me that we are not to provoke Bahamut any further.
9853 : However, the biggest threat to mankind is the Wyrmking's aerial magick.
9854 : If we could defeat him, it would better our chances for victory against the wyrm armies.
9855 : And so we are left with three choices.
9856 : We can let destiny run its course and wait for Bahamut and his minions to destroy us...
9857 : We can use my airship to join the Jeuno armada and fight the Wyrmking...
9858 : Or we can recite the fifth verse of the Memoria de la S^tona and call the Twilight God down onto Prishe...
9859 : Twilight God... He cursed...mankind... Made us...fight...
9860 : If we...defeat him...the curse...will be broken...
9861 : But...do we have...the power...?
9862 : Prishe said that % had that power.
9863 : And we have Phoenix on our side!
9864 : But I am not sure that is enough...
9865 : Diabolos, ruler of dreams, warned us that no single child of Vana'diel could vanquish the Keeper of the Apocalypse.
9866 : And still my blade remains silent...
9867 : We are about to walk down a very dangerous path...
9868 : But I think it would be wise to wait until Prishe returns before we take any action.
9869 : Tenzen, Ms. Sin Hunters, %...
9870 : Hurry to Tavnazia and wait for Prishe. When she arrives, contact me and I will fly to the archipelago in my airship.
9871 : Tavnazia? But why would you travel there?
9872 : Help from Gilgamesh should be arriving at the safehold shortly.
9873 : Let's just say the parts they'll be transporting are very...sensitive.
9874 : I'll see you all at the Sealion's Den!
9875 : Welcome back, everybody!
9876 : I'm glad to see that you're all safe. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to meet you in Tavnazia.
9877 : Cid! Can the small talk and get your hunk-o-junk airship's motor runnin'!
9878 : Hold on, little lady. You just got back. Don't tell me that you're ready to go back to the clouds.
9879 : I thought we were leaving Bahamut to the armada.
9880 : We are! Our destination is the Keeper of the Apocalypse and Nag'molada!
9881 : Nag'molada...invaded Movalpolos...blocked entrance...to fifth crystal... Hurt friends...
9882 : But there is still a way. Phoenix will lead us!
9883 : The fifth mothercrystal? Isn't that supposed to be somewhere under Shu'Meyo?
9884 : Now that you mention it, I just received a report that a strange red light began shooting up from the north sea.
9885 : A light? That's it! Let's go! Come on! Come on!
9886 : Hold your horses, Prishe. My bird's still beat up pretty bad, and it will take a little longer to fix her up.
9887 : Huh!? But we're so damn close!
9888 : By the time the rrrepairs have been made, the armada will have already set off for Bahamut...
9889 : And Cid's is the only ship fast enough and strong enough to make the journey. It seems as if our luck has finally trickled away.
9890 : No. I cannot believe that Altana has turned her back on us.
9891 : I believe the goddess has granted us this time to prepare our hearts and our souls for what may be the final battle.
9892 : Time... I will use...this time to...heal my friends...
9893 : And I will use this time to help Cid with the airship's repairs!
9894 : Hah hah hah! Another hand is always welcome. This is starting to look like it's going to be the biggest repair job in the history of Vana'diel!
9895 : And I'm not just talking about the airship! It's time we get out there and save the world!
9896 : You took the words right out of my mouth, old man! Vana'diel's not finished yet! At least not if I have anything to say about it!
9897 : %! Are you ready to go kick some apocalyptic butt!?
9898 : Well? Let's give 'em hell! Do we have to go now?
9899 : Heh heh! You took the words right out of my mouth!
9900 : Huh!? You're not slitherin' your way out of this one, %! We need you!
9901 : Alright, everybody, you heard Ulmia! Go out and do what you have to do. When my baby's ready I'll give you a call!
9902 : My bird's repairs are going smoother than I could have ever imagined. With all the confusion in Jeuno, nobody has the time to complain about an unauthorized test run every now and then! Hah hah hah!
9903 : Yeah, but to tell you the truth, I'm sure glad I got to meet up with Prishe again. She's one hell of a girl. I wouldn't be surprised if she saved Vana'diel with her own two hands!
9904 : Well, that finishes up our maintenance on the cannons.
9905 : The old girls have been kept in pretty good shape. They should hold up if the need for them arises.
9906 : I just hope nothing that bad ever happens.
9907 : I would have to agree.
9908 : But we must stay on our guard. That beastman lair appeared overnight, right on our doorstep...
9909 : Greetings, adventurer. Have you come looking for employment?
9910 : Looking for work? Now that you mention it... Not today...
9911 : I have a task perfectly suited for an adventurer.
9912 : Have you heard about the Goblin lair that suddenly appeared in North Gustaberg?
9913 : According to scholars, the Goblins living in this lair are a separate tribe known as the Moblins.
9914 : Goblins ordinarily avoid gathering together and building settlements, but apparently these Moblins have a vastly different social structure.
9915 : With several of their number living in Jeuno, it can be said that we are on much friendlier terms with Goblins than the other beastmen races.
9916 : However, there is still much we don't know about the Moblins.
9917 : In order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, we need to determine whether or not they harbor hostile intentions towards us.
9918 : Preparations for military action are underway. But first we wish to ask adventurers like you to conduct a thorough investigation.
9919 : Will you undertake this task?
9920 : Will you do it? Yes. No.
9921 : Excellent. Please report to the scholar at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant for further details.
9922 : I'm sorry to hear that. Please be sure to talk to me again if you change your mind.
9923 : A beastman lair has appeared in North Gustaberg. The Goblins living in this lair are a separate tribe known as the Moblins.
9924 : Please report to the scholar at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant for further details on your task.
9925 : ...Crystal propulsion unit... ......Hooded scientists.........
9926 : ... You have to promise me you won't tell anyone else what I'm about to tell you.
9927 : ... Remember, you are not to tell anyone that the chief is building a new airship.
9928 : Currently, the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, in conjunction with the air travel agency, has formed a monopoly on all forms of airship travel.
9929 : To compete against Jeuno's empire in the skies, we must reinforce our research in aeronautics development. However, if the Duchy were to learn of our actions, they would not be pleased.
9930 : That is why our chief has gone to great lengths to keep his acquisition of an out-of-service airship a secret to all but those who need to know.
9931 : And that is why we must not draw any attention to ourselves by collecting large quantities of materials at one time.
9932 : However, our supply of % has almost run dry. If we don't have enough of that item, we cannot continue our modifications of the airship.
9933 : To help the chief with his airship modification project, we need a large quantity of %...
9934 : However, we do not want to draw any unwanted attention to ourselves by importing through Jeuno...
9935 : This is exactly what the chief needs for his project. The Republic thanks you for your assistance.
9936 : It is not much, but here is a bit of reimbursement.
9937 : ... We have a slight problem... The chief asked an adventurer to bring him a highly advanced altimeter from Jeuno.
9938 : However, while the adventurer was traveling through the Duchy, he was stopped and arrested for attempting to transport the restricted item.
9939 : While the adventurer was able to hide the % before he was taken into custody, he has been ordered to defeat an unknown beast in Delkfutt's Tower before he can return home.
9940 : We do not have the time to wait for him, and that is why we need your assistance again. Would you travel to Delkfutt's Tower, ask the adventurer where he hid the %, then find it and bring it back here?
9941 : You may use this %. If you put the % in it, the Ducal Guard and the customs officials at the air travel agency should not find the item.
9942 : Accept the job? Yes. No.
9943 : The adventurer we seek has been ordered to defeat a monster known as Orna. Find the monster...and you will find him.
9944 : The adventurer we seek has been ordered to travel to Delkfutt's Tower and defeat a monster known as Orna.
9945 : Find that man and have him tell you where he hid the %.
9946 : With this, the chief will be able to improve on his current theories and further develop new aerodynamic technologies.
9947 : Again, it is not much, but please accept this reward for your services.
9948 : The chief's theories are flawless. However, there remains one mountain he still must conquer.
9949 : I don't know the details, but the chief has been up day and night trying to solve this final problem.
9950 : Normally at times like these, I would not bother him...
9951 : But I fear that this may be too difficult for the chief to handle on his own. Even Lady Cornelia has begun to worry about her father's long-time friend.
9952 : After watching the chief for the past few weeks, I think I came to realize what was troubling him.
9953 : Until recently, Chief Cid had been working on what he called a semiperpetual motion engine. However, after months of making little or no progress, he finally gave up on the idea.
9954 : If he were only able to acquire the % that had been used in previous semiperpetual motion experiments...
9955 : It is said that the ancients were able to process the material and harness its hidden power, but since then, no one has succeeded in reproducing those results.
9956 : This... The % of legend! But it cannot be...
9957 : Let us show it to the chief and see what he has to say.
9958 : Chief Cid. % has found what [he/she] claims is %.
9959 : What!? But I thought that stone no longer remained on Vana'diel!
9960 : Amazing... Just as the legends say. This heat that the % produces... Where does it come from?
9961 : You have done well, %. Now the chief can continue his experiments.
9962 : Chief Cid. With the %, your dream of building a semiperpetual motion engine will finally be realized.
9963 : Hm? The what? Oh, that project? I gave up on that weeks ago. But this stone... Just think of all the possibilities!
9964 : Ahem! But there are much more important things to be worried about right now. There's this one thing that's been troubling me for the past month.
9965 : And what would that be, chief?
9966 : What else? The name for my new bird!
9967 : I thought about simply calling her the C.I.D. but where's the fun in that?
9968 : Right now I'm simply calling her the Cid, but where's the fun in that?
9969 : That's it! %, you've been helping me prepare my big girl. Why don't you make the final call?
9970 : I've come up with a few ideas of my own. Choose from these.
9971 : What should the first part of the name be?
9972 : Start with... Nothing. Ultra Hyper Psycho Eternal Neo Lovely Pretty Final Extra Deadly Savage Aero Pseudo Universal Exciting Celestial Super Mighty Mega Omni Poly
9973 : Add... Nothing. Terror Perfect Royale Gorgeous Pretty Hell Fantasy Stealth Powerful Invincible Explosive Storm Fantastic Duper Go-Go Morphing Retro Sonic Cloud Sky Stellar
9974 : And finish with... Nothing. Hyper Neo Lovely Happy Caller Hound XI Armored Brutal Buster Alpha Chief Provoker Mincer Streak King Prince Power Robo Delver Mystic
9975 : Well, I can say that I could've never thought up such an...um...original name.
9976 : Now that load is off my shoulders, I can return to my regular experiments! Ha ha ha!
9977 : ...
9978 : ...%. If you ever wish to...rethink the name you have given the chief's airship, please bring another %. Any further aid would be greatly appreciated.
9979 : Thank you.

9983 : Ravorara has given me her report.  I also managed to locate records that mention the appearance of Movalpolos a century ago.
9984 : These records state that the Moblins apparently stole various items from Selbina--a Bastokan territory at the time--and also from the city of Bastok itself.
9985 : However, after this incident they disappeared from the pages of history.
9986 : The Moblin race did not answer the Shadow Lord's call to arms.
9987 : And then there is this book of worship you recovered from Movalpolos...
9988 : Personally, I do not think these facts constitute proof that the Moblins are advocates of the Dawn Goddess.
9989 : According to Chief Engineer Cid, there is a high probability that the Moblins are planning something unfavorable for Bastok...
9990 : [However, /]Virnage, a priest staying at the Bat's Lair in the Mines District, wishes to determine where the Moblins' true faith lies.
9991 : He would like to employ an adventurer to communicate with the Moblins.
9992 : Virnage is willing to pay a reward for your services, so it could be worth your while to hear his proposal.
9993 : Virnage, a priest staying at the Bat's Lair in the Mines District, has shown an interest in the book of worship the Moblins were keeping in Movalpolos.
9994 : Maybe someday I'll be able to sell goods from Qufim Island... Someday...
9995 : Hey, it's your lucky day! I've got a fresh batch of goods straight from the island of Qufim!
9996 : Hey! You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right? Take this letter to that [cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?
9997 : Excuse me, [mister/lady]. Would you take this letter to the [guy/lady] in the red hat?
9998 : Adventurer-[man/lady]! Could you take this letter to that funny [guy/lady] in the red hat?
9999 : I would like to take this letter to a certain [fellow/woman] wearing a red chapeaux; however, my parents do not allow me to stray far from home. Kind adventurer, might you deliver it in my stead?
10000 : Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
10001 : Whoa! Thanks, [misterrr/lady]!
10002 : Thank you so very much, [sir/ma'am]!
10003 : Another present? Sorry, but I only have two hands, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!
10004 : Wow! Another present! Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?
10005 : Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent? You're starrrting to scare me, [mister/lady]...
10006 : I just accepted a gift from you, kind [sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.
10007 : ou've brought joy to the children of Vana'diel!
10008 : ou've brought barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel!
10009 : ##
10010 : Friar Virnage has informed me of the existence of a Movalpolos inhabitant that speaks our language.
10011 : It seems this linguist is responsible for facilitating your safe return.
10012 : This may be our chance to discover the reason behind the appearance of the Moblin lair in Gustaberg, and learn of their intentions in the area.
10013 : Our future military incursions into Movalpolos could be greatly aided with an ally on the inside.
10014 : You must track down this person again and investigate what exactly is going on in the tunnels of Movalpolos.
10015 : Return to Movalpolos and seek out the one who aided you. Find out what is happening in those tunnels.
10016 : Find the one in Movalpolos who can help us with the Moblin language.
10017 : How did you fare? Were you able to meet with your linguist friend?
10018 : I see. So he has been trying to convince the Moblins not to cause a war with Bastok.
10019 : And that is why they have yet to make a move...
10020 : What we should be fearful of, though, is the Moblin faith in the Twilight God--that they go so far as to call themselves the children of Promathia.
10021 : Considering the advanced technology and rabid fanaticism of Movalpolos, we cannot afford to simply stand idle and see what happens.
10022 : However, if the plan you received from the tactician staying in Kazham has dulled the edge of Moblin hostility...
10023 : I cannot with all confidence say that beginning a war with Movalpolos is the wisest course.
10024 : I will report these findings to the president. His evaluation will help decide our military involvement--if any.
10025 : You are to be commended for your continuing service to Bastok. Please accept this reward.
10026 : I will report these findings to the president. His evaluation will help decide our military involvement--if any.
10027 : Adventurers don't seem to be aware of the fact, but the Bastokan navy is the most powerful force on the high seas. We have zero tolerance for acts of piracy in our waters.
10028 : I am Naval Recruit Training Officer Vladinek. What can I do for you?
10029 : Great! I finally found you!
10030 : You again? Why do you keep following me?
10031 : Whatever. I have to speak with Mister Vladinek.
10032 : Is there something I can help you with, young lady?
10033 : Yes. My name is Sanctia. I am searching for the bounty hunter Goldmane to ask him something very important.
10034 : Goldmane?
10035 : Yes. I have reason to believe he is being sheltered by the Bastokan navy.
10036 : And that he is paying for that protection with Atarefaunet's bounty.
10037 : Ahahaha. What an amusing idea.
10038 : The Bastokan navy is not for rent, my dear.
10039 : And I don't know anyone who could stand to live on one of our battleships for twenty years!
10040 : But...  But the letter had your name...
10041 : I see. That old letter is the cause of all this.
10042 : Let me explain. I wrote that letter to Goldmane concerning another bounty hunter.
10043 : You mean Goldmane's partner, Ismenios Cutsilver?
10044 : Correct. Ismenios was the son of Praefactus Leonnel of the Bastokan navy, and a former student of mine.
10045 : Ismenios graduated from the Naval Recruit Training Barracks with the highest honors and the potential to become a talented commander.
10046 : Then one day, apparently unfulfilled by naval life, he declared he would leave Praefactus Leonnel's command to become a bounty hunter.
10047 : Praefactus Leonnel made no effort to track down his son.
10048 : But I had swung a sword alongside Leonnel in the Great War, and had gotten to know him well. I could tell he was hurting inside.
10049 : Along with Goldmane's cooperation, I convinced Ismenios that he should return to Bastok.
10050 : No matter the situation, parents always worry for their children, kupopo.
10051 : ...
10052 : But do you know the whole story, young lady?
10053 : Before his journey home, Ismenios Cutsilver lost his life during the capture of Atarefaunet.
10054 : The Musketeer investigation of the incident showed that Goldmane was responsible for Ismenios's death.
10055 : Praefactus Leonnel would never stoop to anything so juvenile as revenge. But he has never forgiven Goldmane.
10056 : So you see, there is no way the man you seek would be under the protection of the Bastokan navy.
10057 : Then where on Vana'diel could Goldmane be hiding...?
10058 : Well, now that you mention it...
10059 : There have been rumors of the remaining thugs of Atarefaunet's Band sniffing around for your elusive bounty hunter.
10060 : Whispers in dark corners have them on the trail of the owner of Purgonorgo Isle, one of the islands found in Bibiki Bay.
10061 : Purgonorgo Isle...
10062 : Thank you so much, Naval Officer Training Recruit Vladinek!
10063 : Training Recruit, kupopo...!? Sanctia!
10064 : The young lady with the moogle said she was headed for Purgonorgo Isle. If you are a friend of hers, I suggest you keep a close eye on her. The world can be a dangerous place.
10065 : Hm...?
10066 : Chips from Pso'Xja... But how did you know I was collecting these?
10067 : Ah, the Tenshodo... So Aldo and his crew have finally started to realize the chips' true value.
10068 : At any rate, I thank you for your donation. Here, I want you to have this. We've learned a few things studying the makeup of these contraptions.
10069 : While you cannot tell by just looking at them, these tiny stones carry an enormous amount of data--the kind of data that can be found in powerful biotechnological weapons. Unfortunately, that's not a field I am well-versed in.
10070 : However, when I was in Jeuno working on the development of the Duchy's airships, I did have the opportunity to witness chip technology at work.
10071 : And from what I saw, it's safe to say that the men and women involved in that project were not thinking about peace and prosperity for all mankind.
10072 : That's why I've been using these chips to try to develop a way to neutralize the weapons...if it ever should come to that.
10073 : This pump is just a prototype, but it might be of some use if you find yourself in a tight situation.
10074 : I plan on continuing my research, so if you happen to find any more chips, bring them to my lab and I will keep you informed of my latest findings.
10075 : Ah, another set of chips. Thank you, %.
10076 : But this means...you had to use the pump...
10077 : No, maybe it's better that I not know... I'll just keep fighting my battles; you keep fighting yours.
10078 : So, %. Come to check up on my progress with the airship repairs, huh?
10079 : Truth be told, she's even more beat up than I thought. I've got Louverance and the Mithra girls out finding me supplies, but...
10080 : It's the crystal propulsion unit. The heart of my beautiful bird has been broken.
10081 : Tenzen seemed to think that we could find a solution to our problem in Jeuno, but I haven't seen hide nor hair of him since he left.
10082 : Hmmm. If I had a less complicated device that showed how the ancients sublimated the power of the crystals, then maybe I could fix the propulsion unit myself...
10083 : Well, there's no point in gathering any more supplies at this stage. Would you go and tell Louverance and the ladies to come back to Bastok?
10084 : Louverance should be near Carpenters' Landing looking for lumber, and Shikaree Z was off to Bibiki Bay to find some special ores.
10085 : Hey, Cid! We've pretty much finished patching up Jabbos's buddies!
10086 : What's the word on the bird? Is the [/Ultra /Hyper /Psycho /Eternal /Neo /Lovely /Pretty /Final /Extra /Deadly /Savage /Aero /Pseudo /Universal /Exciting /Celestial /Super /Mighty /Mega /Omni /Poly ][/Terror /Perfect /Royale /Gorgeous /Pretty /Hell /Fantasy /Stealth /Powerful /Invincible /Explosive /Storm /Fantastic /Duper /Go-Go /Morphing /Retro /Sonic /Cloud /Sky /Stellar ][/Hyper /Neo /Lovely /Happy /Caller /Hound /XI /Armored /Brutal /Buster /Alpha /Chief /Provoker /Mincer /Streak /King /Prince /Power /Robo /Delver /Mystic ]P.R.I.S.H.E. ready to fly?
10087 : Well, you see, there's still this little problem with the propulsion unit...
10088 : What the hell!? Are you still fooling around with that thing? Didn't you get any visitors from Jeuno yet?
10089 : Visitors from Jeuno? Not that I've noticed.
10090 : Prishe, you refer to the sacred vessel mentioned by Cardinal Mildaurion?
10091 : The cardinal asked the Chebukki siblings to bring you an item that may be of some use in your repairs.
10092 : The little ones said they planned to return to Tavnazia, but I just assumed this would be after they delivered the vessel to you, Master Cid...
10093 : Those dirty rats are up to their old tricks again!
10094 : They didn't have the box on them last time we met, so I guess they weren't lying about heading back to the safehold.
10095 : They must've hidden it somewhere in Tavnazia. Gutsy little buggers, I'll give 'em that much!
10096 : Hey, %! You don't need a ship to get back to Tavnazia, right? Go and get that light box back from the Chebukkis!
10097 : I bet they're keeping it in their old shed on the Misareaux Coast. Keep an eye out for traps and tricks, %!
10098 : A box of light, huh? I've never seen the actual vessel itself, but from what I've heard, the box is meant to contain the power of the crystals.
10099 : If this vessel is capable of amplifying and emitting that power, it should help to explain the workings of the crystal propulsion unit in the airship.
10100 : A device that you can carry around will no doubt be a lot easier to understand than one of those huge crystal engines.
10101 : %. Find that shed on the Misareaux Coast and get your hands on that box.
10102 : Oh, and don't forget to bring back Louverance from Carpenters' Landing, and Shikaree Z from Bibiki Bay.

10104 : Welcome back, %! So this is the box that everyone's been talking about.
10105 : Tenzen was there to lend you a hand? Well, thank Altana for small blessings!
10106 : I'll get straight to work analyzing this thing!

10110 : Welcome back, %! So this is the box that everyone's been talking about.
10111 : Tenzen was there to lend you a hand? Well, thank Altana for small blessings!
10112 : I'll get straight to work analyzing this thing!
10113 : Whoah! Old Cid's brain has gone into overdrive. All those numbers are making me dizzy!
10114 : Looks like the crystal thingamabob will be back in working order in no time!
10115 : One other thing, %...
10116 : Prishe and I have used the time granted to us by Altana's grace to compose these letters.
10117 : There is one addressed to Granpere, one for the Tavnazian patrol, and one for all the citizens of the safehold.
10118 : I hesitate to ask after all you have done, but would you deliver these letters to Sueleen in the Sealion's Den?
10119 : I tried to convince her she was wastin' her time with these sappy messages, but you know how Ulmia gets.
10120 : Tell Sueleen to hand out the letters if we don't make it back. She can be trusted to do as we ask.
10121 : Thanks a bunch, %!
10122 : This...this is astounding! This is a working example of the ancients' theories...
10123 : Hm? You've been to see Louverance and Shikaree Z? I knew I could count on you, %!
10124 : Now I can concentrate fully on my analysis...
10125 : I'm a little busy right now, %. Did you deliver those letters yet? You'd better be off for Tavnazia.
10126 : You are here to report on your activities, as well? The number of adventurers coming through here today has been nothing short of astounding. Now, about your report...
10127 : Perhaps you should lend an ear to the townspeople a little more often. You might be surprised by the discoveries you can make by speaking with the local citizenry.
10128 : It appears you have spent some time talking with the local citizenry. However, you must decide for yourself how to act upon what you have learned.
10129 : It appears you spend a great deal of time interacting with the local citizenry. An admirable quality in an adventurer.
10130 : And, let's see here... Do you often avoid conversation with your adventuring companions? A time may come when you cannot achieve an adventuring goal on your own...
10131 : And, let's see here... You seem to be participating in party conversation. Continue to communicate with your companions and you will reap the benefits that solid frienships bring.
10132 : And, let's see here... Your lively participation in party conversation must greatly enhance your adventuring activities. There is no greater asset to an adventurer than trustworthy companions.
10133 : As a last piece of advice, I would recommend taking advantage of this Adventurer Appreciation event to join a party with those you might not ordinarily encounter.
10134 : On a final note, I'm happy to see you taking advantage of this Adventurer Appreciation event to join a party with such diverse members.
10135 : I will communicate my evaluation to the event administrators. Be sure to complete your report in every nation before returning to speak with a moogle.
10136 : It's about time you showed up, %. Thought I'd find you resting up at home after what happened, but you just can't stay put, can you?
10137 : I was almost ready to throw in the apron. Even the messengers I sent after you never got back to me...
10138 : %. I understand that you're busy with missions, but I had a hell of a time trying to get in touch with you.
10139 : Anyway, at least you're here in time to see off Tenzen.
10140 : Everyone else has said their goodbyes except you, it seems.
10141 : Hm? You wanna know where he's off to?
10142 : After hearing that the Emptiness no longer threatens his homeland, Tenzen began preparations to return to the Far East.
10143 : The Tenshodo here in Bastok will ferry him to Norg, then the pirates will see him safely across the seas.
10144 : I'll take you to Tenzen's ship.
10145 : [Sir/Lady] %! You have come!
10146 : I prayed we would have one last meeting before my departure.
10147 : My treacherous actions betrayed the sacrifices you made for me...
10148 : And I fully intended to erase this dishonor as tradition demands. But another duty has stayed my hand...
10149 : The Emptiness has been defeated. However, the war and strife born from that darkness continue to plague our people with misery.
10150 : Lord Tenzen must return home to quell this unrest.
10151 : In exchange for this leniency, I offer my own life to assuage the insult to your honor...
10152 : What do you do? Forgive Tenzen. Take your revenge.
10153 : [Sir/Lady] %. Your kindness will never be forgotten.
10154 : I swear on my blade to mend the wounds of my homeland using this life you have spared.
10155 : Once all is well, you must come and see the Far East for yourself.
10156 : The beauty of the cherry blossoms is beyond description...
10157 : I hate to spoil the moment, but it looks like the Tenshodo are ready to ship out.
10158 : Until next we meet, [Sir/Lady] %.
10159 : The [dummy/hope/hope/trust/trust/courage/courage/justice/compassion] you have shown me will bind our fates for eternity.
10160 : I heard what happened between you and Tenzen, %.
10161 : There's no easy way to recover from a blow like that. But as a special favor to me, I'm asking you to let it go this time.
10162 : Sir Cid...
10163 : I swear on this life you have spared that I will do everything in my power to save the people of my homeland.
10164 : Once all is well, you must come and see the Far East for yourself.
10165 : Why can't you do such a simple thing!?
10166 : B-but, sir... He won't listen to a word I say!
10167 : I don't want to hear excuses! You are no longer of any use to me!
10168 : Hey, you. You'll do it.
10169 : Or else what? Or else you'll face the wrath of Metalworks management, and that means me!
10170 : Lately, there's been an unusual friar idling around the Temple of the Goddess. He's become a real nuisance.
10171 : Lately, there's been an unusual bard idling around the Temple of the Goddess. He's become a real nuisance.
10172 : I wouldn't want anything to happen to my...<cough>... Never mind.
10173 : Hm? You got somethin' you wanna say to me?
10174 : All right then. Anyway, don't do anything too funny, or the people of the Metalworks will start to distrust you...and more importantly, me! Now go send that friar packing!
10175 : Mumble jumble... O great Altana... O great Altana... Mumble grumble...
10176 : Ohhh, hello there! Come, let us pray to Altana together!
10177 : What a sinful lout you are! O great Altana, save this wretched soul!
10178 : Hey there. Find anything yet?
10179 : This place couldn't possibly get any fishier! I smell a rat!
10180 : Looks like we hit the nail right on the head.
10181 : Wooow! It's %! What are you doing herrre?
10182 : Hold it! Who's this?
10183 : You say you were ordered to chase this guy off? There's no need, though. He's a friend of mine.
10184 : Isn't that right, Miledo?
10185 : Ta-da!
10186 : Hee hee. Surprised? Anyway, it was Salim who told you to come here, wasn't it?
10187 : I knew it. You see, he's been receiving bribes from a merchant.
10188 : We've been aiming for a while now to take those bribes for ourselves, and our detective work led us to this temple. We think this is where he's got his stash hidden.
10189 : Miledo-Shiraddo is disguised as a friar to find out more.
10190 : The fact that Salim ordered you to chase him off makes it all the more suspicious...
10191 : The fact that Salim ordered you to chase him off makes it all the more suspicious...
10192 : And this proves it! There's a trap here!
10193 : The cat's out of the bag now! There must be a switch or two somewhere to deactivate it. Let's take a look around.
10194 : Think you could help us out, %? I don't think we can do it alone.
10195 : Think you could help us out? Three heads are even better than two!
10196 : Hey, it's you again! Relax, it's just me.
10197 : Surprise! I just thought a bard would be an interesting change.
10198 : Miledo, how is the trrrap now?
10199 : It hasn't changed a bit.
10200 : Oh, %. Thanks for earlier!
10201 : Think you could lend us a hand?
10202 : All right! Let's give Salim his just desserts!
10203 : By the way, I've brought seven helpful little goodies along with me, and I'm nice enough to let you use one.
10204 : Pick one. You'll need it!
10205 : Choose your weapon! Scope. Bard's harp. Lead Guardsman's ID. Snares. Lucky charm. Pocket watch. %.
10206 : Choose your weapon! Scope. Bard's harp. Lead Guardsman's ID. Snares. Lucky charm. Pocket watch. ???.
10207 : The guardsmen in this area are dressed as ordinary citizens, but the scope will allow you to see right through their disguises. Is this what you really want?
10208 : You can use the bard's harp to recall someone's past. Is this what you really want?
10209 : The lead guardsman's ID does just what its name implies--it identifies you as the lead guardsman! Is this what you really want?
10210 : You can lay the snares in various places and see what happens. Is this what you really want?
10211 : The lucky charm can be helpful when you're in a pinch. Is this what you really want?
10212 : The pocket watch is a must for the punctual adventurer. Is this what you really want?
10213 : The % will allow you to transform into a child, an elderly person, or a woman. Is this what you really want?
10214 : Sorry, but I don't think you're ready for that yet!
10215 : Really choose this item? My mind's made up! Then again, maybe not.
10216 : The snares! Excellent choice! Now all we have to do is decide where to lay them.
10217 : You can set as many as you want, but don't get greedy, or someone might notice! So, where do you want to lay the snares?
10218 : Pick a place to lay your traps. 1st floor - Near the kiln. 1st floor - Shop. 1st floor - Cermet Refinery. 1st floor - Metalworks replica. 2nd floor - Gunpowder Room. 2nd floor - Cid's Lab. Finished.
10219 : First floor, near the kiln. Gotcha.
10220 : First floor, in a shop. Gotcha.
10221 : First floor, in the Cermet Refinery. Gotcha.
10222 : First floor, in front of the Metalworks replica. Gotcha.
10223 : Second floor, in the Gunpowder Room. Gotcha.
10224 : Second floor, in Cid's Lab. Gotcha.
10225 : Is that it?
10226 : Okay! I'm off to lay the snares!
10227 : All done!
10228 : It is time, Miledo.
10229 : Gotcha! I'll go leave a letter for Salim now!
10230 : Before pulling off a job, we always leave a letter. It's our trrrademark.
10231 : The letter has been delivered!
10232 : Okay! You want to leave the letter this time?
10233 : You left it where Salim could find it, right?
10234 : It looks like Salim's been setting up guardsmen in the Metalworks lately, so be wary even if you think you've found something.
10235 : Even if they do find out what we're up to, we might be able to get away with it a second time. Any more than that, though, and we'll be forced to stalk away with our tails between our legs.
10236 : Oh, and one more thing. Don't set a paw outside of the Metalworks. I wanna have this wrrrapped up in short order.
10237 : If this is all too big a burden for you to handle, don't worry. Just come back here and we'll let you go on your merry way.
10238 : Okay, enough chat! Let's look for the switches and deactivate the trap!
10239 : You have one Earth hour to finish your task.
10240 : There appears to be a trap here.
10241 : Give up the quest? Yes. No.
10242 : You are no longer participating in the quest.
10243 : You have exceeded your time limit. You are no longer participating in the quest.
10244 : Ordering a guardsman to stand watch over the trap was a brilliant idea, even for me! Even the most cunning thief couldn't steal anything from there now.
10245 : I heard something I think I wasn't suppooosed to hear...
10246 : And I'm not gonna tell you!
10247 : I heard the manager mumbling about setting some kind of trap in the Temple of the Goddess. He also murmured something about pressing three switches in order, I think...
10248 : I'm pretty sure he said that you can make the trap go away by pressing the switches one at a time.
10249 : I'm pretty sure he said that you have to press just one of the switches twice.
10250 : I'm pretty sure he said that you have to press all of the switches twice.
10251 : I'm pretty sure he said that you have to press the switches eight times in all.
10252 : I'm pretty sure he said that you have to press the switches ten times in all.
10253 : I wonder what he's hiding there...
10254 : You want to know which order to press the switches in? Well, it really depends, but you might not want to leave a big switch for last. Small is the key!
10255 : You want to know which order to press the switches in? Well, it really depends, but I'm willing to bet that the biggest comes last!
10256 : You want to know which order to press the switches in? Well, it really depends, but you should probably save the medium-sized switch for last.
10257 : Switch order, you say? I think the smallest should be first.
10258 : Switch order, you say? I think the medium-sized switch should be first.
10259 : Switch order, you say? It may seem natural to start out small, but actually, the biggest switch comes first!
10260 : You wanna know which switch to press twice? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd pick me the most difficult switch to find!
10261 : You wanna know which switch to press twice? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd pick me the hardest switch to trigger!
10262 : You wanna know which switch to press twice? Well, here in the Metalworks, we almost always make switches so that you have to press 'em twice!
10263 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd press me the medium switch second and fifth!
10264 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd activate me the hardest switch to trigger second, and the hardest switch to find fifth!
10265 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd activate me the hardest switch to trigger second and fourth!
10266 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd activate me the hardest switch to find second, and the hardest switch to trigger fourth!
10267 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd press me a normal switch second, and the hardest switch to find fourth!
10268 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd press me the hardest switch to find second, and a normal switch fourth!
10269 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd activate me the hardest switch to trigger third and sixth!
10270 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd press me the same switch first and seventh!
10271 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd press me the same switch first and sixth!
10272 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd press me the hardest switch to find second, fourth, and seventh!
10273 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd activate me the hardest switch to trigger second, fourth, and fifth!
10274 : So you wanna know the switch order, do ya? Let's see here... Well, if I were you, I'd activate me a normal switch third and sixth!
10275 : What d'ya want? I don't support intergenerational friendship!
10276 : Switch order? Let's see here... Well, if it were me, I'd press me the same switch second, fourth, sixth, and last!
10277 : Switch order? Let's see here... Well, if it were me, I'd activate me the hardest switch to trigger second, fourth, sixth, and eighth!
10278 : Let's see here... Well, if it were me, I'd press me a normal switch second, sixth, and ninth!
10279 : Switch order? Let's see here... Well, if it were me, I'd press me the same switch second, fourth, sixth, and last!
10280 : Switch order? Let's see here... Well, if it were me, I'd press me the same switch second, sixth, and last!
10281 : My manager says we got a letter from a thief. Finally, some excitement around here!
10282 : I heard a thief was caught. I bet the thief's stuck in Salim's cell right about now. That place is locked up so tight, a tunnel worm couldn't burrow itself out.
10283 : Switch order? The smallest switch should be second.
10284 : Switch order? The medium-sized switch should be second.
10285 : Switch order? The largest switch should be second.
10286 : Switch order? The largest switch should be third.
10287 : Switch order? The largest switch should be second.
10288 : Switch order? The smallest switch should be second.
10289 : Switch order? The smallest switch should be third.
10290 : Switch order? The medium-sized switch should be third.
10291 : Switch order? The medium-sized switch should be second.
10292 : Switch order? The smallest switch should be pressed third and fourth.
10293 : Switch order? The medium-sized switch should be pressed third and fourth.
10294 : Switch order? The smallest switch should be pressed third and fifth.
10295 : Switch order? The medium-sized switch should be pressed third and fifth.
10296 : Switch order? The big switch should be activated third and fifth.
10297 : Switch order? The first and the fifth switches are the same...
10298 : And the second, fourth, seventh, and last switches are also identical.
10299 : Switch order? The second, sixth, and the last switches are the same...
10300 : And you should press the smallest switch third, fourth, and fifth.
10301 : Switch order? The second, seventh, and last switches are the same...
10302 : And the medium-sized switch should be pressed third, fourth, and fifth.
10303 : Switch order? The third, sixth, and last switches are the same...
10304 : And the first and fifth switches are also the same.
10305 : And the first and seventh switches are also the same.
10306 : Switch order? The first, fifth, and eighth switches are the same...
10307 : And the third, seventh, and ninth switches are also identical.
10308 : Switch order? The first, fifth, and last switches are the same...
10309 : And the smallest switch should be pressed third, seventh, and ninth.
10310 : And the smallest switch should be pressed third, fourth, seventh, and eighth.
10311 : Switch order? The first, fifth, and eighth switches are the same.
10312 : And the medium-sized switch should be pressed third, seventh, and ninth.
10313 : Switch order? The first, fifth, and ninth switches are the same.
10314 : And the medium-sized switch should be pressed third, fourth, seventh, and eighth.
10315 : The thieves are sure to come here. Planning to take Salim's treasure... Hmph, what a low thing to do. Just wait until I lay my hands on them.
10316 : Think a thief will really come here? Salim's more of a worrywart than I thought. I'd like to hurry up and catch someone, though, so I can go out and enjoy a drink or two...or three...
10317 : There's a guardsman here. Got a plan?
10318 : What will you do? Leave it to Luto. Leave it to Miledo. Say something clever.
10319 : What will you do? Leave it to Luto. Leave it to Miledo. Say something clever. Use the bard's harp.
10320 : What will you do? Leave it to Luto. Leave it to Miledo. Say something clever. Use the lead guardsman's ID.
10321 : What will you do? Leave it to Luto. Leave it to Miledo. Say something clever. Use the lucky charm.
10322 : What will you do? Leave it to Luto. Leave it to Miledo-Shiraddo. Make a clever excuse. Use the %.
10323 : Rrroger. Just leave it to me.
10324 : I stole your trrreasure! Come and get it!
10325 : Hey, a thief! I'll get you!
10326 : All clear! Let's hurry and search the area.
10327 : Hey, there's a small switch here!
10328 : Hey, there's a switch here!
10329 : Miledo-Shiraddo presses the switch.
10330 : Hey, there's a lever here!
10331 : Here too!
10332 : And here!
10333 : Umph!
10334 : Oomph!
10335 : They won't budge!
10336 : Same here...
10337 : Maybe you have to pull all three at once...
10338 : %, come help us. Let's try this out.
10339 : You come help us, too. Let's try this out.
10340 : Ready, set...go!
10341 : % pulls the lever.
10342 : Hm? What was that? ...Ah, whatever.
10343 : Hey! Who are you!?
10344 : Yiiiaaah!!!
10345 : Whew...well, that didn't work out as planned.
10346 : Where is Miledo-Shiraddo?
10347 : What!? He got captured? We've gotta rrrescue him!
10348 : Maybe someone around here knows where he was taken. Let's ask around.
10349 : He got captured again!? I'll take carrre of him later. Looks like our plans have failed. I think we had better give up for now.
10350 : You can count on me!
10351 : Check it out! Nobody'll be able to tell the difference!
10352 : Yeah yeah, just get out there already.
10353 : You got it!
10354 : Yo, time to switch shifts.
10355 : I've been waiting for you. I'm starving! Later.
10356 : What? My shift isn't over yet...
10357 : Oh. Sorry about that. I've never been good with time.
10358 : Wait right there! There's something very odd about you... Is there something you're hiding?
10359 : Aiiieee!!!
10360 : Whew, that was close. We really screwed that up...
10361 : Hey, where's Luto?
10362 : She was captured!? We've got to save her!
10363 : Maybe someone knows where she was taken. Let's split up and ask around!
10364 : She was captured again!? I'll just have to help her later. It looks like we failed this time.
10365 : Hey you! What are you doing over there!?
10366 : Gotta think up a good excuse... Waiting for a friend. Checking out the Metalworks.
10367 : You want to meet a friend in a place like this? You must be up to no good!
10368 : Really? The Metalworks is sure to impress your friend. Take your time.
10369 : You must be a new recruit of the Blacksmiths' Guild! Good luck!
10370 : Checking it out? For what? You've got guilt written all over your face!
10371 : Your plan of action? Chat. Use the scope.
10372 : Looks like this civilian is the rrreal deal. Striking up a chat should cause no problems.
10373 : Yep, that's Salim, all right. You can talk to him, but you better watch your mouth. No telling what that guy will do.
10374 : (He looks like a guardsman. It's probably best not to talk to him.)
10375 : You want information on the trap set in the Temple of the Goddess? You must be thieves!
10376 : What? You want me to deactivate the trap in the Temple of the Goddess? Are you thieves or something!?
10377 : So there really are guardsmen dressed in civilian clothing! We should step lightly around here.
10378 : Even I couldn't see through the disguise... We had better take care when talking to people.
10379 : Wha--!?
10380 : Hey you! Just what do you think you're looking at!?
10381 : The nerve of some people!
10382 : Here ya go! Galkan sausage for you
10383 : Oh how I've waited for this! The texture, the enticing aroma... I can't bear it any longer...!
10384 : Taru-watching is not a sport! Got it?
10385 : You again!? Get a hold of yourself!
10386 : Oh, I get it. I'm just the sexiest darn Taru you've ever seen, rightaru? Still, this is the first time I've had such an aggressive stalker!
10387 : I'm going to complain to the manager. Prepare yourself!
10388 : You'll recall my past in song? What're you going to sing for me?
10389 : Sing about what? Promotion day. Bitter rivalry. Thief-catching.
10390 : Oh yes, I remember now. I got promoted on my birthday... That was the best present ever...
10391 : You just made my day. Thanks!
10392 : You receive 10 gil!
10393 : Oh yes, I remember now. There was this guy who was always competing with me...
10394 : B-but, but...then he got into that terrible accident and... He was so young...<sob>...
10395 : Oh, I can't be seen in public like this. I'm going to go lie down for a while...
10396 : Oh yes, I remember now. I caught this thief, you see, and...
10397 : Wait a minute! Y-you're a thief!
10398 : Sing about what? Childhood memories. Lead guardsman's lectures. Recent happy times.
10399 : That's right. Everything I did resulted in failure...and I was bullied something awful...
10400 : Stop it already! I don't want to remember any more!
10401 : That's right. He lectured me and showed me my weaknesses. From that day forward, I resigned to do a better job and...
10402 : Hey! You're awfully suspicious! You're a thief, aren't you!?
10403 : That's right. Just the other day, I went fishing and pulled up this gigantic fish! Then I fried it and ate it right there, and...
10404 : Ah, my stomach's growling just thinking about it. It was fun talking to you. Thanks!
10405 : What beautiful music... Impressive...
10406 : You know, you could become a bard, too...
10407 : Oh, you're right! I want to become a bard!
10408 : A splendid idea! You should begin by changing your appearance.
10409 : That tone! It was marvelous! I also desire a harp... No doubt they cost a fortune, though...
10410 : Would you give up on a dream just because of money?
10411 : Of course not! I shall buy a harp!
10412 : I wonder if I could sing like that, too...
10413 : Well, why don't you give it a try?
10414 : Oh, right! Here I go! ...Lalalala...<cough>...
10415 : Do re mi fa so la ti... Do re mi fa so la ti... ...Do!
10416 : Those high notes are a little rough...
10417 : [Sir/Madam] Bard, I am here thanks to you!
10418 : I can recognize you regardless of appearances! You give off your own unique musical aura!
10419 : I will go to Salim now and sing of his memories. He shall have the honor of being the subject of my very first piece!
10420 : Some day I will even sing your memories...
10421 : What are you saying? How rude of you! What a fool!
10422 : Oh, right! I am very sorry!
10423 : Please wish me luck!
10424 : Th-that card...! Boss, I await your orders!
10425 : What are your orders? Take a break. Guard another spot. Call all guards together. How is Salim doing?
10426 : Thank you, but I need no rest!
10427 : Last I saw him, Salim was wondering when thieves would show up!
10428 : Ummm...where is it that I should guard, again?
10429 : Ummm...how many guardsmen are there, again?
10430 : Hey! Thieves!!!
10431 : I'll go find out!
10432 : Understood!
10433 : I didn't realize we had another lead guardsman.
10434 : I won't let [him/her] show me up!
10435 : Hmph, not [him/her] again... The guards listen to [him/her] more than me!
10436 : My guardsman resume is a mile long! I can do a much better job, so that newbie better not get smug!
10437 : The...the guards don't l-listen to my orders anymore...
10438 : Am I so useless as lead guardsman? Maybe I'm just not cut out for this kind of work...
10439 : [Sir/Ma'am], I've decided to quit being a lead guardsman. I'm sure you will do just fine on your own. Good luck.
10440 : What!? There's a snare here!
10441 : My feet are bound... I can't move!
10442 : Whoa, there's a snare here!
10443 : Whew, that was close!
10444 : Ouch!
10445 : That hurt! What is this, anyway!? Who would put such a thing here?
10446 : Again!? This could hurt somebody! We can't have something like this just lying around.
10447 : ...I can't remove it, though. It looks like I'll need some special device to get rid of it.
10448 : Damn, this is the third time!
10449 : I bet I can get rid of it with this, though!
10450 : ...Or maybe not.
10451 : Salim isn't here either?
10452 : Hey, you. You should be careful walking around the Metalworks. There are snares lying all over the place!
10453 : I better hurry and let Salim know about this.
10454 : It's showtime!
10455 : Sir, do you think that thieves will really show up?
10456 : We got a letter from them, didn't we? They'll be here, all right, so don't slack off.
10457 : I'll go stand guard by the kiln.
10458 : I'll go stand guard in the Cermet Refinery.
10459 : I'll go stand guard in front of the Metalworks replica.
10460 : So, even the lead guardsman's getting involved. He'll be tough to get arrround.
10461 : Let's just avoid him at all costs.
10462 : It's the lead guardsman! What should we do?
10463 : Sir, how's about a rest? You can leave this place to me.
10464 : I told the guards not to bother me! You must be a fake!
10465 : I think I'll stand guard by the kiln next.
10466 : I think I'll stand guard in the Cermet Refinery next.
10467 : I think I'll stand guard in front of the Metalworks replica next.
10468 : Ahahaha! How does it feel to be at the mercy of the lead guardsman?
10469 : % grips the lucky charm tightly.
10470 : Nothing happens.
10471 : Hmmm, the area by the kiln hasn't been very well guarded as of late. I think I'll go try there instead.
10472 : Hmmm, the Cermet Refinery hasn't been very well guarded as of late. I think I'll go try there instead.
10473 : Hmmm, the area in front of the Metalworks replica hasn't been very well guarded as of late. I think I'll go try there instead.
10474 : Perfect! Let's check the area now!
10475 : (There's something fishy about this lucky charm... I smell a rat...a rat...a rat? No...it's more like...gold. Gold? I smell gold!)
10476 : (Hmmm, maybe I should try selling this lucky charm here...)
10477 : (But wait... I wonder what's inside of it. Hmmm...)
10478 : (I did some research on lucky charms, and learned that they often contain gold.)
10479 : (Even if there's only 1 gil inside, I couldn't bring myself to sell it to anyone! Hmmm, I wonder what I should put inside the lucky charm in its place...)
10480 : (I filled the lucky charm with a lot of things to replace the gold...rocks, herbs, metal, a few strands of my hair...)
10481 : (But something's missing... What could it be?)
10482 : (...I've got it!)
10483 : The lucky charm was missing something to connect it to the Goddess! All charms have some kind of divine symbol on them, right?
10484 : Now then, all I have to do is draw a likeness of the Goddess on it. And here we go!
10485 : I should be an artist! This is perfect!
10486 : Now all that's left is to go peddle this off to Salim!
10487 : That Salim is a slave driver! I don't think I'll have a free moment for the rest of my life!
10488 : He harassed me something awful about setting up that trap in the Temple of the Goddess. It's not like anyone would find out, anyway!
10489 : I think times like that prove he's a lot more cowardly than he tries to act!
10490 : Why do I have to search for some thief, anyway? I'm a merchant, for cryin' out loud!
10491 : I think that guy just can't get his facts straight. He keeps asking me to do all these things that are completely unrelated to my job. Geesh...
10492 : Salim is asking for more gold again! He should think about other people for once.
10493 : Anyway, if I don't hurry and meet today's quota, he'll string me up!
10494 : Whew, I met today's quota on time somehow. Salim should be happy with this.
10495 : I can't go on like this every day, though, especially with these inflated prices. Next time I'll try and talk to Salim about it.
10496 : What will you do? Chat. Use the %.
10497 : What do you want?
10498 : Which will you use? Knitted cap. Spectacles. Silver heels.
10499 : Dirty thieves... I'll see through anything you try to pull!
10500 : It's Salim. This could get ugly.
10501 : It's not like a thief to just come right out in the open. You must be a decoy!
10502 : Sir, how's about a rest? You can leave this place to me.
10503 : I told the guards not to bother me! You must be a fake!
10504 : Me? A fake? That's crazy! Um, I just remembered an important appointment I have to make! Later!
10505 : Meeting a friend? What a sorry excuse! Surely you can think of something better than that!
10506 : Checking the place out? You don't look like a craftsman to me! Surely you can think of something better than that!
10507 : Pabro! What are you doing here?
10508 : Don't worry, Son, I'm not angry with you. If you want Papa to show you around, I'll give you the grand tour!
10509 : Want to go eat some yummy food? You've always been a picky eater, so I wonder where we should go...
10510 : No, no, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings! Everyone has their likes and dislikes, right? What would you like, Son? Papa'll give you the world!
10511 : Erba! What are you doing here? Is your mom here too?
10512 : Don't worry, Daughter, I'm not angry with you. Papa's just worried for your safety because you are such a cute little girl!
10513 : Want to go buy some new clothes? Surely you're tired of your old clothes by now.
10514 : No, no, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings! Your old clothes looked very nice on you! Come on, sweetie-pie, let's go buy some more!
10515 : Dad! What are you doing here?
10516 : No, never mind about that! Dad, I've missed you so!
10517 : My supervisor got upset with me again, Dad! I can't take it anymore. My life is so rough!
10518 : How is Mom? Let's go somewhere quiet so you can tell me all about her!
10519 : Mom! What are you doing here?
10520 : No, never mind about that! I'm just happy you came to see me!
10521 : Mom, I want to taste your cooking again! The food Ulrica makes is just awful. There's nothing like my own mom's homemade meals!
10522 : How is Dad? Let's go somewhere quiet so you can tell me all about him!
10523 : Ulrica! What are you doing here?
10524 : Where are the kids? Don't tell me you left them at home all alone! What would you do if something were to happen to them?
10525 : Don't bother me while I'm working! Hurry up and go back home!
10526 : There you are! Hey, Salim!
10527 : Hm? Who are you?
10528 : I'm Bumimi the adventurer. I think you should know that there's a stalker wandering around the Metalworks!
10529 : A stalker?
10530 : Yes, a stalker! [He/She] keeps following me around and watching me! Arrest [him/her]! Arrest [him/her] nooow!
10531 : I don't think there's anything I can do about that...
10532 : Oh, you didn't just say that!!! You're supposed to be watching over the Metalworks! Everything that happens here is your responsibility!
10533 : I have found you, Sir Salim!
10534 : Greetings! A humble bard, at your service!
10535 : That's it! You must be humble! That must be the key!
10536 : You're right! Now I can be a great bard!
10537 : Hurry up and tell me what you want. I'm busy.
10538 : Oh, yes! Sir Salim, I have come to recall your memories in song!
10539 : My memories? No thanks!
10540 : Wh-why? Why do you not desire to hear my song? Please! Please allow me to sing!
10541 : Salim...
10542 : Oh, it's you! Did you catch the thief?
10543 : Hey, it's the lead guardsman!
10544 : What are you saying? I thought you were the lead guardsman!
10545 : No... This person here is much better suited for the job than I am. I'm quitting.
10546 : Huh!?
10547 : There you are. Salim!
10548 : Oh, hi, Ghemp. Is something wrong?
10549 : I can't make any sense of it. There are these odd snares all over the Metalworks. What are all those about?
10550 : S-snares? I don't know what you're talking about!
10551 : Anyway, please get rid of them. A man could get seriously injured just walking around!
10552 : I told you, I don't know what you're talking about! None of the other craftsmen have mentioned anything like that!
10553 : They've probably just been lucky enough not to stumble into one of them. You better fix the problem before somebody gets hurt.
10554 : H-how dare you order me around! I-I'm the manager here, you know!
10555 : (Ohoho. I've found you, Salim.)
10556 : Unfortunately, I'm an atheist.
10557 : No matter! You are a very fortunate man! If you act now, you can still receive the blessings of the Goddess with this lucky charm!
10558 : I have a charm that'll make you filthy rich, another for increasing your chances for promotion, one for a happy romance, and last but not least, one for luck in general! So how about it?
10559 : Get lost.
10560 : There you are, Salim.
10561 : Oh, hi. Did you do what I asked?
10562 : About that...do you think we could stop raising prices after this?
10563 : What?
10564 : Yeah, well, um...I'm wearing down at this rate, you see...
10565 : I can just pretend we've never done business together, if you like. I have a lot of others I can work with instead.
10566 : B-but...all I want is to slow down the pace a little...
10567 : I don't know about your worries, but I've got enough on my own plate as is. If you can't comply with my needs...
10568 : Wait just a moment! So you've got a lot of work to worry about, do you? That means you do need me, doesn't it?
10569 : Whatever.
10570 : Hurry up and catch the stalker!
10571 : Let me sing of your memories!
10572 : I want to quit my job as lead guardsman...
10573 : Get rid of the snares!
10574 : You need to buy a lucky charm!
10575 : I'm counting on you!
10576 : Salim!
10577 : What d'you guys think I am, some kind of superhero? Asking me to help with this and that... You guys think of nothing but yourselves!
10578 : I'm a busy man! Don't get in my way! Go home, all of you!
10579 : I'm tired... Just leave me alone.
10580 : Salim... Why don't you go home and take a rest?
10581 : Home...? Hahaha, go home and rest?
10582 : I have a wife and two kids, but...
10583 : ...Nah, they're a great family.
10584 : My wife is an excellent cook, even better than my mother.
10585 : My son Pabro isn't picky and scarfs down whatever my wife makes for him.
10586 : My daughter Erba is unselfish and treasures the things she has, even the clothes she owns. Hahaha! My family is great!
10587 : Hey, you.
10588 : Me?
10589 : Of course he's talking to you. What do you think?
10590 : Oh...oh!
10591 : Y-yes? What?
10592 : Sing of his memories.
10593 : Y-yes, sir!
10594 : Groudinguet begins to sing of the first time the lead guardsman stood on duty.
10595 : Wow, I used to be so different! That was so long ago... I miss those days...
10596 : Salim, do you think I can stick around a little longer?
10597 : Of course.
10598 : You wanted me to catch the stalker, right? Just leave it to me.
10599 : Really? Thank you!
10600 : I changed someone's life with my song! There is no greater joy than this!
10601 : Now, whose memories I should recall next...?
10602 : Hey, you were selling lucky charms, right? Do you have anything I could use to protect me?
10603 : Why yes, of course! You can have the charm for luck in general! That should protect you against anything!
10604 : I'll take one, then!
10605 : Oh yes, I forgot to mention it, but the general luck charm will only take effect when in possession of the other three charms.
10606 : What? Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?
10607 : O-of course not! The general luck charm is splenderiffic stuff, created by the casting of countless incantations!
10608 : I see. Well, I don't want to be troubled by that stalker again, that's for sure! I'll take them all.
10609 : A wise decision! No harm could possibly befall you now!
10610 : (Whew, that was close... I think I'm about through with pretending to be a friar!)
10611 : (That merchant looks like he wants to work out some kind of deal with Salim. Maybe next time, I should make a manual for doing smart business and sell it to that guy...)
10612 : (Hm...I wonder how I should tell Salim what I want to say...)
10613 : (That craftsman was saying he wanted the snares removed. Salim would definitely be in a spot if his trap in the Temple of the Goddess was taken along with them.)
10614 : Salim, if you refuse, I'll have to remove the trap from the Temple of the Goddess.
10615 : It was awfully hard to get it there, wasn't it? Without that, stealing something out of that room would be a piece of cake!
10616 : Y-you...!
10617 : You'll remove the snares? Thank you! But they aren't in the Temple of the Goddess. They're over there!
10618 : What?
10619 : Over here! Follow me!
10620 : B-but...
10621 : Well, that should solve everything! Problems fixed with a single command. I'm a genius!
10622 : Ahahaha!
10623 : The first switch has been deactivated.
10624 : The second switch has been deactivated.
10625 : The third switch has been deactivated.
10626 : The fourth switch has been deactivated.
10627 : The fifth switch has been deactivated.
10628 : The sixth switch has been deactivated.
10629 : The seventh switch has been deactivated.
10630 : The eighth switch has been deactivated.
10631 : The ninth switch has been deactivated.
10632 : You hear a noise from the direction of the Temple of the Goddess.
10633 : I found Salim's key lying around, but that guy scares me. Could you return it to him for me?
10634 : I saw a guardsman giving someone a key to the cell! Don't tell anyone!
10635 : What did the person he gave it to look like? I don't remember!
10636 : I think I saw something I shouldn't have seen.
10637 : Who'd the guardsman give the cell key to?
10638 : That'd have to be Hungry Wolf. Those two're like peas in a pod!
10639 : That'd have to be Darha. Those two're like peas in a pod!
10640 : That'd have to be Striking Snake. Those two're like peas in a pod!
10641 : Cell key? I don't have any cell key.
10642 : You want to borrow it? You should have said so in the first place.
10643 : No problem. And don't you worry about me.
10644 : Cell key? I don't recall any cell key.
10645 : You want me to lend it to you? You've got guilt written all over your face, and you know I'm going to refuse, anyway.
10646 : I don't need your thanks. Just hurry and go.
10647 : Cell key? Was I given a cell key? I don't remember.
10648 : You want me to lend it to you? Well, I like you, so I'll do it.
10649 : Just don't tell anybody.
10650 : Did you find any new information?
10651 : I see you've got the cell key. Perrrfect timing. I've just discovered the location of the cell. Hand the key over.
10652 : We don't want to stand out, so I'll bust him out myself.
10653 : Yay, I'm free! Thank you!
10654 : Let's get back to deactivating the trap. This time, don't get caught!
10655 : Any new info?
10656 : You got the cell key! Perfect timing. I've just discovered the location of the cell. Give me the key!
10657 : We don't want to stand out, so I'll go get her out myself.
10658 : Thank you for rrrescuing me!
10659 : Let's go back and deactivate the trap now. Don't get caught this time!
10660 : We did it! The trap shouldn't spring now.
10661 : Thanks to you, everything went according to plan. Until we meet again...
10662 : Thanks to you, everything went according to plan. Until we meet again...
10663 : And now to enjoy my reward!
10664 : Luto! Don't hog the treasure!
10665 : How could this be!? The trap is broken!
10666 : What's this? There's a letter here...
10667 : Thanks for the treasure! -Luto Mewrilah and Miledo-Shiraddo
10668 : Thanks for the treasure! -Luto Mewrilah, Miledo-Shiraddo, and %
10669 : Why do I get the feeling that their numbers are increasing?
10670 : Whaaat!? They stole my gold! Just wait'll I get my hands on them! Where in hell were the guardsmen when this happened?
10671 : What do you want?
10672 : You chased off the friar? Who gives a damn! I just wanted my gold, and now it's gone!
10673 : I have my pride, though. Here, take this and consider yourself thanked.
10674 : ...My money...<sigh>...
10675 : It looks like Salim has left something here...
10676 : %'s badge flashes brightly.
10677 : Why do I have to keep groveling for my ungrateful boss? It's not fair!
10678 : Ah, I wish I could fly away to some faraway land...
10679 : Look sharp, maggot! Huh? What's that medal you've got there? You an officer dispatched from some foreign land, squirt? Well!?
10680 : You're not? Well, how the hell am I supposed to know!?
10681 : Chief Cid has nothing to say about that nation...
10682 : I'm sure that everywhere stars can be seen gleaming in the night sky, there are legends related to them.
10683 : I wonder what kind of stories are told in faraway lands...
10684 : Hm? You want to know if I'm interested in becoming a mercenary?
10685 : Don't make me laugh.
10686 : My duties as a Mythril Musketeer are far more important than such frivolity.
10687 : We are all Altana's children. There must be some way to avoid this conflict with Aht Urhgan.
10688 : I hope the council will discover a peaceful solution...
10689 : Greetings, adventurer. I am Gold Musketeer first captain, Helga. Would you like me to give you a simple briefing on the Republican military?
10690 : Listen in? Yes. No.
10691 : Ah, I suppose you are already an expert on the subject. My apologies.
10692 : The Republican military is comprised of two groups: the Republican Legion and the Musketeers.
10693 : The legionary forces are formed from volunteers and draftees, and are divided into four different organizations. It is these organizations that handle the responsibility of defending our nation from invasion.
10694 : The musketeers are an elite group of officers hand-selected from legion ranks. As with the legion, this group is also divided into several smaller units.
10695 : Of those units, the two most prominent would be the Iron Musketeers, who answer directly to the Department of Industry, and the Gold Musketeers, who take their orders from the Department of Mining.
10696 : Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those [San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!
10697 : Congratulations on your victory, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!
10698 : Where would like to go, kupo? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
10699 : Happy travels, kupo!
10700 : Moogles from across Vana'diel have heard of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!
10701 : Oooh! It's %! Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!
10702 : ***GM Commands*** ***Use with CAUTION!***
10703 : Set this area's A flag to: Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
10704 : Switch on this area's B flag? No (OFF). Yes (ON).
10705 : Flag settings complete. A Flag: [Nowhere/San/Bas/Win] B Flag: [OFF/ON]
10706 : Hm? What are you doing here? I thought I told you to go to the palace in Jeuno.
10707 : What am I still doing here? Well...you see I...I still have some cleaning up to do...
10708 : Why are you here in Bastok? Have you turned down your place in the Wajaoam Infiltration Operation?
10709 : Well, that's your choice. Me? I was collared for extra duties when I came back to pick something up...
10710 : What are doing here? I thought I ordered you to continue the mission with the King of Hearts?
10711 : I wouldn't worry about the other members of the team--their wounds are serious, but stable. It's a miracle anyone survived that crash...
10712 : I heard about the Endymion incident from Naji. What kind of cannon could unleash that kind of destruction...?
10713 : This is confidential information, but I hear an allied force is assembling in Jeuno to invade the Empire in retaliation for the Endymion...
10714 : A fleet of airships will be making a lightning assault on Al Zahbi. I wish I could help you, but I've been ordered to assist with the preparations...
10715 : The allied fleet has returned to Port Jeuno. Your actions have prevented unspeakable bloodshed on both sides.
10716 : Huh, so that light was actually the power of Alexander. I can't believe we survived something like that...
10717 : You see that new cook they have?
10718 : The poor sod. Any time anything goes wrong, they blame it on him.
10719 : Look, here we go again.
10720 : You burned another pie? Not paying attention, were you?
10721 : It wasn't my pie, Miss Aileen...
10722 : Wasn't your pie? Then whose pie was it? Do you see any other apprentice cooks in here?
10723 : I've warned you time and time again...
10724 : You've earned yourself garbage disposal and dishwashing duties for a month, mister.
10725 : It's a harsh punishment, but you've got to learn.
10726 : It really wasn't his fault, you know.
10727 : I was watching the whole time. That pie was put in the oven by the other cook...
10728 : What're you doing? Don't go sticking your nose into that mess!
10729 : Yes? You have something to say to me?
10730 : Have something to say? A whole mouthful. Ah...maybe not...
10731 : Hmph, who asked you? Look at those hands--you've never baked a pie in your life. What gives you the right to tell me how to run my kitchen?
10732 : Hmph, maybe you've baked a few pies in your time, but I'll run my kitchen any way I see fit. Keep your opinions to yourself.
10733 : Then you can march yourself back the way you came.
10734 : Aileen, you shouldn't speak to the customers in that tone...
10735 : So you think I should just stand here and have some outsider tell me how to run my business, Anneliese!?
10736 : Of course not, but--
10737 : Hmph, I'm surrounded by incompetence.
10738 : Talentless apprentices and spineless chefs... How am I supposed to create culinary delicacies under these conditions?
10739 : Now you've done it. I hope this place is still open for business tomorrow...
10740 : Thanks for sticking up for me, [sir/ma'am]. I'm sorry you had to feel the edge of Miss Aileen's tongue...
10741 : It certainly is a sharp one.
10742 : I apologize for her outburst. You didn't deserve to be treated like that.
10743 : She's seen some hard times and never quite recovered.
10744 : You see, Aileen had this childhood friend during the time of the Great War...
10745 : But one day, her friend apparently left town without a word to Aileen.
10746 : Aileen spent days waiting under a tree by the river in the Bastok Markets for her friend to appear. She wouldn't accept the fact that her companion had simply abandoned her.
10747 : As you can guess, Aileen never saw the girl again.
10748 : She acts as if the disappearance of her friend doesn't bother her, but it's obvious she was deeply hurt.
10749 : Of course, that doesn't excuse her terrible manners towards a customer.
10750 : Up until now I've just closed my eyes to her behavior. Perhaps that wasn't the wisest course...
10751 : I never knew Miss Aileen had such a sad story behind that temper...
10752 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. I'm glad to see you weren't scared away. Hm? You want me to give this to Miss Aileen?
10753 : What are you doing, chatting with customers? We still have that huge order from the blacksmith's guild to cook up.
10754 : I wasn't chatting, Miss Aileen. [He/She] wanted you to have this...
10755 : Hey, aren't you the [guy/lady] who likes to interfere with my business? Is this some sort of peace offering?
10756 : What? You say this is from Karla?
10757 : How...how did you know about her?
10758 : So, she was on her way to Lahnefeld...
10759 : ...
10760 : How could I have ever doubted poor Karla...?
10761 : I just took it for granted that she would always be there to play with me. I never thanked her...
10762 : I'm sure the time you spent with Karla was just as important to her as it was to you.
10763 : Why else would she bring you such a pretty gift?
10764 : I-I'm sorry... Please mind the counter.
10765 : She'll be off to sit under that tree in the markets, I'd imagine. It must be heartbreaking to hear the truth after all these years.
10766 : Oh, I've gone and cried into my rolanberry pies--they'll taste sour now. Miss Aileen will be so angry...
10767 : Hello, I'm the new apprentice cook, Leonhardt. I look forward to meeting all your dining needs.
10768 : It looks like that apprentice has finally been accepted by the other chefs. Now I can eat my meals in peace!
10769 : There's not much call for it with the current peace, but they sang songs about my feats of cannonry out in Batallia Downs back in the day.
10770 : I wish I had a chance to show you I can do more than just stand around in a big, round room...
10771 : Did I ever meet a ghost in the mountains of Grauberg?
10772 : What do you know about that?
10773 : Well, now that you mention it, I did once meet someone who apparently learned of my father's last words from a ghost.
10774 : But it was all just an act by the soldiers in the outpost. And I fell for it--hook, line, and sinker.
10775 : I discovered the truth the next time I was deployed to Grauberg and stumbled across a script one of the soldiers must have dropped.
10776 : Was I furious? Well, ordinarily I would be, except...
10777 : I understood that it was their way of helping out people like me--to help me overcome my loss.
10778 : Oh, and this play even had a title--Message on the Wind. I thought I would laugh up my bootlaces.
10779 : The play even had a title--Message on the Wind. I thought I would laugh up my bootlaces.
10780 : You have business with me?
10781 : Did I learn swordfighting from Elder Werei when I was younger?
10782 : That's right. Everything he taught me has become like second nature to me now.
10783 : He often said, The river has many branches, but they all flow into the sea.
10784 : You want me to tell you about the time during the Great War when Elder Werei instructed me in swordfighting?
10785 : I once imparted to you the teachings of my master--Only you can decide which roads in life you will tread.
10786 : He also taught me, The river has many branches, but they all flow into the sea.
10787 : I was too young to understand the meaning behind those words at the time. But now that I've been through my fair share of trials, I understand them all too well...
10788 : Hm? Did my master have any particular place he preferred to be?
10789 : Now that you mention it, he and Gumbah often used to travel to Grauberg.
10790 : What was it about that mountain...?
10791 : Yes? You need something? I've no time for idle chitchat.
10792 : Son of a hexagun! Are those %? What in the Goddess's name are you doing with those?
10793 : I see, I see. Bullets to blast through magic armor, you say?
10794 : You wouldn't happen to be lookin' for something like the old % they used back in the Great War, would you?
10795 : Ahh...stirs up memories in this old Galka's soul, it does. After the war ended, I never thought I'd hear the name again.
10796 : Goddess only knows what you'd want with those old things...but yes, I think I could do it for you. There's just one catch. The casting process requires some rather...rare...ingredients.
10797 : % and %, to be exact.
10798 : Provide me with what I need, and the job is as good as done.
10799 : Where to find them, you ask? I haven't a clue. They say there was once a plentiful supply in North Gustaberg, but it was exhausted completely by the war's end...
10800 : Provide me with the materials I need, and your job is as good as done.
10801 : Where to find them...? I haven't a clue. I hear they used to be plentiful in North Gustaberg, but the supply was surely exhausted years ago...
10802 : Oh ho, well look at this! It seems I underestimated you. Well, a promise is a promise...one order of beastman-blasting bullets, coming right up!
10803 : Good craftsmanship takes time, but I'll be done before you know it. Why don't you head to the Markets and try to catch yourself a gold carp or two while you wait?
10804 : Don't you know better than to rush a master at work? Just a bit longer, I say!
10805 : I was wondering when you'd come back. Here you are, one order of %, just like we used to make 'em!
10806 : I even took the liberty of making a few improvements to the old recipe. One blast from these and even the most potent magical armor will be reduced to little more than scrap metal.
10807 : My fee? Hah! Don't mention it! I haven't enjoyed my work this much in years. If you come across any other curiosities, you know where to find me!
10808 : Press button to proceed.
10809 : Greetings, friend. I am Registrar Cloud Walker. My duty is to issue marriage certificates to married couples.
10810 : What can I do for you today?
10811 : The marriage certificate is a legal document issued in recognition of the matrimony of two individuals. It can also be used as a wall decoration for your Mog House.
10812 : Couples wishing to receive the certificate must show proof of their marriage, and this can be done in a number of ways.
10813 : The couple should form a party while the husband is wearing his matrimony ring, and his wife, her matrimony band. After that, speak to me, and I'll draw up the certificates for you.
10814 : But if you possess a wedding ring, the procedure can be completed on your own.
10815 : Keep in mind though, that you can't have more than one certificate at any given time. Also, the nation of issuance for your certificate must be the same as your partner's.
10816 : One last thing. A misplaced certificate can be reissued, but only by the same officiating body that you originally received it from.
10817 : A wedding is a joyful occasion in which two souls brought together by fate are joined as partners in life.
10818 : In Bastok, it's customary for the bride and groom to swear an oath of endless love in the presence of witnesses. After which, wedding rings are exchanged.
10819 : To conclude the proceedings, all those present join in a toast with bottles of grape juice in hand and share in the newly joined couple's happiness.
10820 : First of all, you'll need to prepare wedding rings--a matrimony ring and a matrimony band, to be precise.
10821 : As their synthesis requires rare, hard-to-find ingredients, there truly is no better token of undying devotion between two people.
10822 : Before you present the ring to your partner, you should consider engraving your name onto it using a cyclone crystal. This practice is widespread among adventurers nowadays.
10823 : You'll also find that benedight coats and wedding dresses are popular as ceremonial attire for men and women, respectively.
10824 : Similar garments exist that can be synthesized. Whether you perform the synthesis yourself or employ a friend to do so, though, is entirely your decision. Gathering the needed ingredients can be pricey, but it's for this reason they're highly valued.
10825 : There's no need to feel dejected, though, if they don't fall within your budget. There's no law dictating what couples have to wear at their own wedding, after all.
10826 : If you have trouble obtaining any of the ceremonial items I've mentioned, they can also be purchased from the chests you see here.
10827 : Fireworks, wedding bells, and the like are also available to help add flavor to your special day, so feel free to purchase whatever you need.
10828 : It looks like you already have a marriage certificate in your possession. I'm afraid I'm not authorized to issue you another.
10829 : Your current job level must be level # or higher if you wish to receive a marriage certificate.
10830 : I'm afraid I'm not authorized to issue you a marriage certificate.
10831 : Married couples wishing to receive marriage certificates should form a party while the husband is wearing his matrimony ring, and his wife, her matrimony band. After that, speak to an official in charge, and the certificates will be drawn up for you.
10832 : It looks like you've already been issued a marriage certificate by another nation. A misplaced certificate can be reissued, but only by the same officiating body that you originally received it from.
10833 : It looks like your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation.
10834 : It looks like your spouse's marriage certificate was issued by another nation. If you want one of your own, you'll have to speak with the same officiating body that issued your spouse's.
10835 : Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another. Also, the nation of issuance for your marriage certificate must be the same as your partner's.
10836 : Accepting a marriage certificate from our nation will render you ineligible to receive one from another.
10837 : By the power vested in me by the Republic of Bastok, I hereby pronounce you husband and wife.
10838 : You are all now officially permitted to eat, drink, sing, and have a joyous night!
10839 : What would you like to do? Nothing. Request a marriage certificate. Learn about marriage certificates. Learn about wedding ceremonies. Learn about ceremonial items.
10840 : Have a marriage certificate issued? Yes. No.
10841 : It appears your better half has made a change. Please restart the process.
10842 : An assortment of celebratory goods is available for purchase.
10843 : An assortment of wedding attire and wedding rings are available for purchase.
10844 : What will you buy? [Wedding dress/Benedight] set: # gil. %: # gil. Nothing.
10845 : This set includes a benedight coat and a pair of benedight hose. Price: # gil.
10846 : This set includes a bridal corsage, a wedding dress, a pair of wedding hose, and a pair of wedding boots. Price: # gil.
10847 : Confirm purchase? (Current gil: #) Yes. Cancel.

10849 : Hm? Business with the president, ye say?
10850 : Iron Eater! What's the disturbance here?
10851 : Sir Lucius. This adventurer here's brought a curious document.
10852 : Let me see that.
10853 : The two-headed serpent...? This is the seal of the Empire of Aht Urhgan.
10854 : Come with me at once.
10855 : ...That will do.
10856 : How do you read this matter, Lucius?
10857 : This young Empress is either a fool, or she takes us for one. I say she's plotting something.
10858 : One thing is clear. This colossus has the power to bring down an airship as easily as a musketeer would fell a pigeon.
10859 : We may have escaped without casualties once, but there is no guarantee we would be so fortunate a second time.
10860 : Bastok declines the Empire's request. Take your document and be off with you.
10861 : Mister President!
10862 : You sent me to the Empire to observe Nashmeira's coronation. Now hear me when I say that I saw no deception in her eyes.
10863 : I saw one pure of heart. One who, despite her tender years, is possessed of the strength and conviction to unite a nation.
10864 : ...
10865 : A leader beloved and trusted by her people. A leader who now earnestly seeks our aid.
10866 : If we refuse, would we not risk alienating one who might prove to be a steadfast ally?
10867 : ...
10868 : Your words ring true, Volker.
10869 : And yet I cannot agree. As President, I will not take a course of action that would place my citizens in harm's way.
10870 : ...Your Excellency.
10871 : Lucius?
10872 : I can scarce believe what I am saying, but...if Captain Volker is so convinced of the Empire's good faith, perhaps we should reconsider.
10873 : Two of my most trusted advisors now tell me to blindly accept this Empress's words. What say you, %?
10874 : Can Nashmeira be trusted? I swear on my life. On second thought...
10875 : Hmph...and what would a run-of-the-mill adventurer like you know?
10876 : Hmph. I stand in the company of reckless fools...
10877 : Hmph. I stand in the company of reckless fools...
10878 : What are you thinking, %!?
10879 : ...Very well. You have my permission.
10880 : Volker. The moment anything--anything, I say--goes awry, you will take responsibility.
10881 : Mister President, sir!
10882 : My friends. I am pleased to see your safe return.
10883 : Never would I have suspected that Captain Klara was possessed by one of those foul creatures...
10884 : And yet, reflecting back on the past months, it explains much.
10885 : In my ignorance, I thought it merely the travails of war that weighed on her mind. To think that she was waging an even fiercer battle all this time. A battle for her very soul...
10886 : The knowledge that she may lose herself completely, that at any moment she might turn her blade against her beloved comrades... It must have been harrowing, indeed.
10887 : This I know: Klara is fortunate indeed to have friends such as you. Were it not for your efforts, there is little doubt we would have lost her long ago.
10888 : On behalf of the entire republic, you have my gratitude.
10889 : And yet, our battle is far from over.
10890 : The latest report has just come in from the front lines. Thanks to the efforts of the Allied infiltration unit, we've finally secured a direct line of attack against the enemy stronghold.
10891 : The Allied Forces will move against Castle Zvahl with the full brunt of its strength. I will personally lead the Republican Army in support of this offensive.
10892 : I would have you march with me. Under normal circumstances, you'd have earned yourselves a rest for your efforts, but I'm afraid that is a luxury we cannot afford.
10893 : Mister President...does this mean--?
10894 : By presidential decree, the Mythril Musketeers are hereby reinstated in full.
10895 : Zeid. Until such time as Captain Klara is fit to return to duty, I would have you serve as acting captain in her stead.
10896 : Clearly, the bonds you share are as strong--nay, stronger--than the metal from which you take your name. Let these bonds of friendship be your strength, and even the darkest shadow will prove no match for you.
10897 : Yes, sir!
10898 : And you, %...
10899 : You hail from a distant realm, this I know. Despite this, you have made one sacrifice after the next in our Republic's name.
10900 : It would be no exaggeration to say that without your unflagging efforts, Bastok would not stand as strong as it does today.
10901 : As a token of my gratitude, I give you this.
10902 : Furthermore, from this day forward you shall be a full-fledged member of the Mythril Musketeers. The Republic would have your strength for as long as it stands.
10903 : Three cheers for Mythril Musketeer %!
10904 : They tell me our guardsman Gentle Tiger has dubbed you the Sixth Musketeer. I will do him one better: I hereby bestow upon you the designation of Mythril Musketeer Zero.
10905 : A wayfarer from far-off lands you are, and yet serve our nation as loyally as any true Bastoker ever has. Never lose sight of your origins, for it is your unique background that allows you to serve us as no other can.
10906 : Once a Mythril Musketeer, forever a Mythril Musketeer. The Republic is stronger for your presence, %. Promise us that it will always be so.
10907 : Simply incredible... Why, the zero designation is an honor that's been granted to only the most illustrious musketeers in the history of our unit.
10908 : I must confess to feeling a bit of jealousy, %. But just you wait: I fully expect to distinguish myself in the none-too-distant future!
10909 : %. It has been--and always will be--an honor to fight by your side.
10910 : They say that in the days of the Great War, there was a hero of the Republic who distinguished [himself/herself] so highly that [he/she] was bestowed the title of Mythril Musketeer Zero by President Prien himself.
10911 : [His/Her] identity was never made public, and [he/she] remains the only one to this day to receive the honor. What I wouldn't give for the chance to meet such a legend!
10912 : This stupid thing is so damn complicated.
10913 : Come on, Naji! It'll be easy, Naji! <Grumble> Why did I even agree to this?
10914 : Who exactly volunteered me, anyway?
10915 : And now I've got someone bothering me. What is it?
10916 : By Altana! Someone has actually come to me about this Trust thing?
10917 : Taking the buffalo by the horns, are we? I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule.
10918 : Let me be up front with you--I've got absolutely no idea how this works. They told me something about trust and friendship, but what exactly is that supposed to mean?
10919 : But if it works, you'll be able to summon an alter ego of me who'll fight by your side. And let's be honest--who better than me?
10920 : That's what I'm led to believe, anyway. Pretty amazing stuff!
10921 : But I don't know you from a crying street urchin, so it probably won't work. Tough luck, kid.
10922 : And since we've been through some interesting times together, it might be crazy enough to work!
10923 : You were sent on that reconnaissance mission to San d'Oria and Windurst at the behest of President Karst.
10924 : You know I was posted to these gates to keep undesirables out of his hair, but I knew I could count on you, so I let you pass.
10925 : Remember that time Grandma asked you to reforge my father's sword?
10926 : You'd better still have that axe I gave you! Sure got me through some tough times over the years, and I'd sure hate to hear that it's shoved haphazardly in the back of your Mog Locker.
10927 : That whole debacle with the King of Hearts and I in Aht Urhgan sure was a time to remember. You're lucky we managed to pull your ass out of the fire!
10928 : You really gave me what for at that chocobo race, too. It's taken me a while to forgive you!
10929 : But, Naji, that was ages ago! Bah! Next time you won't be so lucky!
10930 : Ah, memories. If I were a weaker man, it might even bring me to tears.
10931 : But this whole Trust magic ordeal...memories alone don't make strong bonds! You're going to need a bit more than that!
10932 : Iron Eater always called me dumb as a tree stump and simple as a wooden spear, but I'll have you know I am both complex and intricate!
10933 : So don't blame me if this fails. It's all on your head.
10934 : Now, concentrate, my compatriot! Focus on your feelings of trust and friendship!
10935 : If you won't believe in me, then believe in the fact that I believe in you! Wait, what did I just say?
10936 : This is all that it took? That idiot Clarion Star gave such a long explanation of sorts that I was ready to stand here for hours and hours!
10937 : But I'll be damned if this doesn't feel good. Let's try it out!
10938 : Hey, you little--get back here!!!
10939 : Phew! That could have ended very badly. At least I can control the thing.
10940 : Ha! Now I can guard two doors at the same time! Wait...why am I getting excited about that?
10941 : I am the quintessential warrior, number five in the Mythril Musketeer hierarchy, and if I ever catch you referring to me as a doorman, I'll bite your head off!
10942 : Ugggh...this doorman thing hits a little too close to home.
10943 : I'm pumped and ready to go! Now, to catch Ayame and tell her how I really feel!
10944 : Gah! I'm fine with this thing inheriting my many talents, but some things are better kept under wraps!
10945 : Now, to keep it from getting me into trouble!
10946 : Congratulations on your tremendous success! And before I forget, I've got to give this to you. You earned it, pal!
10947 : You can use it to summon an alter ego of the strongest Mythril Musketeer--me--at any time.
10948 : Give it a shake outside of town. Maybe North or South Gustaberg, for instance. I'm sure you'll be more than pleased with the result.
10949 : And far be it from me to confess my weakness...but I'm a bit curious as to whether it will actually work. Come back to me once you've tried it out.
10950 : Tell me every last detail! Did my alter ego do the real me justice?
10951 : How did it go? Couldn't be happier. Well...I'm not too impressed.
10952 : Can't say that I'm surprised. When you're working with a man like me, of course you'll get great results. Now you know why Iron Eater chose who he did!
10953 : Not impressed? Stop blathering on like a baby!
10954 : How couldn't you be impressed by someone so complex and intricate?
10955 : Be that as it may, if you need to learn more about Trust, just go back and ask Clarion Star. He seems to know a lot about this stuff.
10956 : He kept muttering something about latent potential and ongoing research or what-have-you. I wasn't really paying attention.
10957 : But what I did find interesting was that there are also people in other nations with their gaze trained on this program.
10958 : If the whole process confounds me, then it's no surprise that there are people out there trying to figure out just how it works.
10959 : But you don't need to cross the border to find out more. Some other people here in Bastok are participating, like...Ayame.
10960 : She's number four here in the Mythril Musketeers, and I doubt she'd let just any old adventurer try out Trust magic with her.
10961 : Y-you want me to ask her for you? No, no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
10962 : She knows you pretty well by now. Just give her a quick kick for me when you go see her, hmm?
10963 : There's something else I must give you: this %. Well, there's nothing more you need from me here.
10964 : You've got what you came for. Just make sure to treat my alter ego well, or I'll have to hunt you down--and you won't be happy when I find you!
10965 : It is a pleasure to... Oh? You have %?
10966 : I am assisting the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies in gathering data on this new Trust magic.
10967 : One of my duties as a ranking member of the Mythril Musketeers is to ensure that we are ready for any eventuality--and it is my firm belief that this new discovery may serve us well.
10968 : It is my fervent hope that it will aid us in our struggles against the Beastman Confederate. If not, perhaps it can at least be used to assist with some of our more menial tasks.
10969 : If possible, I would like to enlist your aid in this endeavor.
10970 : But unfortunately, it seems this magic would require a bond between us, a bond we do not yet share.
10971 : There are other things you must take care of first. I wish you the best in your efforts to protect [Bastok/your homeland].
10972 : The very fact that you have chosen to visit me this day can only mean one thing. You wish to see whether you can call forth my alter ego.
10973 : Attempt the ritual with Ayame? Let's give this a shot. Not at the moment.
10974 : I would urge you to reconsider. This city requires more strength and resolve; the last thing it needs is more Najis.
10975 : Remember that this magic draws on the power of deeply personal bonds. Bonds which can both steady the heart and set it to racing.
10976 : Let us think back once more to all that has transpired between us.
10977 : You rescued me from the terrifying clutches of a dragon in Waughroon Shrine.
10978 : My alter ego is but a reflection of myself. Should you succeed in calling out to her, she will surely remember your deeds.
10979 : [You aided me when Volker chose to give up his position as the head of our troupe./You also aided me when Volker chose to give up his position as the head of our troupe.]
10980 : The only reason the Musketeers were able to reclaim their former glory was due to your valiant efforts during the battle between Zeid and our leader.
10981 : [I remember now./And there's more.] You [/also ]helped me during that incident with Viresefilant when I made one of my journeys to Norg.
10982 : Our efforts in that case bore certain fruit. We were able to confirm the details of an agreement vital to Bastokan interests.
10983 : Would only that the dark underbelly of Bastok had not been exposed to you in the process... One day I hope to bring it to its rightful conclusion.
10984 : Oh, [/and ]I would be loath to forget my younger sister, Kaede. My father mentioned that it was your help that guided my sister down her path.
10985 : Sometimes I talk with her about my mother...and somehow, your name always comes up.
10986 : [You know,/And what's more,] Naji told me of your momentous exploits over in Aht Urhgan.
10987 : I'm quite sure his role was less significant than he made it out to be, and we truly have you to thank for how things turned out.
10988 : My heart skipped a beat when I heard that the airship came tumbling down like a boulder rolled off a cliff.
10989 : Who could forget when you vanquished Huu Xalmo the Savage, displaying your true prowess as one of the finest monks in the land?
10990 : You have taken the path my predecessor Cornelia took and made it your own. As a member of the Mythril Musketeers, I understand like no other what that decision means.
10991 : How could I forget that you beat Infinity XIII!?
10992 : You remember--during the chocobo races. To think that I lost after all the effort I put into my chocobo's care. But it was a battle well-fought, and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.
10993 : [The/Further, the] flashing dance of blades in Delkfutt's Tower taught me more about swordsmanship than I ever thought possible. One dream of mine is that we may sometime spar again as we did that day.
10994 : Who else could have felled so many in such a short period of time? There was a spark in your eyes and a spring in your step that few can hope to replicate.
10995 : [So let me ask,/Since you are here,] what called you to participate in this grand experiment?
10996 : You need not respond. I spoke for your benefit, not my own.
10997 : Remember those feelings. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Think.
10998 : I had faith in you, %, and you truly shone brightly.
10999 : A fitting conclusion, given all we have been through. Now you know what it is like to have a true bond with someone.
11000 : I see, adventurer. You have % in your possession.
11001 : As you are surely aware, the Mythril Musketeers have elected to participate in the Trust initiative on behalf of the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies.
11002 : Would that we could do more, but we are currently engaged with matters relevant to Bastok's national security. I would ask you to aid [us/your home nation] in the struggle against the Beastman Confederate first.
11003 : You've come at the perfect time.
11004 : I, Volker, serve the Mythril Musketeers as its captain.
11005 : I hereby permit you to engage in the Trust ritual with me.
11006 : But first, a word of warning. Ayame and Naji always complain that I am prone to giving boring lectures. My alter ego, naturally, would be cut from the same cloth. Are you still sure you wish to engage in this bonding nevertheless?
11007 : Attempt the ritual? Yes. No.
11008 : Everyone calls me a big complainer, but I wouldn't be this way if it wasn't for a certain Number Five...
11009 : You will? That alone proves you feel a strong bond between us.
11010 : Well, at the very least, I feel a strong bond with you. How could I not, after you vanquished the Shadow Lord in Castle Zvahl?
11011 : And, of course, you also heard what went on between Werei and me.
11012 : I can still feel him watching over me to this day.
11013 : Yes, even though he felt that ascending to the rank of captain was Zeid's right.
11014 : What's more, afterward you found what lay deep within the recesses of despair and hatred. I found myself with nothing but the utmost respect for you.
11015 : There was also the time when I confronted Zeid...no, my own past in Xarcabard.
11016 : It was thanks to you that I was able to clear my mind of all doubts.
11017 : Whenever I look back on what transpired there, I cannot help but see your face.
11018 : Another reason why I have so much trust in you is your long list of exploits in Aht Urhgan.
11019 : You took good care of Naji--although if you ask him, it was he who looked after you.
11020 : I'd also like to thank you for everything you taught me in the Stellar Fulcrum.
11021 : People are always telling me that I'm forgettable...but I think I proved them wrong that day.
11022 : So from now on, I demand to be referred to as somber.
11023 : But I suppose you didn't come here to be talked at for hours on end.
11024 : I've said my piece. It's time for us to commence the ritual.
11025 : Close your eyes and concentrate.
11026 : Yes! I had faith in you, %, but this is wonderful!
11027 : Take pride in your accomplishment today, and go forth. Not just for the sake of my alter ego, but for Bastok--and all Vana'diel.
11028 : You can set this as your current home point. Once you set a home point, you will return there whenever you are incapacitated.
11029 : Set this as current home point? Yes. No.
11030 : Home point set!
11031 : A home point can be set as a spot for you to return to Vana'diel when you have been knocked out. You can also use a home point to teleport to other home points.
11032 : What will you do? Travel to another home point. Set this as your home point. Other settings. On second thought, never mind.
11033 : You have registered a new home point! You are now able to teleport here from any other home point.
11034 : You may teleport from here to any other home point you have registered.

11045 : You are now selecting by [region/expansion].
11046 : Teleport where? None of these. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. [Add to favorites/Remove from favorites].
11047 : Home Point ## in % has been [registered to/removed from] your list of favorite locations.
11048 : Your list of favorite locations is full. You must delete an existing entry in order to register a new one.
11049 : Delete which? None of these. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##. % ##.
11050 : A document about this new Trust Initiative... What would the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies want with me?
11051 : On the surface, it does not seem particularly dangerous...
11052 : Oh ho. You have brought along %. This can only mean one thing--you wish to try the ritual with me.
11053 : Naji and Ayame have been blustering all about it for weeks. It's fun. You should try it!
11054 : Volker, for his part, has remained largely silent...but his gaze weighs heavy on my shoulders.
11055 : I cannot help but think--is there a need for every Mythril Musketeer, down to a man, to participate?
11056 : And what if it proves more sinister than it seems at first glance? It could bring down our entire group!
11057 : Therefore, as the second in command, I felt it was my duty to refrain.
11058 : But now, with the others on my case, it is time for me to search for an appropriate partner.
11059 : ... You suggest that I try it with one of those three!?
11060 : Have you not heard a single word I have said? I am completely fed up with them!
11061 : It would be a hundredfold less painful if it were with someone like you!
11062 : So, shall we try this?
11063 : Attempt the ritual? Yes. No.
11064 : I should not be surprised that you have other matters to tend to. I shall look for someone else.
11065 : Excellent. Now, how should we proceed?
11066 : Obviously, there must be a bit of trust involved. I suppose friendship would not hurt, either.
11067 : <Mutter> Hmm, hmm... <Grumble>...trust...
11068 : Well, I certainly do trust you, after you led the incident with Volker and Zeid to a satisfactory conclusion.
11069 : You brought together the Mythril Musketeers so that we could continue to protect Bastok and ensure the prosperity of her citizens.
11070 : When I think about friendship, I am reminded of my master, Werei.
11071 : You were instrumental in my mastery over the way of the axe. To find your calling, you must first think long and hard.
11072 : And you shined a beaming ray of hope on those Galka grieving over the loss of their homeland.
11073 : The bonds of brotherhood are a thing to treasure--and for those Galka grieving over the loss of their homeland--to reclaim.
11074 : It was thanks to your efforts that we found the piece of wood Werei left behind[, wasn't it?/.]
11075 : That simple fragment, together with the wise words of Gumbah, changed the very future of the Galka race.
11076 : My calling now is to ensure that Galka of all stripes learn to celebrate their pasts, treasure those around them, and love Bastok as if it were their own.
11077 : When I ruminate upon friendship, one episode in particular comes to mind: when you helped me renew my ties with Raogrimm and Deidogg.
11078 : [Ah, friendship. When/Further, when] I was a child, I may have chosen to become an adventurer myself should I have met one as passionate as you.
11079 : Of course, it was my deep admiration for Raogrimm that ended up leading me to the Mythril Musketeers.
11080 : [Friendship...? Oh, yes, I remember when, back/There were times, too, when back] in Aht Urhgan, Zazarg inquired about the relationship the two of us shared.
11081 : Yes, that does take me back! Someone who could come to his aid is certainly worthy of being called a friend.
11082 : You can surely come up with % yourself, so there is no need for me to give you one, right? Hahaha!
11083 : With that out of the way, I suppose the time is nigh!
11084 : Allow me to lend you my services so that we may shelter the meek from the ills of this world.
11085 : That is my wish as well, %. I know Vana'diel is safe in your capable hands.
11086 : What is this? A matter of import unrelated to the previous incidents you were involved in?
11087 : Ah, you seek Lion. Of course I know her.
11088 : The one who strong-armed her way in here seeking an audience, right?
11089 : That's right. I remember Lucius speaking with her a great deal.
11090 : Quadavs this, Quadavs that...'tis a wonder I did not pass out from the tiresome repetition.
11091 : It simply would not do for me to trouble the president with this matter, so I answered her to the best of my ability.
11092 : And what's your connection with her?
11093 : Ah, and you expect she could provide you the answer. Unfortunately, you will not find her here.
11094 : My understanding is that she departed some time ago, bound for either Windurst or San d'Oria.
11095 : Perhaps you will come across her in the course of your activities.
11096 : Me? You were looking for me?
11097 : You say my father told you to seek me out?
11098 : I've been trying to figure out as much as I can about the strange portals that link our Vana'diel to another dimension.
11099 : But we've got other problems to deal with first. Let's worry about it once we've finished our current mission.
11100 : I'll meet you at the Crag of Dem in Konschtat Highlands once we've got that burden off our shoulders. Or we could catch up at Holla or Mea, if that's preferable to you.
11101 : Remember to see the missions posed to you by your home nation to completion first, though.
11102 : Here we sell items from the various guildmasters and also exchange crafter points for your convenience.
11103 : Sorry, we don't allow amateur craftsmen to take advantage of our services.
11104 : What would you like to do? Purchase a crafting kit. Exchange crafter points. . Special materials. Check the deliverable items. Ask about the delivery process. Never mind.
11105 : Please select a product. % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). % (Quantity: #). Maybe some other time.
11106 : How many? (Current gil: #) 1 (# gil). 2 (# gil). 3 (# gil). 4 (# gil). 5 (# gil). 6 (# gil). 7 (# gil). 8 (# gil). 9 (# gil). 10 (# gil). 11 (# gil). 12 (# gil). I changed my mind.
11107 : You want to purchase %? It will cost # gil for # of them.
11108 : Are you sure about this? Yes, I'm sure. On second thought...
11109 : I'm sorry, we don't currently seem to have the item available in that quantity.
11110 : Which item? (# crafter points) % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). I changed my mind.
11111 : Do you want to purchase the % for # crafter points?
11112 : Do you want to make the trade? Yes. No.
11113 : You don't have enough crafter points.
11114 : These are the items that we are taking deliveries of. Simply select an item whenever you want to check the recipe.
11115 : Deliverable Items %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm finished here.
11116 : This is where you can deliver the crafting sets that the guildmasters have created.
11117 : By delivering items, you can earn crafter points that can be exchanged for special ingredients.
11118 : Crafting sets can be made by using special crystals known as analysis crystals, crystals which that enable you to set the quality level.
11119 : The higher the quality level of the crafting set created, the more crafter points you'll earn, so try to make the highest quality sets you can manage.
11120 : Analysis crystals can be obtained from the person in charge of accepting deliveries in exchange for guild points.
11121 : Analysis crystals cannot be used to create items other than the ones in the crafting sets.
11122 : Please note that you can't use % in place of %.
11123 : The ingredients required to make a crafting set can be checked by referring to the deliverable items list.
11124 : At the present time, you can receive up to a maximum of # guild point[/s].
11125 : Any points beyond that from making deliveries will be lost, so keep that in mind.
11126 : Crafting sets delivered here will be sold as crafting kits until the next day at 10:00 a.m. (Vana'diel time).
11127 : It helps the junior members of the guild, so keep on making those deliveries.
11128 : Thanks for the delivery. Everything looks to be in order.
11129 : You receive # crafter point[/s], and now have a total of # crafter point[/s]!
11130 : We now have available % for the low cost of # gil per.
11131 : I am willing to part with up to #.
11132 : My apologies, but our stock is limited and I cannot sell you any more at this time.
11133 : What do you want to do? Obtain a kit. Check the scheduled quantity. Ship the item. Nothing.
11134 : Which do you want? %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Exit.
11135 : What is the quality? (1-1000)
11136 : %: #
11137 : Hey there. Hm? What's that shield you're holding?
11138 : Oh... I see you've met her already.
11139 : Yeah, I heard the story about an amazing shield that boosts one's crafting ability just by equipping it. I never thought such a thing could be possible.
11140 : I'd be curious to see if it actually works or not.
11141 : I know you're quite skilled, and if she picked you, I guess it means you've got what it takes to make the shield.
11142 : Alright then. Let's get you the recipe. Make sure you don't forget it, you hear?
11143 : Okay, you'll need some ingredients to get started. First on the list is %.
11144 : It's necessary to boost the Craftsmanship of the % to its max value.
11145 : I've actually got some notes on Craftsmanship here. I'll go over 'em quickly with you before we continue.
11146 : You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the % equipped.
11147 : Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you have trouble.
11148 : In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.
11149 : You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...
11150 : That's all it says.
11151 : Come and see me when you get the Craftsmanship up. I'll get that % for you.
11152 : Next, you'll need % and %. I've given them to Esvin.
11153 : You've made deliveries before, right? That's what you'll need to do to get the ingredients.
11154 : You can talk to Esvin for more details.
11155 : That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after you've upgraded it. I want to see what all the fuss is about.
11156 : Huh? You forgot the recipe? Fine. Here's the list of ingredients again. Try to remember it this time.
11157 : Well, I guess I've never had any complaints with you. You know what you're doing, so I'm certain you can pull it off.
11158 : Wow, this is quite impressive. I ought to be able to craft the % now.
11159 : Okay, here's the %.
11160 : I poured my craftsman's spirit into the shield and it made this crystal. I've got no idea how it all works, but it's pretty amazing, no?
11161 : Although, by creating the %, it seems the Craftsmanship of the % has decreased.
11162 : I guess it's not a problem to upgrade the %, but you'll need to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to craft % again.
11163 : Of course, I know you'd never do anything as stupid as to lose this. Hahaha.
11164 : Hey! Are you trying to tell me you lost the %?!
11165 : I guess it can't be helped. Here, I'll make another %. Let me see your shield.
11166 : You're one of my greatest rivals in this business. You should know to take proper care of your ingredients.
11167 : I see you've made the upgrade. Let me see what you've got there.
11168 : Hmm... It looks different, and it's even giving off a faint energy. It still doesn't seem to be complete though.
11169 : I guess you're gonna have to craft with it multiple times to get the best results. She probably already told you that though.
11170 : Oh yeah. You needed some kind of proof that the shield was made. Wait just a moment.
11171 : That oughta do it.
11172 : Just show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'll be set.
11173 : By the way, I've always got deliveries to be made to Esvin. I hope you'll help me bring up the guild's newer members.
11174 : Oh! You brought the shield with you. You must be here to upgrade it.
11175 : I got the recipe, so let's take a look at it.
11176 : That's it.
11177 : Now for the ingredients... First, you'll need to start with %.
11178 : You equipped the aspis when you made the ecu, right? This is basically the same thing. You'll need to craft items while equipping the %.
11179 : That'll increase its Craftsmanship for ya. Just keep at it until it reaches 100%.
11180 : Come back when you're done and I'll prepare the % for ya.
11181 : After that, you'll need % and %. I've given both of them to Esvin.
11182 : Last up is the %. For this one, I've enlisted the help of the A.M.A.N. There're a number of Records of Eminence objectives for you to complete.
11183 : Check the Records of Eminence for more details. If you see the objectives through to the end, you'll get the %.
11184 : That's it for the ingredients. It might be a bit tough, but I know you're up to the challenge.
11185 : Ahh, it looks like you've brought the shield's Craftsmanship up.
11186 : Okay, let's get you that %.
11187 : Here you go!
11188 : Oh, it looks like making the % caused the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.
11189 : It takes a lot of work to get the shield's Craftsmanship up. So don't go do something stupid like losing this thing.
11190 : This shield is really amazing. I wish I could carry it in my shop. Whaddya say? Interested in selling it to me?
11191 : Hahaha! Just kidding. Seriously though, this shield possesses immense power. I look forward to seeing just how powerful it can become.
11192 : Now, let's get you that proof that the shield is finished.
11193 : I really hate to see this thing go... Take it over to Mewk Chorosap before I change my mind.
11194 : I don't believe this... Fine, get out there and that final objective again!
11195 : Ahh, it's good to see ya! Let's hurry up and get you that recipe.
11196 : Hm? You already know the recipe? Oh, sorry about that. Is there something else you want to check?
11197 : You want to know how to get the % and %? I've got them, but I'm not gonna just give 'em to ya for free.
11198 : The Blacksmiths' Guild has received a number of orders for various products. I could use your help making the items and then delivering them to the customer.
11199 : But keep in mind that the customer is demanding the items be made nearby. I guess it's in order to keep an eye on the quality of the finished goods.
11200 : In other words, you can only deliver that which they've seen you craft. Although, products used for repairs can be taken directly to them.
11201 : You'll need to gather the materials needed to make the item yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, but there is at least a bit of good news for ya.
11202 : It's still in the trial phase, but the guilds have agreed on a system to sell certain items that were previously unavailable. It might make it easier for you to get certain materials.
11203 : Speak to the vendor in charge of crafting sets within each guild to see the available items. Of course, you'll need to pay for them first.
11204 : But, note that you might not always be able to buy what you need. Each guild has its own set of rules.
11205 : Once you've finished all of the requests, I'll give you the % and %.
11206 : Okay, this is the [first/next/final] request.
11207 : Deliver # % to Crooked Arrow in %. He's in front of the Auction House.
11208 : Deliver # % to Crooked Arrow in %. He's in front of the Auction House.
11209 : Deliver # % to Naji the Mythril Musketeer in %
11210 : Deliver # % to Raibaht. You can find him on the second floor of Cid's Lab in %
11211 : You can take this item directly to the customer.
11212 : Come report back to me once you're finished with the request.
11213 : Your current request is as follows...
11214 : So, how's the request going?
11215 : Everything okay? Everything's great! It could be better...
11216 : Gwahaha! I don't know what I was fretting about. Keep up the good work.
11217 : Hm? Are my ears deceiving me? You really want to give up on this request?
11218 : Will you see this through? I'll do my best. I've had enough.
11219 : What's the matter? You're normally more reliable than anyone. Are you not feeling well? I guess I'll have to ask another craftsman to look after the customer.
11220 : Maybe you should take a break for a while. You can take on another request once you've recovered.
11221 : So, are you ready to get back at it? I've got the next request for you right here.
11222 : Ah, it looks like you've completed the deliveries to the customer. Thanks for the help.
11223 : It's good to see you. Looks like you've finished up the last delivery. I knew I could count on you.
11224 : Okay, here are the % and % as promised.
11225 : If you happen to lose them for some reason, you can always replace them by using guild points.
11226 : I've gotten pretty good at this, don't you think?
11227 : So this is the new shield... Let me see it.
11228 : Hahaha! It truly is a thing of beauty. It's surprisingly light for how big it is. I wonder if it could be used in battle.
11229 : She thinks that the next upgrade will bring out the great power within the shield. At last, you've almost reached your destination!
11230 : Oh, wait a moment. I've got a new crafting technique for you. You're skilled enough to be able to craft quality equipment with it. Give it a try if you're interested.
11231 : Hey, it's good to see you again.
11232 : Let's get down to it then. Here's how you go about getting the necessary materials.
11233 : You'll need both % and %.
11234 : Like usual, you can get them by exchanging crafter points for them. Once you have enough, go see Esvin to make the trade.
11235 : That just leaves the %. It's also just like you remember. Boost your shield's Craftsmanship to 100% and bring it to me.
11236 : That about covers it. Hang in there! You've almost reached the end of the journey!
11237 : I was asked to give this to Mewk Chorosap. I suppose you already know that though. Here, get going already.
11238 : Hey there. What do you need?
11239 : Ah, you must be talking about that item the Tarutaru girl from Adoulin ordered. I really put my heart and soul into that thing.
11240 : Actually, I already sent it off to Jeuno as per her request.
11241 : I imagine it must've been delivered to Mewk Chorosap by now.
11242 : Ah, it's you again; perfect timing! Take a look at this. Somehow, the % you came to get was just hanging here on the wall of the guild.
11243 : This is what you need, right? Take it, it's yours.
11244 : Wow! This is really something!
11245 : I can immediately tell by looking at the emblem. This must be the finished shield.
11246 : It really is amazing! Simply equipping it will make you into a walking endorsement for the guild! Hahaha!
11247 : Oh, that reminds me... Here, I have something for you. It's a new crafting technique.
11248 : You've completed a difficult trial, but you still have far to go on your journey. If you do not keep at it, your skills will erode over time. I hope you will use this to continue honing your craft!
11249 : 0: # 1: # 2: # 3: #
11250 : You have entered the crafting target area.
11251 : Crafting the requested items in the current target area will count towards the number of items you are required to deliver them.
11252 : You have left the crafting target area.
11253 : # % remaining.
11254 : I've requested the delivery of some %. I require a total of # more.
11255 : Oh, it's just the % I was looking for. Now I just need # more.
11256 : Oh, these are just the % I was looking for. Now I just need # more.
11257 : Okay, that's all of them. Thanks for the help. Hope to work with you again some time!
11258 : I need some %. Think you can bring me # more?
11259 : Yes, this is the % I'm looking for. Thanks. I think # more oughta do it.
11260 : Yes, these are the % I'm looking for. Thanks. I think # more oughta do it.
11261 : This is all of the % I require. Thanks again.
11262 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
11263 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
11264 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
11265 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
11266 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).
11267 : Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.
11268 : The % nods in agreement.
11269 : new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
11270 : new Records of Eminence objective, %, is now available!
11271 : You wish to exchange your sparks?
11272 : Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
11273 : Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
11274 : Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
11275 : Thanks to your donation, I now have # % in safekeeping.
11276 : Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
11277 : Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
11278 : Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
11279 : Why? What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
11280 : Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of # % from you.
11281 : You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
11282 : Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
11283 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
11284 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
11285 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
11286 : Grrreat! Now I have # % from you. Thanks!
11287 : Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
11288 : I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
11289 : Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
11290 : I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
11291 : Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of # % for you.
11292 : Records of Eminence is a system brought to you by the caring folks at the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Set your own objectives whenever you desire, and fulfill them to receive compensation.
11293 : To set these tasks, select 'Objective List' from the Quests menu, then choose ones that suit your fancy.
11294 : You will be rewarded with gil and sparks of eminence, which serve the same function as points, notes, credits, and other such methods of quantifying one's greatness. As an extra incentive, adventurers will earn three times the amount of sparks for completing an objective the first time.
11295 : Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
11296 : As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
11297 : Lastly, any and all acts of vandalism directed against your % are strictly prohibited.
11298 : Should you be found in violation of this dictum, the heavens will part and wrath incarnate will descend to mete out justice upon you.
11299 : The maximum number of % that may be stored is #.
11300 : You do not possess enough % to complete the transaction.
11301 : You do not possess enough sparks of eminence to complete the transaction.
11302 : You have reached the maximum number of sparks that you can exchange this week (#). Your ability to purchase skill books and equipment will be restricted until next week.
11303 : You may use up to # more sparks of eminence to purchase items.

11372 : And now I've got to track down a Goblin...ugh.
11373 : Hang on... Maybe that's the key. Maybe I should have gone dressed in all black. <Grumble, grumble>
11374 : Ugh...those three fiends are sneakier than they look. I lost sight of them for one second and completely lost the trail.
11375 : I did see an eggshell lying on the ground, though, and figured it may have been the one Raebrimm gave them...
11376 : But it was just an ordinary eggshell.
11377 : Great. What am I supposed to tell Iron Eater?
11378 : You needn't worry. I tended to the wounds of those injured in the mines.
11379 : As a musketeer, I'm well-trained in the art of healing. Plus, I've had more than my fair share of injuries over the years, which has given me plenty of practice in the field.
11380 : I heard from Lady Cornelia and the people who saw the Quadav. It seems the Quadav were searching for something.
11381 : At any rate, I'm glad no real harm came to the Zeruhn Mines or the people working them.
11382 : Ah, it's you. Do you have business in the President's Office?
11383 : Yes, as a matter of fact, [he/she] does.
11384 : [He/She] is here about the Quadav attack on the Zeruhn Mines led by Do'Bho Venomtail.
11385 : Surely you know of my father's decision, Iron Eater...
11386 : You should ask him yourself, my lady.
11387 : I already tried. He just got angry and told me to go to my room.
11388 : Do you know something, %? Were you summoned to the meeting?
11389 : But you were the one who defeated Do'Bho Venomtail! It's not fair to leave you out of this!
11390 : Yes, I also believe that % has a right to know the truth.
11391 : Iron Eater, would you mind explaining it to [him/her]?
11392 : First of all, our investigation at the Zeruhn Mines went exactly as we expected. The Quadav forces came down the river from the Palborough Mines.
11393 : Witnesses at the scene say that the Quadav were chasing something.
11394 : Meanwhile, three beastmen led by a Goblin clad in black were seen racing toward the Bastok Mines.
11395 : What!? A black-clad Goblin? Surely, it must've been...
11396 : Who was it? The Gloom Phantom. The Destiny Destroyers. Zeid.
11397 : Yes, that's the one! You're absolutely right!
11398 : Yes, that's them! The group consisting of the Gloom Phantom and his friends!
11399 : Huh!? Sure, he wears black, but I don't think it was him.
11400 : No, I'm talking about the Gloom Phantom.
11401 : Yes, we were thinking the same thing, so we talked to Raebrimm, who was previously a target of theirs.
11402 : However, we did not really learn anything new. It appears that Raebrimm is not involved.
11403 : Yes, that makes sense... The Destiny Destroyers were satisfied once they got that eggshell, right?
11404 : Although, their real objective was the egg, and we're still not sure about the reason why.
11405 : Did you find out anything, %?
11406 : What will you talk about? The Yagudo and Orc conspiracy. The Destiny Destroyers. The World Eater Egg.
11407 : What's that you say? The Yagudo were searching for the egg in Windurst!?
11408 : And an Orcish unit was dispatched to San d'Oria...
11409 : So these beastmen are all trying to steal the egg for themselves. That means the Quadav probably are as well...
11410 : You're talking about that trio that showed up where the egg was?
11411 : And they worked together alongside the Orcs in the Northlands to break open the egg.
11412 : So, if they've shown up here, then that means... Wait, could the egg be somewhere near Bastok?
11413 : If so, then that might mean they're here to break open this egg for themselves.
11414 : Some legendary egg that gives untold power if broken open? I find it all rather hard to believe.
11415 : Fortunately, if what you say is true, then that power is not so easily obtained.
11416 : That Orc was destroyed when he broke open the egg. I suppose the power was too much for him to bear.
11417 : What if someone capable of wielding that power were to appear? The mere thought of such a thing terrifies me.
11418 : We must inform Sir Lucius about this matter immediately.
11419 : I must tell my father about this World Eater Egg right away. The Quadav can wait.
11420 : No, my lady. Like the other beastmen, the Quadav are also hoping to harness the egg's power.
11421 : In fact, they may have already obtained that power.
11422 : So you mean they purposely showed up at the Zeruhn Mines in order to provoke us? That they are hoping to start a war?
11423 : First, they lead the Republican military to the Palborough Mines, where they can use the egg's overwhelming power...
11424 : Wait just a moment, Sir Volker, Iron Eater...
11425 : Do you mean to say that my father intends to start a war?
11426 : Um...
11427 : I know that the Quadav are our sworn enemy. However, we must remain calm if we are to avoid needless bloodshed.
11428 : Naturally, there are many who share your opinion, my lady. Whether they can sway the opinion of the Senate, however...
11429 : We have to at least try! Once we set down the path to war, there's no turning back!
11430 : They say victory favors those who move first.
11431 : I realize I may be a young girl who knows little of the ways of the world...
11432 : However, that is also why I can say what needs to be said. There are things that people must know if we are to go to war.
11433 : What if you were to enlist %'s services, my lady?
11434 : Yes, that is an excellent idea.
11435 : Please, %! Can you go investigate the Palborough Mines for us?
11436 : We need to know if the Quadav have acquired the World Eater Egg or the power it holds within. And if not, we need to know what their plans are.
11437 : You must help us decide whether Bastok needs to engage the Quadav in all-out war.
11438 : Will you agree to the request? Yes, I'll do it. Sorry, I can't help you.
11439 : You have the gratitude of our entire nation. I shall go and speak to my father.
11440 : Additionally, I shall speak to everyone involved with this incident to see if we are missing anything.
11441 : Until we meet again!
11442 : You must help us! This matter concerns you too! We can't let ourselves go blindly into war!
11443 : If the Senate decides to go to war, there is little that can be done. However, I do wish to avoid any unnecessary harm to the republic.
11444 : I wish you luck, %.
11445 : Head to the Palborough Mines and find out whether the Quadav have obtained the World Eater Egg or not. We also need you to find out what they're up to.
11446 : Please carry out our lady's request as quickly as you are able. There might not be much time remaining.
11447 : Ah, you're back at last. The good lady has eagerly awaited your return.
11448 : I most definitely have!
11449 : You must tell us about the Quadav at once! Before it's too late!
11450 : I knew it! The Quadav that appeared at the Zeruhn Mines weren't part of some assassination squad!
11451 : So just as we thought, they were chasing after the Destiny Destroyers, yes?
11452 : When they broke open the World Eater Egg, the Quadav's eggs were consumed...
11453 : It's only natural that they'd be out for blood.
11454 : Can we really be sure that the Quadav weren't after the power contained within the World Eater Egg for themselves?
11455 : I think so. Besides, if they were truly planning to use its power, I think they would've used the scorpion to their advantage too.
11456 : But the Quadav were also trying to kill the scorpion.
11457 : That makes sense. I think we might just be able to convince the president...
11458 : That's excellent news! Now we can forget about this stupid war with the Quadav!
11459 : However, that mage who absorbed the power from the mind-warped scorpion is sure to be a problem.
11460 : Hm!? You're talking about the Tarutaru mage Uran-Mafran! Is he a mage from the Federation of Windurst?
11461 : If so, then Bastok's enemy is not the Quadav, but possibly the Federation of Windurst instead.
11462 : It's okay... That's still just conjecture.
11463 : Like we did with the Quadav, we just need to find out the truth of the matter.
11464 : You're right. Now then, we need to find out more about this mage known as Uran-Mafran.
11465 : I'll get Captain Volker up to speed on everything that's happened. After that, I want you and him to speak with the president...
11466 : Understood!
11467 : Although, before I go to speak with Volker...
11468 : Please, take this present from me. I always cook whenever I'm worried about something...
11469 : Also, there's something I must tell you.
11470 : You have my utmost gratitude, %.
11471 : Thanks to your help, I was able to achieve the outcome I believed to be just.
11472 : Hey, do you remember what I told you before?
11473 : There is a lot more of this country that I want to learn about. And maybe someday I can become somebody who will represent the people and bring change to Bastok.
11474 : I have grown since then. Now, it isn't just this country that I wish to know more about, but the world itself.
11475 : And once I do, I want to help the people of this country even more. I think I can help my father as well.
11476 : I feel as if all this has enabled me to take a first step on that path. That is my duty as the President's daughter...
11477 : At any rate, I first need to convince my father of the cause. Don't worry though, I've got it handled.
11478 : Furthermore, I think I understand what my father means when he says the following...
11479 : I won't let anyone stand in my way. He doesn't like people who don't back up their words with action.
11480 : Therefore, I need to show him, not just tell him. That is my duty as my father's daughter.
11481 : One day, I'll make him see it for himself... He'll see that trusting his daughter is the right thing to do.
11482 : At any rate, I first need to convince my father of the cause. Don't worry though, I've got it handled.
11483 : Lady Cornelia left this with me. Here, it's yours.
11484 : I asked Ayame to look into the mage known as Uran-Mafran. She has connections in Norg, so she's perfect for the task.
11485 : As for the president, that's up to the good captain and Lady Cornelia... I think it should turn out okay.
11486 : Although, there are still many unanswered questions about this World Eater Egg. I'm not sure how the Mithril Musketeers should respond.
11487 : Thanks to you, we have received valuable information from the Palborough Mines.
11488 : I have asked plenty of questions, but there is still much I do not understand. In times like these, it is important to proceed with caution.
11489 : Hey, did you hear the news? Ayame has been given an important mission from Sir Iron Eater.
11490 : Yet I get stuck here tending to the wounded. I know it's important work too, but...
