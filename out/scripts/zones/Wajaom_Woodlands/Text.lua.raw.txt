6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7325 : The salt grains patter against the stone tablet and scatter all over the ground. You could have sworn hearing the tinkling sound of a bell...
7326 : You see an engraved stone tablet. A slight warmth is radiating from its surface.
7327 : Place your hand on the tablet? Yes. No.
7328 : Choose a picture to take.
7329 : First scene.
7330 : Second scene.
7331 : Third scene.
7332 : Which picture will you take? Show me again. First scene. Second scene. Third scene.
7333 : % records the first scene.
7334 : % records the second scene.
7335 : % records the third scene.
7336 : % takes in the surrounding scenery. ...The view is breathtaking.
7337 : % thinks back on Balakaf's words. ...Perhaps this is not the best time to record a picture.
7338 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7339 : You see something shiny on the ground...
7340 : A chill runs down your spine!
7341 : There is an oddly shaped sprout here. A liquid drips from the plant when you touch it, making your eyes blink rapidly.
7342 : There is an oddly shaped sprout here. Some sort of liquid drips onto your hand when you touch it
7343 : You hear voices raised in argument...
7344 : What do you mean? You have to explain why.
7345 : No more, can we meet. That is all. No reason, there is.
7346 : But we were going to stop the fighting together! Was that all just a lie!?
7347 : ...
7348 : !!!
7349 : (My brothers are here. You go now. Safe, it is not.)
7350 : (What! How did they know where you were?)
7351 : ...
7352 : (Hey! We'll meet again, yes? Gukool Ja! Answer me!)
7353 : Gukool Ja...
7354 : You set the % in the glowing trench.
7355 : The % is giving off an enigmatic light.
7356 : The % is gone!
7357 : The % shows the ocean as seen from the eyes of the seagull... He used to love saying that...
7358 : Long time no see... I knew we'd meet again.
7359 : Hm? You buried something here? Why, I have no idea what you're talking about...
7360 : Oh, do you doubt me? How terrible...even though I was so nice to you earlier.
7361 : So the Seagull Phratrie is searching for the %, is it? Looks like they're getting desperate now, aren't they?
7362 : Oh yes... Did you say hello to Qultada for me?
7363 : Did you? Yes, I told him. How should I remember?
7364 : That's odd... I wonder why he hasn't shown his face yet, then...
7365 : I guess I should have made myself a bit...clearer.
7366 : I see you've got some nerve. You should watch your mouth, though...
7367 : Or you might end up swimming with the fishes in the Cyan Deep!
7368 : You need to learn to stay out of Phratrie business.
7369 : Well, well, it looks like the star has arrived. Nice to see you, Qultada.
7370 : I heard your name from % and followed [him/her] here. I did not think you would stoop this far, though...
7371 : Imutira, you promised never to show your face to the Seagull Phratrie again.
7372 : Could you be wishing you put an end to me back then? How simply terrible of you.
7373 : Let's forget about the past, shall we? We never knew each other.
7374 : I just want to get along with everyone, you know.
7375 : Also, Qultada... You need %, don't you?
7376 : I just happen to have one right here. What a coincidence!
7377 : And, being the kind person I am, I'm thinking of giving it to my friends, the corsairs.
7378 : ...
7379 : Of course, I require something of you first.
7380 : I knew it.
7381 : Well then...
7382 : What do you want?
7383 : Oh no, I can't tell you in front of others... I'm far too shy.
7384 : %, return to Zweeha and tell her I'm going out on a little date, so I will be gone for a time.
7385 : Heheheh, my apologies.
7386 : Return to headquarters? It's time to go. No, I can't leave you!
7387 : Go. Captain's orders!
7388 : That's right... Go home and spend some time with your moogle, child.
7389 : Satisfied? Yes, I'm talking to you.
7390 : I knew I smelled a rat. You can't hide the stench of your dealings with the Immortals and the Imperial Army.
7391 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7392 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7393 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7394 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7395 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7396 : Now, listen close...
7397 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7398 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7399 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7400 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7401 : .........listen......
7402 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7403 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7404 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. Olduum(pt.1). Olduum(pt.2). Get the Picture. Give Peace a Chance. Navigating the Unfriendly Seas. Three Men and a Closet.

7408 : Nothing happens...
7409 : Press a button to continue.
7410 : An eerie red glow emanates from this stone platform. The surrounding air feels alive with energy...
7411 : Your % is responding to the platform...
7412 : You have a sense of foreboding...
7413 : Bring the % closer? Here goes... Ah, maybe not...
7414 : The % has been charged with the power of lightning!
7415 : Place the % on the platform? Here goes... Ah, maybe not...
7416 : Nothing happens. Could the power of the ruins have been drained...?
7417 : Your % is responding strongly to the platform... You sense some strange connection...
7418 : Harvesting is possible here if you have %.
7419 : Probability of loss = #/10000.
7420 : Your % breaks!
7421 : You successfully harvest %!
7422 : You harvest %, but your % breaks.
7423 : You are unable to harvest anything.
7424 : You cannot carry any more items. Your inventory is full.
7425 : Obtained key item: %!
7426 : You have a feeling you might find something here!
7427 : A sudden chill sweeps over you...
7438 : The Mamool Ja Savages are on the move. Intercept their forces in the Wajaom Woodlands!
7439 : The Troll Mercenaries are on the move. Intercept their forces in the Wajaom Woodlands!
7440 : The Undead Swarm is on the move. Intercept their forces in Bhaflau Thickets!
7441 : The Mamool Ja Savages have breached the Balrahn Defense Line! Intercept their forces in Al Zahbi's Bastion!
7442 : The Troll Mercenaries have breached the Balrahn Defense Line! Intercept their forces in Al Zahbi's Bastion!
7443 : The Undead Swarm has breached the Balrahn Defense Line! Intercept their forces in Al Zahbi's Bastion!
7444 : Al Zahbi is Besieged! Defend the Astral Candescence!
7445 : Al Zahbi is no longer Besieged.
7446 : The beastmen have retreated.
7447 : The Mamool Ja Savages have retreated.
7448 : The Troll Mercenaries have retreated.
7449 : The Undead Swarm has retreated.
7450 : Al Zahbi has recovered the Astral Candescence.
7451 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The beastmen have taken the Astral Candescence.
7452 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The Mamool Ja Savages have taken the Astral Candescence.
7453 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The Troll Mercenaries have taken the Astral Candescence.
7454 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The Undead Swarm has taken the Astral Candescence.
7455 : The water in this spring is an unusual color...
7456 : You collect a sample of the water.
7457 : You no longer need the water from this spring.
7458 : You do not need any more water from this spring.
7459 : % presses the % into the Warhorse Hoofprint!
7460 : Forgive, I will not. My pet, you hurt!
7461 : I was wondering whether you would have the nerve to show up.
7462 : (It has been quite long since I last engaged the enemy with someone other than Bashraf or Wahboud.)
7463 : (Ever since our first assignment as mercenaries, where one has gone the others have followed--from the pubs where we drank our ales, to the inns where we rested our weary bones after a foray on a heathen camp.)
7464 : (Even Lady Naja made it a point to ensure we worked together.)
7465 : (Quite impressive...for a common adventurer. Though, [he/she] allows me absolutely no opportunity to exhibit my talents.)
7466 : Wow, Wahboud! That's the most amazing thing I've seen in my life! You're the greatest fighter ever!
7467 : (Could that be...Bashraf?)
7468 : You know, this is great and all, but don't you think we should call Foudeel?
7469 : But...
7470 : He can't be too busy, right?
7471 : But... We were having so much fun with just the two of us. We can make it if we try!
7472 : ("Just the two of us?")
7473 : I apologize, %. Our little banter in the bushes has left me quite fatigued. I feel I should take my leave now.
7474 : What are you talking about? You know the saying: Three's company, two's...two's...two's not! If we're not a company, then what are we, Bash?
7475 : I'm sorry... You're right, Wahboud...
7476 : You know I am! When have I ever been wrong? Now let's go back and find Foudeel!
7477 : Hello...?
7478 : I rarely meet another soul out here.
7479 : Gaweesh is worried about me, you say?
7480 : I'm sorry you were sent out here for such a trivial matter...
7481 : Please let him know that I'll return shortly.
7482 : ...?
7483 : Wait...
7484 : Is that...%?
7485 : Were you just going to take it...?
7486 : Do you know what that is?
7487 : Well, I suppose you wouldn't.
7488 : I doubt it would have much value for anyone but myself.
7489 : This precious arrow reminds me of an event I never want to forget.
7490 : I visit this place sometimes to fit it to my bow and relive one of the most trying moments in my life...
7491 : Stay a while, and I'll tell you the tale.
7492 : The tale that hinges on that single arrow...
7493 : It was a time when the beastman invasion of the Empire's western lands was far less threatening than it is today.
7494 : I had injured my shoulder while fighting as an archer on the eastern front...
7495 : Al Zahbi was considered a quiet post, and I was transferred here for a chance to heal my wound.
7496 : This also happened to be the city where my younger brother was stationed...
7497 : Hey, isn't that Lady Najelith, the famous archer? She's supposed to be convalescing here, but she looks pretty strong to me!
7498 : I hear she pierced the helmet of an enemy general with one shot when he poked his head up over a siege wall for just a moment too long...
7499 : Seems a little far-fetched. I mean, she seems so...passive.
7500 : Yes, I expected someone a little more striking.
7501 : I wouldn't judge her by her demeanor. Her father is Instructor Taira, a famous bowmaster that teaches archery to the Imperial soldiers.
7502 : Isn't that a Far Eastern name?
7503 : He probably betrayed his own nation to gain prestige--and a respected position--in ours.
7504 : No, no! I've seen some of his techniques in action.
7505 : He can hit a target the size of a Qiqirn's head from the back of a galloping chocobo!
7506 : Well, even if that's so, it doesn't mean his talent has been passed on to his children.
7507 : Children...?
7508 : Lady Najelith is Ryaaf's older sister.
7509 : Really!?
7510 : Ryaaf the Rat? That Ryaaf?
7511 : I saw his military records once. I'm sure of it.
7512 : So Ryaaf is her younger brother. That proves talent isn't hereditary...
7513 : She's looking over here.
7514 : Has my brother done something?
7515 : No, nothing, Lady Najelith...
7516 : That's good to hear.
7517 : Are you on duty today, Lady Najelith?
7518 : No, I've taken the day off to celebrate my brother's birthday.
7519 : What brings you to the palace?
7520 : There is a portrait of Balrahn that hangs within the Imperial grounds. Ryaaf has always been very fond of the hat he wears in the picture.
7521 : And so you braved the palace bureaucracy to research the design? You're quite devoted to your brother.
7522 : Well, he took very good care of me while I was wounded...
7523 : Does it still pain you?
7524 : No, the injury is almost fully healed now. If you'll excuse me, I must be on my way...
7525 : ...
7526 : Such a gentle soul. I can't imagine the grief her brother must bring her.
7527 : He's quite a handful...
7528 : Najelith.
7529 : ...
7530 : Najelith!
7531 : Oh, Ryaaf!
7532 : Sorry I'm late--you wouldn't believe how many forms you have to fill out before they let you tour the palace grounds.
7533 : Um, Najelith...?
7534 : Shall we go find a place to eat, or would you prefer I made you dinner in the barracks?
7535 : I've been learning how to bake while my injury heals...
7536 : That's...that's okay. Actually, I have something I wanted to ask you.
7537 : Hehehe...
7538 : I know, you want your birthday present, right?
7539 : It's a very stylish hat. The materials may end up costing a coin or two, though...
7540 : But don't you worry about that. If I sell my medal of valor, we should be able to afford it.
7541 : No, that's not what I--
7542 : It's fine. Really. What do I need a medal like that for? To let my enemies know I've been wounded?
7543 : Najelith, would you just listen!
7544 : What is it, Ryaaf?
7545 : I'm glad that we have all this time together now that we're in the same battalion, but you and I are soldiers, right?
7546 : I want you to stop all this.
7547 : All this?
7548 : All this looking out for little brother behavior.
7549 : But why? You are my little brother, after all.
7550 : I'm a full-fledged soldier in the Imperial Army. I don't need you treating me like a child.
7551 : I never meant to...
7552 : After our mother died so young, I just felt that I--
7553 : I appreciate all you've done for me, I really do.
7554 : But things have changed. You may not have noticed, but people recognize you here.
7555 : I'm tired of being compared to my talented older sister.
7556 : I want to be recognized on my own merits, not as the brother of Najelith, the incomparable archer!
7557 : Ryaaf...
7558 : This is the city. There will always be people who will try to put you down.
7559 : But you can't let it affect you. You are my wonderful, irreplaceable little brother...
7560 : That's not enough for me.
7561 : One day soon I'll be as skilled a soldier as you are!
7562 : I'm sure of it. I believe in you.
7563 : You just...you don't understand. But you will...
7564 : What do you mean...?
7565 : Najelith! What are you doing here?
7566 : I'm off duty today...
7567 : I'm sorry to hear that, but we have an emergency situation. You must return to headquarters immediately.
7568 : I can't, I have to go have a hat made for--
7569 : The captain has asked for you specifically--some sort of special mission.
7570 : Ryaaf, I...
7571 : You have your duty. You should go, Najelith.
7572 : Your skills may lessen the amount of blood that could be spilled.
7573 : Okay, but I want to continue this conversation when my mission is over.
7574 : ...
7575 : Farewell, Najelith.
7576 : This is the last time you'll see me as your little brother.
7577 : Zorhorzur the Golden has mobilized the Trolls under his command...
7578 : And we anticipate that he will lead this rogue group in an assault on the capital.
7579 : Ordinarily we would welcome the attack of a small splinter group, but...
7580 : But you need more time to finish repairs on the city walls.
7581 : Exactly.
7582 : You can count on me, sir.
7583 : Are you up to it?
7584 : Najelith, your wound has not completely healed!
7585 : It's a little stiff, but I can still draw my bow.
7586 : That is welcome news.
7587 : I've seen you spit a chigoe at a hundred yalms. I'm certain Zorhorzur will be worm food before he gets to within twice that distance.
7588 : I'll send our request for mission approval to Operations immediately.
7589 : Wait...
7590 : By the time we've cut through all that red tape, we may have lost the enemy's position and the chance to strike a blow from afar.
7591 : I don't wish to place the citizens of this city in any danger.
7592 : But without permission from Operations, we'll have no reinforcements.
7593 : I need no reinforcements. I'll have less chance of being detected if I go alone.
7594 : As your superior, I cannot allow you to undertake such a reckless--
7595 : Captain, I'm off duty, remember? If a group of Trolls happens to interrupt my picnic in the woods, well...
7596 : ...
7597 : Very well.
7598 : Najelith, set up a sniper post on Giwahb Watchtower in the northwest of the Wajaom Woodlands.
7599 : We believe Zorhorzur will pass by there on his way to Al Zahbi.
7600 : Understood.
7601 : We have no further intelligence on this situation. If you feel you are in any danger, you are to abandon the mission and report in.
7602 : I will have a support unit ready to come to your aid.
7603 : Thank you, Captain.
7604 : Najelith, you are to set out with all haste. The rest of you, be prepared for battle at a moment's notice.
7605 : Najelith.
7606 : Sir.
7607 : It's not that I lack faith in your skill, but something tells me you're going to run into trouble out there.
7608 : I believe it's about time I took a day off as well.
7609 : But, Captain...
7610 : Dalbab, clear things with Operation in my stead.
7611 : Sir. Be careful, sir.
7612 : Zalwan, you weren't busy today, were you?
7613 : No, Captain.
7614 : I need a messenger. Come join the picnic.
7615 : I'd love to, sir.
7616 : Now, if only we had time to pack a hamper...
7617 : I'll remember that for next time, Captain.
7618 : Ahahaha!
7619 : Anything?
7620 : ...
7621 : Nothing yet, sir.
7622 : Hmm, perhaps this Zorhorzur had a change of heart...or just got hungry and went home...
7623 : Here they come...
7624 : I don't see anything...
7625 : You will soon enough. Their footfalls...something's not right...
7626 : There!
7627 : How strange...
7628 : The Trolls are rushing around like they're in a blood frenzy...but I don't see any reason why...
7629 : This is going to make it hard to pick off their leader!
7630 : Do they mean to charge in a wild rage the entire way to the capital!?
7631 : I'll try to make the shot. Even one less enemy Troll will be a blessing...
7632 : Stay your bow. We only have one chance at this--you should know better than to waste it on grunts.
7633 : ...?
7634 : There's someone...
7635 : Ryaaf!?
7636 : Ryaaf!!!
7637 : What is he doing out here!? He's supposed to be safely behind the city walls!
7638 : How do I help him...?
7639 : Najelith! It's Zorhorzur! What are you waiting for!? Take the shot!
7640 : But...but I could hit Ryaaf!
7641 : Dammit, how did he get into the middle of all this!?
7642 : I'm sure I don't know, sir. But he definitely has Zorhorzur's attention.
7643 : Why...?
7644 : Quickly, Najelith!
7645 : Your brother has angered the Trolls. There's no saving him now, no matter what we do.
7646 : !?
7647 : If we fail here, there's nothing to stop that raging horde from reaching Al Zahbi.
7648 : Too many lives are at stake. Shoot that great brute!
7649 : ...
7650 : If you can't make that shot...
7651 : ...aim for Ryaaf.
7652 : !!!
7653 : The Trolls will have the object of their wrath, and hopefully return to Halvung for a time.
7654 : We need time to bolster our defenses...
7655 : How can you ask such a thing!?
7656 : Listen to me, Najelith. You are the only archer I know who can put an arrow through Troll armor.
7657 : Take the shot. Whether it hits Zorhorzur or Ryaaf, the capital will be spared...
7658 : There is no other choice. Najelith!!!
7659 : ...
7660 : I cannot...! I cannot risk my brother's life!
7661 : Najelith!
7662 : I cannot...
7663 : They've disappeared into the trees! That dolt is leading them straight to the capital...
7664 : We're too late. Our mission has failed.
7665 : Zalwan, inform Operations of the situation immeditately!
7666 : Sir.
7667 : Najelith, I...
7668 : I thought I could do it.
7669 : I learned of the Trolls' route from a rumormonger...
7670 : I lay in wait, thinking I could surprise their leader, slay him, then steal away before the rest could react.
7671 : I would have saved the city...
7672 : And then...and then people would respect me like they respect you.
7673 : I never imagined Zorhorzur would be so strong...
7674 : So very, very strong...
7675 : ...
7676 : Did you hear?
7677 : Yes...
7678 : Such a tragic story. How many people were lost because of her...?
7679 : Just terrible...
7680 : How could she freeze up at such a crucial moment and allow those brutes in to terrorize the city?
7681 : Master archer, indeed. I'd be hiding my face too, if I were her.
7682 : They say Lady Najelith submitted a report detailing her transgression, and presented herself at the stockade...
7683 : What could be going through her mind?
7684 : I wonder what her punishment will be... Exile? Hanging? Beheading?
7685 : It seems unfair after all she's done for the Empire...
7686 : Najelith. The general is very serious about military conduct. If you persist on this course, your punishment will be harsh.
7687 : I'm willing to lend my voice to your cause. Please, reconsider your report.
7688 : ...
7689 : Why are you so eager to offer yourself for the chopping block? Our mission was not even officially sanctioned.
7690 : I appreciate your words, Captain. But I cannot forget or forgive a failure of this magnitude.
7691 : What about your brother? His period of confinement is almost at an end.
7692 : Some day, he will come to understand my decision...
7693 : Najelith...
7694 : Archer Najelith, Eleventh Archer Platoon, reporting for sentencing.
7695 : Enter.
7696 : Najelith, do you swear by Her Magnificence to speak no falsehoods?
7697 : I swear.
7698 : Very well. Now, to summarize your report...
7699 : You claim to have attempted to eliminate an enemy leader for personal glory. You also claim to have acted independently of orders during your off-duty hours.
7700 : You ignored orders from Captain Yashtra, who tried to dissuade you from your course, and proceeded to loose an arrow at the enemy, only to miss.
7701 : You then fled back to the city, essentially leading the Troll army right to our undefended doorstep.
7702 : Am I missing anything?
7703 : No, sir.
7704 : Do you mock me, soldier!?
7705 : No, sir, I had no intention of--
7706 : I have received reports from Captain Dalbab, Corporal Zalwan...
7707 : ...and Scout Ryaaf.
7709 : All of these reports are consistent...except yours. How do you explain this?
7710 : Am I to assume you filed a false statement?
7711 : No, sir, I--
7712 : In addition to your crimes against the Empire...
7713 : ...you have broken your oath to the Empress. Your sentence is passed.
7714 : Sir...
7715 : Do you have any last words before your punishment is carried out?
7716 : I do...
7717 : I have pursued excellence in archery, believing it would allow me to protect my family.
7718 : Even now, I don't truly know...
7719 : I don't know if I truly believe I should have fired that arrow without regard for my brother's life.
7720 : I don't know if I could fire that arrow should the same situation arise again.
7721 : You have lost confidence in your skill?
7722 : Yes...
7723 : My bow was useless. I didn't save a single person that day...
7724 : Not the citizens who were attacked... Not even my own brother!
7725 : If I had just been a little stronger.
7726 : If my aim had been a little more true...
7727 : ...
7728 : I...I deserve my punishment.
7729 : Your trial is over.
7730 : Najelith Taira.
7731 : For the crime of endangering Imperial citizens to protect your own flesh and blood...
7732 : ...you are sentenced to beheading.
7733 : Present yourself for execution.
7734 : ...
7735 : !?
7736 : This day, Najelith Taira was executed according to military law.
7737 : ...?
7738 : And Najelith Vareviya is appointed to the position of captain in the Skyserpent General's personal guard.
7739 : Why...?
7740 : You lament your lack of skill with the bow?
7741 : Yes, sir.
7742 : Nonsense!
7743 : What you lacked was the courage to act.
7744 : The courage to accept the possibility of losing something dear to you...
7745 : ...and the resolution to risk it for the greater good.
7746 : Najelith. You will fight under my banner in a sea of constant battle--and you will learn to master yourself.
7747 : Once you have mastered yourself, perhaps then you will truly be in a position to protect your brother.
7749 : You will also pay your debt to the Empire. The lives that were lost in this unfortunate incident will be balanced by the lives you save in battles to come.
7750 : A new weapon for a new day...
7751 : Sir.
7752 : I swear to make the most of this opportunity you have given me. I will atone for my crimes...
7753 : And that is my story...
7754 : The arrow you hold is the very same arrow I was unable to fire that day.
7755 : When was I appointed as the Galeserpent General, you ask?
7756 : That's a story for another time.
7757 : I still work to erase the damage caused by my indecision.
7758 : In my heart, that debt may never fully be repaid...
7759 : But my will is certainly stronger than before.
7760 : The Serpent Generals are a formidable group...
7761 : ...and fighting alongside such stalwart companions gives me strength.
7762 : And then there are mighty mercenaries such as you, of course.
7763 : Which reminds me, I don't believe you've introduced yourself...
7764 : %, is it?
7765 : Thank you for listening to my tale.
7766 : You have helped lighten the load on my spirit.
7767 : I look forward to seeing you beside me on the field of battle.
7768 : Hm? What brings you out here?
7769 : Talhaal said I would give you an interview? Who gave him permission to speak for my free time?
7770 : Sorry, but it'll have to wait. I'll find that damn trinket if it kills me...
7771 : Wait a minute. What's that you've got there?
7772 : Isn't that my old medal? Lemme see that!
7773 : I can't believe it. Where did you find it?
7774 : Well, whaddaya know. Ah, just looking at this thing takes me back...
7775 : Since you came all the way out here, you might as well stick around and listen to me reminisce.
7776 : You wanna hear what happened after I became a general?
7777 : I was supposed to have been put in charge of an elite unit... Well, those troops turned out to be green conscripts from the Empire's worst backwaters.
7778 : Most of them were violent types that were drafted into the army in place of serving a jail sentence.
7779 : I guess I was given the bad apples that nobody else wanted to deal with. Gahahahaha!
7780 : But you know, after facing death half a hundred times together, those boys and girls started to act like a real unit.
7781 : In six months they transformed into real soldiers you could trust to watch your back in a scrap.
7782 : Of course, I'd been subjecting them to my special brand of instruction the entire time.
7783 : That was about when it happened...
7784 : Well, if it isn't General Zazarg. How goes the patrol?
7785 : Greetings, Whamaad. How's the shoulder healing up?
7786 : Very well, thanks to that ointment you suggested. Here, look at this...
7787 : That's good to see.
7788 : Hehehe...
7789 : But make sure you take it easy, old timer. Your granddaughter will have my head on a pike.
7790 : Ohoho, I'm still a spring chicken compared to you, General Zazarg.
7791 : Gahahahaha! I'll give you that one!
7792 : General Zazarg!
7793 : What is it?
7794 : Some foreign sailors that beached their ship on Imperial soil just a while ago are causing a commotion down at the port.
7795 : Foreign sailors? What am I, immigration control? Tell them to round up the troublemakers and send them off to the Immortals.
7796 : It...it's just that these troublemakers are calling for you by name...
7797 : For me?
7798 : Marines from the Maelstrom Company are dealing with them right now, but...
7799 : I thought it best if you were informed.
7800 : I see. Thank you, soldier.
7801 : I guess I better go see what this is all about. Take things slowly, Whamaad!
7802 : I'm telling you!
7803 : We're just Bastokan fishermen that were caught up in a storm...
7804 : Hmph, do fishermen from Bastok usually dress in full plate armor? You must have some nasty sea life over there!
7805 : If you could just tell Zazarg that we're here, he'll clear everything up. He's a distant relative of mine.
7806 : You do know that General Zazarg is a Galka?
7807 : I said distant... !!!
7808 : Lads!
7809 : Cap...Cousin Zazarg!
7810 : You look well, sir...
7811 : Gahahaha! What are you boys doing here?
7812 : Do you know this riffraff, General?
7813 : I'll vouch for them, yes.
7814 : Then I'll release them into your custody...
7815 : I would advise keeping this quiet from the Immortals. You know how they get.
7816 : I'll keep that in mind.
7817 : Now, what's gotten into you lot?
7818 : Ever since you left, the Gold Musketeers have slowly been strangled with rules and discipline.
7819 : Those of us who were under your command are being weeded out...
7820 : When we heard rumors that you'd been made a general here, we had to come and see it for ourselves.
7821 : Captain! We want to take orders from you again! We'll show this country what a real squad of soldiers can do!
7822 : You know...
7823 : I seem to recall asking you lads to take care of Bastok while I was gone.
7824 : Yeah, you did say something along those lines...
7825 : Go home! I don't wanna see your ugly mugs here again!
7826 : Captain...!
7827 : So? What's the deal with this crew?
7828 : They claim to be fishermen...but anyone with eyes can see they are Bastokan spies. From an inner circle of government, I would guess.
7829 : Explain yerself.
7830 : It's obvious that General Zazarg is acquainted with those men.
7831 : Well, isn't that interestin'?
7832 : Sir. I would also conjecture that this meeting was planned to take place in a less public place...
7833 : Stroke o' luck that we found them first. Let's wrap this up before the Immortals get a whiff of the action.
7834 : Sir. Yes, sir.
7835 : Hehehe... I can't wait to see that great oaf squealin' like a pig...
7836 : Go on! Get outta here!
7837 : Do you mean to abandon your families?
7838 : But, Captain...!
7839 : General Zazarg?
7840 : What is it? Can't you see I'm busy?
7841 : We have some questions for you. Would you accompany me, please?
7842 : General Zazarg! Is anything wrong?
7843 : The port is under our jurisdiction. This is none of your affair.
7844 : It becomes our affair when you try to arrest our commanding officer.
7845 : Did you think we'd just stand by and let you take him away!?
7846 : You'll all be arrested for aiding a suspected criminal.
7847 : Is that right? We'll see how much arresting you do when you're looking for your teeth on the cobblestones!
7848 : Knock it off!
7849 : ...
7850 : Al Zahbi is under attack!
7851 : The Mamool Ja Savages have breached the Balrahn Defense Line!
7852 : They are advancing on the Imperial capital!
7853 : Martial law has been declared in Al Zahbi! Repeating... Martial law has been declared in Al Zahbi!
7854 : Dammit, not now!
7855 : Guess we'll have to have that chat another time, hey?
7856 : Maybe you should be heading back to your base.
7857 : This isn't over!
7858 : Listen up. The lizardmen are headed for the west gate!
7859 : We must blunt the initial assault. Prepare the defenses!
7860 : Sir! Yes, sir!
7861 : What about us?
7862 : Ah, you lads... Come with me, then!
7863 : Sir!
7864 : General Zazarg. I've been looking for you.
7865 : ...
7866 : Actually, boys, you better stay here until I call for you.
7867 : Sir...
7868 : What do you make of it?
7869 : It looks like a diversionary tactic, just as you suspected.
7870 : The force at the west gate is doing its best to keep our attention.
7871 : I would guess that the main thrust of their army is headed towards the signal tower...or the rear gate.
7872 : !!!
7873 : The southern gate! It's still under repairs after some cur tried to burn it down.
7874 : We must send reinforcements immediately!
7875 : We have no troops in reserve. Even the mercenaries have been deployed...
7876 : Wait. Where are you going!?
7877 : I can handle a few lizardmen. You just worry about overseeing the battle here, General Rughadjeen.
7878 : Captain!
7879 : What the...!
7880 : !?
7881 : We didn't come all this way to watch you get yourself killed. We're with you.
7882 : You stubborn... Ah, to hell with it.
7883 : Let's teach those beastmen to fear the Gold Musketeers!
7884 : Sir!
7885 : Yes, sir!
7886 : Charge!
7887 : May the winds of Walahra speed you on your way...
7888 : First, allow me to extend our gratitude. Your defense of the southern gate against overwhelming odds was nothing less than miraculous.
7889 : Her Magnificence also expresses her appreciation.
7890 : However, I regret to inform you that I have other reasons for calling you here.
7891 : General...
7892 : You stated to me that you had left the Gold Musketeers, and retained no ties with your former compatriots.
7893 : That is correct, sir.
7894 : Then how do you explain these warriors behind you?
7895 : The general had no idea we were coming...
7896 : Hmm, I'm sure there are perfectly valid excuses for your presence.
7897 : I hear these men played a vital role in repelling the invaders. They appear to be competent and trustworthy soldiers.
7898 : However, we cannot ignore military law. It would send the wrong message to our soldiers. Do you understand?
7899 : Sir.
7900 : Your punishment will be meted out presently.
7901 : The troops hold you in high esteem...
7902 : However, there are many high-ranking officers that follow your actions with suspicion.
7903 : ...
7904 : If I may, Grand Vizier?
7905 : Speak.
7906 : I am an outsider in the Imperial Army, and I can never repay the generosity of Her Magnificence.
7907 : I am also formerly a proud member of the Gold Musketeers--an organization that strictly enforces military discipline.
7908 : I willingly accept any punishment I am due.
7909 : C-Captain!
7910 : However!
7911 : It is said that these men deserted their unit, and attempted to enter the Empire illegally.
7912 : The Gold Musketeers pledge their bodies and souls in the defense of their nation and its people.
7913 : These irresponsible curs could never be the men I trained in the Gold Musketeers!
7914 : They are not worthy of the name!
7915 : ...
7916 : Then you submit that these men are nothing more than simple fishermen?
7917 : Sir.
7918 : ...
7919 : If necessary, I'll thrash them to within an inch of their lives and throw them back into the ocean myself.
7920 : Captain! How could you!?
7921 : Silence!
7922 : ...
7923 : Well, we can hardly hold you responsible for the actions of some wayward fishermen.
7924 : And we cannot forget that they were instrumental in protecting the capital from invasion.
7925 : ...
7926 : General Rughadjeen. I leave matters in your capable hands.
7927 : Sir.
7928 : The Empire thanks you for your courage.
7929 : Sir...
7930 : We never meant to cause so much trouble...
7931 : Everything turned out for the best.
7932 : If it wasn't for you boys, I'd probably be stuffed and served in a Mamool Ja banquet by now.
7933 : Gahahahaha!
7934 : Give my regards to the lads in Bastok.
7935 : Sir!
7936 : Take care of yourself, Captain.
7937 : The same goes for you.
7938 : There's something else...
7939 : What? The food here giving you a bellyache?
7940 : This is yours...
7941 : A Republican Iron Medal...
7942 : I received this when I was still in the Bastokan Regulars. How did you...?
7943 : Let's just say a friend of yours was holding on to it.
7944 : A friend of mine? Speak clearly, man.
7945 : We were told not to say anything. But that ship we came here in...
7946 : It was actually organized by Iron Eater.
7947 : !?
7948 : If you were miserable here, we were supposed to throw you in the boat and bring you home.
7949 : What!?
7950 : And if you wanted to stay, but things were tough, we were told to show you the medal to cheer you up...
7951 : Gahahahaha! Do I look like I need babysitting?
7952 : You tell Iron Eater this:
7953 : This nation has need of my fists.
7954 : But if he ever deprives Bastok of its finest soldiers ever again, I'll bring my fists back there and knock some sense into him.
7955 : Hehe, good to see this place hasn't changed you, sir!
7956 : Are the passengers ready? They are about to experience the height of teleportation excellence!
7957 : Go ahead.
7958 : I am delighted to offer my superlative spellcraft in service to the great General Zazarg.
7959 : Be well, lads!
7960 : Farewell!
7961 : May your fists never slow, Captain!
7962 : We're having a terrible time trying to suppress the rumors.
7963 : I apologize.
7964 : The command staff can barely keep up with the mountain of inquiries and thank-you letters regarding the efforts of those plate-armored fishermen.
7965 : Hehehe...
7966 : Hahaha...
7967 : There's no dampening your spirits, is there?
7968 : But those rumors will make it difficult for you to continue as an enlisted general.
7969 : Really? I hadn't paid much attention to them myself.
7970 : General Zazarg. I have been thinking...
7972 : From my observations, these beastman attacks on the capital will only increase in frequency.
7973 : I agree. Those lizardmen were in a frenzy to get inside the walls.
7974 : Exactly. In actual fact, I am in the process of gathering a core of talented generals at the behest of the Empress.
7975 : Our prime objective will be the defense of the Astral Candescence, the capital and its people, and the Empress Herself.
7976 : I could use your mighty fists and keen strategic mind. What say you?
7977 : General Rughadjeen...
7978 : Are you sure you want a foreign general in your little band?
7979 : What concerns me is your heart, not your nationality. You have shown amazing compassion for both our citizens and our troops.
7980 : Well, if you think you could use an old-fashioned soldier like me...
7981 : My fists are yours!
7982 : And that's how it all turned out...
7983 : But listen to me prattle on like an old woman.
7984 : You see what I mean, don't you?
7985 : That medal is a symbol of my connection with Bastok.
7986 : Even if it is a little rusty...
7987 : And this is the place where I first arrived in Aht Urhgan. The beginning of my new life, I guess you could say...
7988 : There I go again...babbling like a rookie back from his first battle.
7989 : Come to think of it, you're awful patient for a mercenary.
7990 : I bet you can't wait to jump back into the thick of things!
7991 : Gahahahaha!
7992 : The door is locked...
7993 : Your Imperial Standing has increased!
7994 : If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess % and have a high enough job level.
7995 : You can rent a chocobo for # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
7996 : You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.
7997 : If you still want one, it will cost you # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
7998 : Do you wish to rent a chocobo? Yes, I do. No, thank you.
7999 : You don't have enough gil.
8000 : You cannot obtain the %. Come back after sorting your inventory.
8001 : Would you be so kind as to deliver her to [the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?
8002 : Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo. First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of %.
8003 : Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of # Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have # Allied Notes.
8004 : Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
8005 : I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with %. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?
8006 : Ah, a mercenary. Just who I have been looking for.
8007 : I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to answer me truthfully.
8008 : Have you heard of Clavauert B Chanoix? Yes, I read the Tribune. No. Reading is for wimps.
8009 : Excellent, then I won't waste your time by giving you a history lesson.
8010 : You've never heard of the baron? Where have you been the past few years, off in some virtual fantasy world?
8011 : Clavauert B Chanoix is a famous zoologist from the Middle Lands.
8012 : He is currently visiting the Imperial realm on an expedition researching the behavioral patterns of various animals native to this continent.
8013 : The Empress has made it policy to officially sponsor the baron, and has ordered us to assist him in any way necessary.
8014 : Her Excellence feels that not only will his research provide a treasure trove of valuable information on the Empire's ecosystem...
8015 : ...but also help us better defend ourselves.
8016 : Why is that, you ask?
8017 : Simply put, data on the monsters living in the area will aid us in determining the best plan of action to take when threatened by the foul fiends.
8018 : In the past weeks, the baron has been focusing his research on the recently discovered Poroggo. He is currently planning a trip into Mamook to take a closer look at the new species.
8019 : And that is where the Empire requires your help. We need someone to act as a bodyguard for Professor Chanoix while he collects his data.
8020 : You need worry not. A hefty reward will be provided for your services, in addition to the fame and glory you will receive by accepting such an important mission.
8021 : Well, what is your answer, mercenary?
8022 : Accept the job? Yes. Not now.
8023 : Understood. However, if you have a change of heart, the position will remain open until we find another volunteer.
8024 : Wonderful. I will contact the baron right awa--
8025 : Ah!
8026 : Maudaal. Have you not yet found me a bodyguard? I do grow weary of these gray walls and long to step back out into the wild woods of Wajaom.
8027 : Baron Chanoix! Your timing is impeccable!
8028 : This fine citizen has just volunteered for the position.
8029 : Excellent! Now I can finally continue my research.
8030 : First, let me inform you of the focal point of this expedition.
8031 : Are you familiar with the peculiar beastman known as the Poroggo?
8032 : Are you? I'm an expert! Prego?
8033 : Is that so? You adventurers never cease to amaze me with your knowledge of the world.
8034 : You mean to tell me that you have no prior knowledge of the Poroggo?
8035 : And you believe that this uneducated commoner will be able to effectively assist me in my research?
8036 : Well, that is of no matter. At least you were honest about your ignorance--unlike my friend Maudaal here...
8037 : Now listen carefully, as I shall give you a quick overview of the data I have collected thus far.
8038 : You had best write this down!
8039 : Yes, I first came across the creatures when excavating a stratum of soil deep beneath Windurst Waters. In a layer we estimated to be nearly a hundred years old, my team discovered a large quantity of strangely shaped bones.
8040 : At first glance, they resembled the remains of large toads. However...
8041 : Measurements of the skulls showed us that the creatures had exceptionally large brains.
8042 : But that was not all--the forelegs seemed to be developed to the point that they might be used to grasp objects...
8043 : Whereas the hind legs seemed more suited for walking than the traditional jumping one might expect from an amphibious land dweller.
8044 : That was when I realized that we had not found the bones of a common toad, but a completely new and unique species!
8045 : I can sense what you are thinking...
8046 : It was as if we had discovered something directly from the pages of the well-known fairy tale, Poroggo and the Prince.
8047 : And it is indeed from the famous frog princess, Poroggo, that we took the name for our new beastman.
8048 : My theory was that over millions of years, the toads of Sarutabaruta adapted to their surroundings and evolved into this higher life form.
8049 : However!
8050 : I immediately took my findings to the Board of Akademia in Jeuno, but the fools simply laughed at me!
8051 : Yes, it is true, I had no explanation for the discovery of unevolved toad bones near those of the Poroggo...
8052 : But I knew that there had to be evidence that remained yet uncovered.
8053 : There had to be a missing link that would prove my theory!
8054 : And then, one day while poring over some of the Optistery's more sensitive tomes, I came across a most intriguing passage.
8055 : It said that...
8056 : ...the Poroggo we found in Windurst Waters...
8057 : ...they were actually toads transformed into hideous creatures by the forbidden magicks of an eccentric mage named Samariri!
8058 : It was difficult to accept that my original theory was incorrect.
8059 : However, as a scientist, it was the only choice with which I was left.
8060 : After my failure in Sarutabaruta, I felt I needed to put some distance between myself and the Middle Lands.
8061 : And that is when I decided to pack up my equipment and ventured forth here, to Aradjiah, in search of new knowledge.
8062 : And until recently, I have kept myself quietly busy with studies of the colibri and the chigoe.
8063 : That is until I received word of a Poroggo sighting in the Mamool Ja Savagelands!
8064 : According to the ancient tome I found in Windurst, all the Poroggo were exterminated by the Federation's mages immediately after their accidental creation. Though, ever since I discovered a peculiar footprint near the bungalow of my acquaintance, Pabool Ja, I have begun to believe otherwise.
8065 : Recently, there have even been adventurer reports of toadlike creatures residing in the damper areas of the Mamool Ja stronghold.
8066 : What I would like to find out is where these beastmen came from.
8067 : Are they descendants of the Poroggo spawned from the spellweaving of some spoiled Tarutaru?
8068 : Or, are they a completely different species, evolved from mere toads as stated in my original theory?
8069 : And! How are they able to transform their unexpecting victims into frogs?
8070 : The only way to come to satisfactory scientific conclusions is through research!
8071 : And research requires time!!
8072 : And so I planned an expedition into the savagelands to search out the elusive Poroggos and witness firsthand the instant a victim falls prey to their unique frog song.
8073 : But before I could set out on this trip, I required a volunteer...
8074 : ...to be that victim!
8075 : Ah, I'm sorry if I alarmed you. Your services will only be required to fend off...unwanted guests.
8076 : The noble Salwa-Molwa will be our guinea...er...toad.
8077 : So this is our mighty mercenary? Looks a bit scrawny, if you ask me.
8078 : I'm Salwa-Molwa.
8079 : I'll be helping the professor out with his experiment.
8080 : All you have to do is keep us alive while we're collecting the dataru.
8081 : Think you can handle that?
8082 : Salwa!
8083 : Mikilulu!? What are you doing here?
8084 : Are you really thinking about going through with this crazy scheme? What if you become a frog forever!?
8085 : What are you worried about, baby? I've got the baron to protect me...and this mercenary, too. They'll help me out of any jam.
8086 : How am I supposed to trust a so-called professor who would think of doing experiments on living, breathing Tarutaru!?
8087 : Hey! Watch your mouth in front of the big B!
8088 : Professor Chanoix is a respected member of society. Do you think he'd do anything to harm his fellow man?
8089 : And think of this mercenary's feelings!
8090 : [He/She] looks like [he/she] hasn't had any decent work for months. You wouldn't want to ruin this for [him/her] now, would you?
8091 : And what about my feelings!? Are you saying that I'm too weak to find a way to break a measly frog curse on my own? Well, bring it on, I say!
8092 : If you'd like to know, I've been spending the last eight days practicing on how to act once I'm transformed. So there!
8093 : Ribbit, ribbit, baby!
8094 : Huh!?
8095 : How is practicing to be a frog going to help you return to normal!?
8096 : It's... Uh... Um... What do you know, anyway!?
8097 : You see, the real reason I'm doing this is for the green! The gil, baby!
8098 : I don't care about any money!
8099 : Can't you see I'm just worried about your safety!?
8100 : Pshhh. Whatever. Now scram, sweetcheeks. We men've got important business to attend to.
8101 : Ugh! I don't know why I put up with you!
8102 : But let me just say one thing before I go...
8103 : If you come back a frog...
8104 : ...you won't be getting any more sugar from this candy cane!
8105 : What's with her?
8106 : I was kind of hoping that if I was stuck as a frog, she'd kiss me and I'd magically transform back to normal...just like in that fairy tale.
8107 : <Grumble, grumble>...
8108 : Ah! Oh! A thousand apologies, Professor Chanoix!
8109 : Mikilulu obviously cannot fathom the importance of your research (or the reward that accompanies it).
8110 : You don't need to worry, sir! I'm still your loyal servant!
8111 : Though I'm unworthy to even kneel in the light of your zoological greatness...
8112 : ...I'll be the best guinea toad you've ever worked with!
8113 : That's the spirit, Salwa-Molwa! I'm counting on you!
8114 : Now, as for our rendezvous point. Are you familiar with the secret exit to the Wajaom Woodlands?
8115 : I shall be waiting there for the both of you.
8116 : And do not be late!
8117 : Hey, mercenary-[guy/lady], I know you probably took this job for the reward, but I'd like to ask you...
8118 : Do you think there's anything in this world more important than money?
8119 : Well do you? Yeah. Puppies are pretty nice. No. Even puppies pale to money.
8120 : You see...
8121 : When this job's over, I'm going to ask my sweetheart Mikilulu to marry me.
8122 : That's why I'm going through with this. I'm not doing it for the money like I said.
8123 : It's just, I can't tell Mikilulu that yet.
8124 : Getting married is a serious thing, but I don't think I'm ready yet. I'm still the same, weak boy that got his butt kicked on the Ballista courts back at boarding school.
8125 : Before I even try to prove to Miki that I can protect her, I have to prove to myself that I can.
8126 : See? I know what I'm doing! I just wish Miki understood as well...
8127 : I mean, I can see why she is worried and all, but I didn't think she would be so unreasonable!
8128 : I guess I could sit her down and explain everything, but then she'd just get all teary-eyed like she always does...
8129 : Oh, sorry about that.
8130 : I didn't mean to put any extra pressure on you or anything. (Though, Miki would be devastated if anything were to happen to me on this mission...)
8131 : Anyway, Miki's happiness is riding on my performance here.
8132 : And if I have to become a frog thirty times over to prove my love to her, then so be it!
8133 : Once you've made your preparations, you know where to meet me and the B.
8134 : See you around!
8135 : Ah, quite punctual of you, %.
8136 : As swift as a raptor, one might say.
8137 : I should expect nothing less from a seasoned mercenary like yourself.
8138 : Now, if only all my help were as competent...
8139 : Where on Vana'diel could that nimwit be!?
8140 : You're late, %! As laggard as a wamouracampa, one might say.
8141 : And you call yourself a mercenary... It is a wonder the Empire can thrive when protected by such a pitiful army of skivers.
8142 : If you were working with my research team, you'd be fired before you stepped in the door. Why, you even make that assistant of mine, Atelloune, look like the Goddess Herself!
8143 : And it seems your tendency towards tardiness is not necessarily a unique trait...
8144 : Late! Late! Late! I'm gonna be lataru!
8145 : Ulp! You guys haven't been waiting too long for me, I hope.
8146 : Ahem! I apologize deeply for my delayed arrival, and humbly beg your forgiveness.
8147 : Salwa the Unworthy, at your service.
8148 : I would've been here earlier, but I thought we were supposed to meet at the exit to Bhaflau!
8149 : Fool!
8150 : How many times have I told you, I am not a man to be kept waiting!
8151 : Or perhaps you thought we were going on a picnic to the countryside?
8152 : Look at this fine mercenary, all ready to embark on our important mission. At least one of you has some sense of responsibility.
8153 : Do not forget, Salwa-Molwa, there are thousands more Tarutaru where you came from. I'm sure I can find another to assist me!
8154 : I-I'm sorry, Your Professorship! Please forgive me! It won't happen again!
8155 : You are lucky I don't bend you across my knee and give you a good flogging! Maybe that would teach you a lesson!
8156 : I seriously worry about the success of my research...
8157 : But enough of this idle chit-chat. I guess there is only one way to see if you have truly learned your lesson.
8158 : %. Am I safe to assume that you are familiar with the quickest route to Mamo--?
8159 : <Yawn>...
8160 : What sort of enchantment is this?
8161 : Hm? Where is our little friend!?
8162 : %! And you call yourself a bodyguard! It has been less than an hour and you have already succeeded in losing one of my team!
8163 : Luckily it was just Salwa, but what if it had been me!?
8164 : While I do not like the idea of losing precious research time...
8165 : ...I suppose we should locate the lost chap.
8166 : However, I haven't the slightest of ideas where to begin searching.
8167 : What about you? Did you happen to see anything while you were lounging there on the leaves?
8168 : I thought I saw... A toad chasing a Poroggo! A Tarutaru chasing a toad! A Tarutaru chasing a Poroggo!
8169 : Amazing! You say you saw an actual Poroggo!?
8170 : Let me see... Then we can assume the toad you saw chasing after it would be none other than Salwa-Molwa!
8171 : ...... How dare he go and transform without allowing me time to make my observations! If he is still expecting pay in full for this debacle, then he is gravely mistaken!
8172 : !? You say you witnessed a Tarutaru chasing a toad?
8173 : We can assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world has he chosen to run off and leave us here?
8174 : Perhaps the toad placed a powerful charm spell on him... But why would it do that?
8175 : No... I believe this is the scheming of a Poroggo.
8176 : You must have simply mistaken the beastman for a common toad--an oversight easily understandable, coming from an uneducated lay[man/woman] such as yourself.
8177 : What is this!? You say you witnessed a Tarutaru pursuing a Poroggo!?
8178 : We can safely assume that the Tarutaru was Salwa-Molwa. However, why in the world would he be chasing away the very beastman we seek?
8179 : There is also the possibility that he was put under a powerful charm spell... But if that is indeed the case, why wasn't he transformed into a toad as well...?
8180 : Either way, it seems best if we continue our expedition as planned.
8181 : If a Poroggo truly was involved in Salwa's disappearance, then we shall find both of them in Mamook.
8182 : My data tells us that the Poroggo mating grounds lie in an area accessible from an entrance located on the western side of this forest.
8183 : Now let us make haste.
8184 : <Sigh>... Perhaps this encounter with the Poroggo is a blessing in disguise.
8185 : However, if that is the case, why did they kidnap that useless Salwa?
8186 : Hm!? This whole situation is quite similar to that old fairy tale...
8187 : I'm sure you have heard of it: Poroggo and the Prince.
8188 : One day, a young Tarutaru is in the forest collecting toadstools when the frog princess, Poroggo, falls in love with the poor boy and carries him away to her underwater kingdom.
8189 : Though Salwa-Molwa is not exactly what you could call young, I can't imagine anyone, even an amphibian, taking a fancy in that numbskull.
8190 : Oh, do not misunderstand me, %.
8191 : I'm not saying that this fairy tale has any basis in truth.
8192 : The act of mixing fact with fiction has no place in the world of science.
8193 : Truth can only be defined as what we can see with our own eyes, grasp with our own hands.
8194 : There must be a logical explanation for what happened to Salwa.
8195 : It is just that we have yet to determine it.
8196 : Now, off to Mamook!
8197 : Professor!
8198 : Hm!?
8199 : Mikilulu! She's-- I've-- It's-- We've-- Toad!
8200 : Well, if it isn't Salwa-Molwa...
8201 : % and I were just about to set off in search of you.
8202 : However, it seems that you, in turn, have found us. All's well that ends well, I suppose.
8203 : Now, why don't you calm down and explain to us what has befallen you...starting with that unfortunate occurrence in Wajaom.
8204 : You see, you two were still sleeping when I recovered from the spell. I looked around to see if I couldn't spot the fiend that had put us in this predicament...
8205 : ...when I saw my precious Mikilulu...
8206 : ...being turned into a frog!
8207 : I tried to catch her so you could help break the curse, but for some reason, she started hopping off in the direction of Mamook!
8208 : I knew % would take care of you, Professor, so I left you two there in the woods to chase after Miki.
8209 : So it was just as you explained, %.
8210 : (You must have the eyes of a pugil, %. His account of the events is absolutely nothing like what you claim to have seen!)
8211 : Anyway, I tried my best to catch my poor sweetheart, but she was just too slick and slimy.
8212 : And before I knew it, I found myself in the middle of the forest. Miki had stopped near a tree and I was just about to sneak up and grab her...
8213 : ...when I saw her jump towards a shadow that was probably a terrible monster! It was a Poroggo, I tell you!
8214 : And I'd bet my grandma's subligar that it was the same one that put us to sleep!
8215 : Hmmm... An interesting story...
8216 : Though one aspect of the tale makes little sense--what was this female acquaintance of yours doing in the Wajaom Woodlands in the first place?
8217 : I don't know. She didn't tell me... I can only guess it was because she was worried about the experiment.
8218 : Oh! Why did it have to be Miki!? I was the one that was supposed to be transformed!
8219 : How scared she must be...
8220 : Calm down, calm down. Now, tell us what happened next.
8221 : Well, after what seemed like hours of chasing, the Poroggo finally ducked away into this cave...
8222 : ...and that's when I lost him...
8223 : I thought about searching for the frogman myself, but this place is crawling with hungry-looking Mamool Ja, and I wasn't planning on being a snack for those snakes.
8224 : Understood. We are left with no other choice than to locate and rescue this Mikilulu.
8225 : But how, Professor?
8226 : My recent studies of Poroggo behavior have led me to the following conclusions regarding the removal of their curses.
8227 : The first is that the effects of the frog song will simply wear off after time.
8228 : If we can catch your lady friend, then we need simply wait in a safe location until she returns to normal.
8229 : The second of my conclusions is a tad more dramatic.
8230 : In theory, the spell of the frog song can also be broken...
8231 : ...by slaying its caster.
8232 : While I hope it will not come to this, we may be forced to resort to violence if the Poroggo in question is not as cooperative as we may like.
8233 : Now, I am a man of science. I could never resort to killing a fellow living creature. That is where you come in, %.
8234 : Now, as for distinguishing 'your' toad from a more common specimen...
8235 : Professor! I think I can tell which one is my Miki!
8236 : I mean, I did chase her through the forest for almost an hour.
8237 : But even so, I'd know my own fiancee anywhere--frog or not!
8238 : Hmmm... While I do not question your feelings towards Mikilulu...
8239 : ...I am wary of basing our search efforts on the memory of a Tarutaru who cannot even remember at which gate he is to convene.
8240 : If only there were another, more reliable method...
8241 : And what do we have here!?
8242 : Toadprints! And quite fresh, by my calculations.
8243 : Salwa, my boy. Have you seen any other toads in the vicinity since arriving?
8244 : I-- No... I haven't!
8245 : Then by process of elimination, we can deduce that the prints here belong to none other than Mikilulu!
8246 : Whoa! I guess that's why they call you Professor!
8247 : But... This place is huge. Where do we start looking?
8248 : You need not worry, son. Poroggo are an amphibious species, meaning they cannot survive long out of water.
8249 : To the west of our current location lies a small lake that is rumored to be one of their breeding grounds. We shall first try our luck there.
8250 : And if anything attempts to attack us, I am sure our trusty mercenary here will handle it.
8251 : Another toadprint!
8252 : And exactly the same shape as the last! I feel we are getting close...
8253 : And here is another!
8254 : But this one is considerably larger... No doubt from the Poroggo that abducted the poor Mikilulu. This suggests that they are still traveling together.
8255 : I found her!!!
8256 : I do not see any Poroggo in the area. Hurry! We must capture her while she is alone!
8257 : Let me make sure her print is the same as the one at the entrance.
8258 : Yes... A perfect match!
8259 : Yes!
8260 : Mikimiki! Why did you go and run away from your Salwa? You don't know how worried I was!
8261 : So, Professor. Now all we have to do is wait for the spell to wear off naturally, right?
8262 : Correct. Though, I highly recommend we do so at a location safer than this.
8263 : Look out!
8264 : Ugh!
8265 : Hmmm... Just as I had feared.
8266 : Wait! Come back here, you stinky, slimy frogman!
8267 : Stop!
8268 : Gwahhh!
8269 : I--I don't think I can handle this guy by myself... He's all yours, %!
8270 : Save my Mikilulu!
8271 : You did it! Now Miki will...
8272 : What the...?
8273 : I do not understand... The spell should have been broken the instant the caster became incapacitated.
8274 : Does this mean...we killed the wrong one!?
8275 : Hmmm... The print is the same as the one we saw near Mikilulu's.
8276 : I also believe I witnessed your lady friend respond to one of the Poroggo's commands during the battle.
8277 : Finally, you can see that the subject has calmed down quite considerably since her captor's defeat.
8278 : Then if this is really Miki, and that is really the culprit, then why is she still a toad!?
8279 : That, my boy, I cannot say. My data has never failed me before...
8280 : But... But...
8281 : But what about waiting for the spell to wear off? You said that would work, right?
8282 : Yes, and I also said that slaying the caster would break the curse...
8283 : Eh!?
8284 : Let us rethink this from a scientific standpoint, shall we?
8285 : First of all, it is clear that the tissue mutation is merely a physiological reaction to a particular medium that has been introduced into the victim's body via the sound waves of the frog song.
8286 : This reaction continues until the whole body is affected, thus reducing him or her to the shape of the assailant.
8287 : The concept is much similar to that behind the strange liquid medium that transforms its consumer into the shape of a Mamool Ja.
8288 : Now, whether the sound waves of the frog song actually carry the medium...
8289 : ...or simply act as a catalyst, activating a genetic medium already present in the victim's body, I cannot say.
8290 : That was to be the focal point of this expedition's research.
8291 : As for the victim's actions while in the transmogrified state, it seems that one loses the ability of voluntary thought, leaving him susceptible to the will of the caster.
8292 : We can derive from this that the Poroggo must be sending some type of neural signal directly to the victim's brain.
8293 : I believe this signal may also affect the medium I spoke of earlier.
8294 : By taking control of the nervous system, the Poroggo is able to override the victim's natural defenses--in particular, the defenses that prevent foreign mediums from invading the body.
8295 : The signal also may trigger the spontaneous generation of a new medium in the body by stimulating certain areas of the cerebral cortex.
8296 : To put it in layman's terms...
8297 : To maintain the transmogrified state, there must exist a continuous physiological reaction.
8298 : In other words, the Poroggo must keep sending inhibitor signals to the victim, or the reaction will cease.
8299 : In theory, maintaining these signals would require extreme levels of concentration. This explains why most victims return to their original state after extended periods of time--when the caster becomes fatigued or distracted.
8300 : And if we apply these same conclusions, then we can easily explain why defeating the caster would immediately nullify the effects of the song.
8301 : However, as we can see here, the victim, Mikilulu, remains in the transmogrified state despite the fact her assailant has met his demise.
8302 : Which suggests that she may not return with the simple passing of time.
8303 : Wh-what!? That can't be!
8304 : The potency of the physiological reaction has been known to vary depending on mental condition of the victim. It is possible the song resonated with something deep within Mikilulu's subconscious.
8305 : Wait a minute... Are you trying to say that my girl has always been a frog!?
8306 : While I wouldn't necessarily use those words, yes, one could say that your Mikilulu has more than likely been harboring suppressed ranine tendencies.
8307 : Though, there may be a more reasonable explanation.
8308 : For example, if a large portion of Mikilulu's conscious had been dedicated to thinking of, and or, worrying about toads, then her mind may have become dependant on the Poroggo's signal and thus began reproducing it out of necessity when the original signal stopped.
8309 : Eh!?
8310 : In any case, finding a cure will require months, maybe years of new research.
8311 : I am sorry, Salwa, but you shall just have to wait until then to reunite with your lady friend.
8312 : ...
8313 : But you need not fear, my friend, for I shall dedicate myself to finding a solution to this predicament.
8314 : You have my word as a scientist!
8315 : P-Professor! Let me help you!
8316 : I'll do anything! I mean, I don't know much about zoology, but there's got to be something I can do!
8317 : Hmmm... I conduct a very strict program. I require the utmost in discipline from my assistants.
8318 : Discipline is my middle name! I won't let you down!
8319 : But can I trust you...?
8320 : Alright. You may temporarily join my research team.
8321 : T-Thanks B! I...uh, mean, thank you very much, Your Professing Greatness.
8322 : Now we must hurry back to Al Zahbi and begin conducting tests. Move along, young man! We have little time to waste!
8323 : Ah, and if I do recall, you have a slight problem with punctuality.
8324 : That is why I will require you to take up residency in my laboratory's supplies room. Do you have any objections?
8325 : N-none at all, sir!
8326 : Alright, Miki. Let's go back to the kind professor's lab, where I'll build you a nice, big cage with grass and rocks and...
8327 : Oh, and I bet you'll be wanting to take a swim every now and then.
8328 : Well, you don't have to worry about that. Just croak and I'll dig you your very own swamp, with lily pads and everything!
8329 : And food! I'll get you whatever you're craving for! What are you craving for? Worms? No, wait moles like worms... What do toads like again? Bugs! That's right!
8330 : If it's bugs you want, bugs you'll get! I've got a Mog Locker full of shell bugs from that last time I tried to grow some ore.
8331 : ...
8332 : That's right, Miki. I'll be right by your side until the big B can find a way to turn you back to normal.
8333 : And then...
8334 : We can get married and live happily ever after!
8335 : M-Mikilulu!
8336 : Amazing!
8337 : That's all I wanted to hear, Salwa.
8338 : You... You understood what I was saying the whole time?
8339 : No, not the whole time.
8340 : But for some reason, those last few words of yours rang out in my head...
8341 : ...and before I knew it, I was back to my old self!
8342 : Wow... So, all this time you were a frog, you were still thinking of me?
8343 : I'm sorry, Mikilulu. This is all my fault. If I hadn't made you worry about me being transmutrified into a toad, you wouldn't have had to go through all this.
8344 : But never again! From now on, I'll protect you from anything that stands in the way of our love...
8345 : Salwa...
8346 : ...as soon as I finish this job for Professor Clavauert!
8347 : Your services are no longer required, Salwa-Molwa.
8348 : Eh? You're not going through with the experiment? But what about your research? What about my paycheck!?
8349 : What are you talking about? The experiment was a success.
8350 : Let me sum up my theory for you.
8351 : Your expression of love triggered something within Mikilulu's mind, or should I say heart, thus releasing her from the grasp of the inhibitor signals.
8352 : This ultimately proves that the duration of the frog song depends less on the potency of the Poroggo's cant, and more on the victim's psychological state.
8353 : And because we now know that the victim's mind is capable of mimicking the Poroggo inhibitor signal...
8354 : ...we can conclude that the song is merely a catalyst, and it is the victim himself that maintains the actual transmogrification.
8355 : However, we cannot ignore previous data showing symptoms of the toad curse vanishing upon the death of the caster.
8356 : Therefore, I shall reconstruct my original theories and continue my research to discover a connection between Poroggo neural activity and transmogrification duration.
8357 : This expedition has spawned more questions than it has answered, but I did learn one thing...
8358 : ...that the true culprit behind physical transmogrification is the victim himself!
8359 : If this seemingly subconscious action could somehow be made lucid, then people could transform themselves into whatever shape they dreamed!
8360 : However, this hypothesis requires much more research before it can be proven. I have much work ahead of me...
8361 : And... Um... So does this mean I still get my paycheck...?
8362 : <Sigh> Of course it does. And I shall even throw in something extra for Mikilulu's part in all this. Come by my office tomorrow morning at nine o-clock sharp...and do not be late!
8363 : Th-thank you!
8364 : Ah yes, and I suppose you'll be wanting your reward as well. I have entrusted your payment with Maudaal in Whitegate. Speak with him when you return to the city.
8365 : Now let us be off!
8366 : I had my doubts, but I must say, Maudaal, you are a fine judge of character.
8367 : This mercenary performed exceptionally on our expedition. I thank you once again.
8368 : I shall speak personally with your captain and inform her of your accomplishments.
8369 : Thank you, Professor. That is not necessary.
8370 : And now, for your paycheck.
8371 : You have earned it, my little friend.
8372 : Alright!
8373 : See, Miki! I scored us all this gil!
8374 : You earned us all that gil? Who's the one that was turned into a toad!? That purse of coins should have my name on it!
8375 : Wait a minute, you've got this all wrong.
8376 : If it wasn't for me mustering up the bravery to go on the mission in the first place, you wouldn't have followed me into the forest at all!
8377 : That's right! It's ALL your fault that I was transformed!
8378 : Hmph! You haven't changed a bit!
8379 : B-But... I... I... I'm sorry, Miki...
8380 : Calm down, Salwa.
8381 : While I am a scientist, I cannot help but believe that fate played a role in all this.
8382 : Out of passion for my research, I called upon two companions to accompany me to Mamook.
8383 : Out of love for his soon-to-be better half, Salwa-Molwa chose to embark on this dangerous mission...
8384 : ...as did %, whose endless yearnings for adventure brought [him/her] to my side.
8385 : And finally, you--it was your feelings for Salwa-Molwa that drove you to follow us.
8386 : It was not until after misfortune had befallen Mikilulu that Salwa-Molwa realized how much he truly cared about her.
8387 : And it was not until this realization of Salwa's that Mikilulu truly understood what lies deep within his heart.
8388 : And! If it were not for this quaint melodrama, I would still be years behind in my research of the Poroggo, and % would probably still be out collecting bat wings.
8389 : Yes, fate has led us to our proper destinations! (Though, if I had not hired you two in the first place...)
8390 : Ahem! Still, I still cannot comprehend what the Poroggo was thinking when it cast that terrible curse on poor Mikilulu.
8391 : That's easy, Professor! It was love at first sight!
8392 : It's the only explanation!
8393 : You see, even without Miki's toadprints, I was positive I could tell her apart from the other frogs.
8394 : Why? Because the most beautiful Tarutaru in the world would have to be the most beautiful toad in the world. And only a toad that beautiful would be worthy enough to play the part of Princess Poroggo!
8395 : Princess Poroggo!? You've got to be kidding!
8396 : While everything did not quite proceed as planned, I must say, this was one of my more entertaining expeditions.
8397 : I wish the both of you happiness and good fortune...
8398 : ...even if it means losing one of my best guinea toads. Aha hah hah!
8399 : Guinea toad! Hahahahaha! That was a good one, B!
8400 : Manners, Salwa!
8401 : Speaking of good ones, did you know that he thinks you might actually be more toad than Taru? Bwahahahaha!
8402 : What are you laughing at!? Do I look like I enjoy eating bugs!?
8403 : And so, I guess this is adios!
8404 : Salwa the Unworthy has finally proven his worth.
8405 : And now I can spend my time protecting the girl I love!
8406 : And so as of today, I hang up my sword and shield to devote myself to my new family...
8407 : ...Good luck, my friends......your endeavors......
8408 : ......ake care...and......grib...
8409 : Rgib...
8410 : ...bri...
8411 : Ribbit!?
8412 : (((Anyway, I tried my best to catch my poor sweetheart, but she was just too slick and slimy.)))
8413 : (((And before I knew it, I found myself in the middle of the forest. Miki had stopped near a tree and I was just about to sneak up and grab her...)))
8414 : (((...when I saw her jump towards a shadow that was probably a terrible monster! It was a Poroggo, I tell you!)))
8415 : (((And I'd bet my grandma's subligar that it was the same one that put us to sleep!)))
8416 : (((...the true culprit behind physical transmogrification is the victim himself!)))
8417 : (((If this seemingly subconscious action could somehow be made lucid, then people could transform themselves into whatever shape they dreamed!)))
8418 : (((Still, I still cannot comprehend what that Poroggo was thinking when it cast that terrible curse on poor Mikilulu.)))
8419 : (((That's easy, Professor! It was love at first sight!)))
8420 : (((Why? Because the most beautiful Tarutaru in the world would have to be the most beautiful toad in the world.)))
8421 : (((And only a toad that beautiful would be worthy enough to play the part of Princess Poroggo!)))
8422 : (((Huh!?)))
8423 : (((How is practicing to be a frog going to help you return to normal!?)))
8424 : (((That's all I wanted to hear, Salwa.)))
8425 : Goodbye, Professor! Goodbye, %!
8426 : Farewell, my little friend.
8427 : %... You seem troubled.
8428 : Is there anything you wish to say? The Poroggo didn't do anything! The true culprit is Mikilulu! The girl was a toad all along! She's evil, I tell you! We have to warn Salwa-Molwa! You should be researching her!
8429 : Aha hah hah! You have a keen sense of perception, %.
8430 : I, too, had considered that possibility.
8431 : However, I lack the evidence required to construct a proper theory.
8432 : So, why not conduct tests on Mikilulu right away?
8433 : Listen carefully, %. In the world of science, just because new light is shed upon a dark room of questions does not necessarily mean that light will lead you to the answers you seek.
8434 : Especially when there are still many more lights remaining to examine before racing off blindly after a single one.
8435 : I will continue to collect my small truths and piece them together until I can complete the final picture. Whether this takes months or even years, there is no need to rush science. She will show me what I seek when she deems it the right time to do so.
8436 : And, who am I to disturb a loving couple the moment they find their happiness?
8437 : Leave them be, %.
8438 : Nevertheless, these events prove that the truth is often stranger than fiction, wouldn't you say?
8439 : Pleasantries aside, the whole thing closely resembles the tale of Poroggo and the Prince. Why, the two are even planning a marriage, it seems.
8440 : I believe I mentioned earlier that a good scientist does not mix science and fairy tales.
8441 : Though I have learned much in the past few days, there is still little information on the Poroggo.
8442 : After some of the amazing things we witnessed, it would be easy to attempt to tie those to superstition.
8443 : However, this would only lead us farther from the truth.
8444 : Ridding our mind of prejudice and predetermination, and approaching a problem with a clean slate is the only way to find what we seek.
8445 : I believe this can be said for adventurers as well as scientists.
8446 : %, it has been a pleasure working with you, and I hope that our paths cross again in the future.
8447 : Ah, yes. And before I forget...
8448 : Here is your reward.
8449 : I hope it aids you on your travels.
8450 : Farewell!
8451 : Please wait a few moments and try inspecting the area again.
8452 : Incredible. You were able to shoot down that airship from an amazing distance moments after we had detected it...
8453 : To be honest, I hadn't even made visual contact. A dot appeared on the control panel display...
8454 : I merely moved the targeting reticule over the dot and pulled the trigger.
8455 : Amazing... I put this device together with my own hands but there are still so many functions I have yet to understand. It's actually a little embarrassing.
8456 : Do not let it concern you, Ghatsad. Most importantly, we have confirmed that the colossus will follow my commands. Did you witness that power!?
8457 : We have realized the thousand-year ambition of our ancestors and once again harnessed the divine might of Alexander.
8458 : Yes, Grand Vizier. All of Urhguum will bow to the authority of the Empire.
8459 : Our nation will finally have the undisputed peace it deserves...
8460 : Your pardon, Grand Vizier. I come with word of the Empress...
8461 : Speak.
8462 : Sir. Lady Nashmeira has fled the palace.
8463 : As per your orders, we did nothing to stop her...
8464 : Hmph, so her apparent docility was nothing more than an act. Her destination?
8465 : We...we lost her...
8466 : Ahahahaha. She managed to elude the Immortals? Impressive!
8467 : My most abject apologies, Grand Vizier. We have soldiers combing every ilm of the capital. We will find her.
8468 : Let her go.
8469 : But, sir...
8470 : Nashmeira has lost the absolute authority of her position as well as her two closest companions in the space of a week--her emotional strength will be sorely tested.
8471 : If she cannot overcome this trial, I fear she will not be fit to serve the Empire in any case.
8472 : Sir...
8473 : There are more important matters that demand our attention. We must first focus our efforts on rooting out the rebellious elements within our own walls.
8474 : Raubahn. What is the situation with Luzaf?
8475 : Sir. He is being transferred to the facility in question, as you ordered.
8476 : Good. Once he has been...dealt with...I will make a proclamation to the people.
8477 : Then, the time has come...
8478 : Yes. We shall unleash Alexander to defeat the Dark Rider, and then proceed to overpower our rival nations.
8479 : I assume there are no objections to this plan?
8480 : There is one small detail concerning the transfer of the prisoner, Luzaf...
8481 : Explain.
8482 : %...
8483 : Hey! %! Are you okay!?
8484 : [He/ShE] LivES! I wAS aBouTto bRiNg oUTtHE rePAiR kiT!
8485 : You were a bit banged up, but nothing serious, it seems. Jumping over the side was the right decision. The ones that stayed on the ship weren't so lucky...
8486 : I'll check the wreck for survivors.
8487 : You and the King should continue with the mission. After what happened here, I don't think we have any time to lose.
8488 : Leave the wounded to me--Musketeer training includes a thorough course in first aid.
8489 : Ah, I almost forgot.
8490 : You better take this device, King. Give my best to Rohin-Codimin!
8491 : TeAM LeAdErNaJi...
8492 : OuR coNTacT'snaME is RoDiN-CoMidiN...
8493 : AnD tHistoY iS bRokEN.

8495 : ComE, PRoViSionALJaCk! We mAKehaSTe fOR ALZaHBi!
8496 : You sense an ominous presence...
8497 : The heady fragrance of wine pervades the air...
8498 : Minute glittering fragments are scattered all over...
8499 : Broken shards of insect wing are scattered all over...
8500 : The ground is strewn with shed leaves...
8501 : Piles of pamama peels litter the ground...
8502 : The ground is smeared with bloodstains...
8503 : Numerous strands of hair are scattered all over...
8504 : Broken shards of insect wing are scattered all over...
8505 : A sickly sweet fragrance pervades the air...
8506 : An acidic odor pervades the air...
8507 : A putrid odor threatens to overwhelm you...
8508 : The ground is smeared with bloodstains...
8509 : An acidic odor pervades the air...
8510 : A sickly sweet fragrance pervades the air...
8511 : A stifling stench pervades the air...
8512 : The ground is carpeted in a thin layer of cinder.
8513 : A sickly sweet fragrance pervades the air...
8514 : The ground is strewn with shed leaves...
8515 : A sickly sweet fragrance pervades the air...
8516 : The ground here is slimy to the touch...
8517 : A stifling stench pervades the air...
8518 : Shredded scraps of paper are scattered all over...
8519 : The ground is strewn with shed leaves...
8520 : A stifling stench pervades the air...
8521 : Minute glittering fragments are scattered all over...
8522 : Light, fluttery objects litter the ground...
8523 : A sickly sweet fragrance pervades the air...
8524 : Minute glittering fragments are scattered all over...
8525 : The ground here is slimy to the touch...
8526 : The ground is smeared with bloodstains...
8527 : Something draws near!
8529 : You found something!?
8530 : Yes...that ribbon... I have often seen the general gazing contentedly at that strip of cloth.
8531 : Thank you. This must be the item he dropped.
8532 : Did I not tell you? You could expect nothing less from an attendant to Fari-Wari the Eloquent!
8533 : So it seems. I believe I owe you a tale, then.
8534 : It was the events of a single night that would change General Rughadjeen's fate forever...
8535 : Almost two years ago now, the western arm of the Imperial Army was under the sole command of General Missahd, a member of the royal family.
8536 : Assigned to this general was one Captain Rughadjeen...
8537 : Hmph. I see. I will pass your proposal on to the Operations Staff for due consideration.
8538 : There is no time for that! There are signs that the beastmen are massing for a full-scale assault! We cannot wait for reinforcements!
8539 : <Sigh>... Captain, have you seen the fortifications on the Balrahn Defense Line? And the number of our soldiers that man those walls?
8540 : Our enemies are nothing more than mindless beasts that will break themselves against our stalwart defenses. It matters not how many pigs come to the slaughter.
8541 : ...
8542 : At the very least...
8543 : Will you allow me to lead a heavy infantry unit in a surprise attack on the enemy stronghold?
8544 : ...
8545 : We will approach under the cover of darkness this very night and blunt their desire for battle.
8546 : We will break the spine of this newly formed army before it even begins to move.
8547 : If all goes well, we will sow chaos among their disorderly ranks, and buy time to bolster our defenses.
8548 : Captain Rughadjeen...
8549 : The beastmen forces are focused and eager for blood.
8550 : If we allow them to reach the capital with an organized army, they will break through any holes in the line and rain destruction on the lightly defended city streets...
8551 : Rughadjeen!
8552 : ...Sir.
8553 : You speak above your station. I don't have time to listen to a lowly captain with delusions of strategic brilliance.
8554 : ...
8555 : I will not stand for this disrespectful attitude. From this day forth, you are relieved from the position of captain.
8556 : Wha--!?
8557 : After receiving the punishment of ten lashes for disrespecting a senior officer, you are to return to your unit and follow the orders of the newly appointed captain.
8558 : ...Sir.
8559 : Hmph. A simple captain attempting to lecture me on strategy...
8560 : An attack?
8561 : Where are they!?
8562 : The West Gate!
8563 : What befalls!?
8564 : Captain Rughadjeen! It's absolute chaos!
8565 : The Balrahn Defense Line has been breached...
8566 : And the capital is surrounded by an army of Troll Mercenaries!
8567 : Surrounded!?
8568 : The savages have brought siege weapons. It won't be long before the streets are swarming with them...
8569 : What of the soldiers along the defense line? An army of that size could not have been swept aside so easily.
8570 : The defense forces are engaged with a horde of Mamool Ja that arrived on the heels of the Trolls.
8571 : Then we are too late...
8572 : The beastmen have outmaneuvered us...
8573 : Our unit is forming up as we speak.
8574 : What are your orders, Captain?
8575 : Forgive me...
8576 : Captain?
8577 : General Missahd just relieved me of my post. I have no authority...
8578 : Isn't that the general over there...?
8579 : !?
8580 : Why is he running that way? The front line is... Surely he doesn't intend to abandon the citizens to their fate?
8581 : I shall assume temporary command of our forces.
8582 : Sir!
8583 : Ready arms! Form ranks!
8584 : This will be a bloodbath...
8585 : Hold ranks!
8586 : The enemy is just as exhausted as you.
8587 : If we can hold but a few moments more, they will break. This battle is ours!
8588 : Let them tire themselves destroying our buildings--it will help prevent the spread of fires.
8589 : Your main objective is the safety of our citizens. The future of this city rests on your shoulders!
8590 : For Al Zahbi!
8591 : !?
8592 : You! You can't go that way!
8593 : You'll get yourself killed!
8594 : ...
8595 : Sajalda, take command of the troops.
8596 : Sir!
8597 : Aphmau... It's worse than we heard. Look!
8598 : She didn't get out in time...
8599 : Ovjang?
8600 : Okay.
8601 : Follow me!
8602 : Hey! Stay where you are!
8603 : You can't...!
8604 : !!!
8605 : Dammit!
8606 : You!
8607 : ...
8608 : Where's the girl?
8609 : ...
8610 : Please wake up...
8611 : Ngh...
8612 : She'll be fine. Just a bump to the head.
8613 : Ngh... <Cough...cough>.
8614 : You're safe now. Can you sit up?
8615 : She is...unharmed...?
8616 : I'm so glad...
8617 : You...rescued us?
8618 : Yes.
8619 : Our thanks...
8620 : Reckless child. You could've been killed!
8621 : But I commend you on your bravery...
8622 : Please... You must go now...
8623 : What?
8624 : We'll be fine... You must return...
8625 : There are still many...who need your help...
8626 : So go...and help them...
8627 : I can't just leave two children--
8628 : Lady Aphmau!
8629 : Thank Walahra! Are you injured!?
8630 : I'm fine.
8631 : Well, that's good to...
8632 : No, this is terrible! What if something happened to you!? You must be more careful!
8633 : I am sorry...
8634 : (You worry too much, Rishfee.)
8635 : Lady Aphmau, who is that person?
8636 : He risked his own life to...
8637 : Wait!
8638 : Your arm... You're bleeding!
8639 : This scratch? It's nothing.
8640 : It looks bad. You shouldn't ignore your injuries!
8641 : Here...
8642 : Thank you...
8643 : Would...would you tell me your name?
8644 : I am Rughadjeen. ...A soldier in the Imperial Army.
8645 : Rughadjeen then returned to the front line, gathering the scattered soldiers to him as he leaped into the fray...
8646 : The Troll and Mamool Ja armies were beaten back by the invigorated defense, and the capital was saved from destruction.
8647 : The words of that young lady had instilled him with heroic valor!
8648 : It may be as you say.
8649 : And then? I assume the valiant Rughadjeen was handsomely rewarded for his deeds?
8650 : Despite the desperate circumstances, Rughadjeen's actions overstepped the bounds of his authority. The military is unforgiving when it comes to such transgressions.
8651 : Unbelievable! Surely that nasty General Missahd interfered in the proceedings!?
8652 : Who can say? The result was that Rughadjeen was confined to the barracks--a punishment he accepted without a single word of protest.
8653 : How tragic! Are the fates so cruel!?
8654 : Then one day, a messenger arrived with a summons to the Imperial Palace.
8655 : Huzzah!
8656 : He was to have an audience with Her Magnificence?
8657 : Wh-what became of Rughadjeen!?
8658 : Well, you see...ah. My break time is over. I must return to my post.
8659 : Nooo!
8660 : I'm sorry, but we must continue this another time.
8661 : Until then.
8662 : Biyaada! How can you torture me so!? Ah...
8663 : Oh, woe is me! Oh, gloom and misery!
8664 : Oh, hullo there. If it isn't my erstwhile attendant. Well met...
8665 : Come to have a jest, have you?  To jape and jeer at Fari-Wari the Pitiful?
8666 : Once the acclaimed balladeer of the Serpent Generals five--or was it four?  Bah, 'tis no matter.
8667 : A minstrel of such repute that other bards would sing my praises! My adoring fans lined up on every corner to catch a passing strain of my latest magnum opus!
8668 : What's the matter, you say!? See for yourself!
8669 : Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery? Hogwash, I say!
8670 : Those hacks, those poseurs! They pilfer my melodies and claim them as their own! And do you know the worst of it, my dear attendant?
8671 : The uncultured hoi polloi--they pay no heed to this artistic travesty! They suck up this swill like so many swine!
8672 : <Ahem> Pardon me...
8673 : Oh, woe! Is there no one in this boorish world who can appreciate true genius!? Is this how the ballad of Fari-Wari is destined to close? A melancholy coda to a once-glorious career? The tragedy! The horror!
8674 : Ah, so you're Fari-Wari. Your reputation for bombast precedes you.
8675 : That would make you %, correct?
8676 : Yes, yes...my hapless attendant. Should you have business with us, please direct your inquiries to the management--namely, me.
8677 : I see. As a matter of fact, I was hoping to obtain your counsel--
8678 : Denied!
8679 : If you could not discern from my dapper attire and most mellifluous voice, I am a bard, you see? I have neither the time nor the inclination to entertain the trifling sob stories of every wastrel in town. If an ear for your bellyaching is all you seek, I suggest you order yourself a chai and chat up the proprietor of this establishment!
8680 : As you wish, Master Fari-Wari. I shall find another ear for the matter of General Gadalar.
8681 : Yes yes, away with you--ah. Begging your pardon, my good man, but did you say General Gadalar?  You speak of the Flameserpent General?
8682 : The very same. As you might know, General Gadalar is...how shall I put it? A tad...impulsive? Volatile, if you will?
8683 : No explanation needed, my friend! I'm still smoldering from the time he unleashed a Firaga spell on my delicate derriere...the rogue!
8684 : Oh my, that does sound most harrowing. Now, if I may continue... Needless to say, the Flameserpent General's...contentious...behavior has not gone unnoticed by high command.
8685 : To this point, his undeniable prowess in battle and the personal good graces of the Skyserpent General have shielded him from being seriously punished for his indiscretions.
8686 : This time, however, the powers that be have lost their patience and decided to court-martial him for his actions! I fear that there may be no saving him.
8687 : How terribly unfortunate. Couldn't have happened to a nicer chap, I say!
8688 : 'Tis true that General Gadalar's prickly demeanor has not endeared him to his superiors. Even in the halls of the Imperial Court, few are willing to step forward in his defense.
8689 : His fellow Serpent Generals are exerting their best efforts on his behalf, but...
8690 : To no avail?
8691 : Sadly, no. And General Gadalar's refusal to exercise even a modicum of self-restraint has served only to fan the flames.
8692 : On the contrary, the latest rumors have it that he has taken to slipping outside the city walls under the veil of night. On what furtive errand, no one knows.
8693 : Outside town? How curious indeed...  Oho! Mayhap he's merely partaking in a tryst or two with his latest inamorata?
8694 : Preposterous! The Flameserpent General is not one for idle romance.
8695 : On another subject, have you perchance heard the news of The Crow of the East?
8696 : Crow? I thought we were discussing the General Gadalar, not some vile bird. Though if we must speak of eastern fowl, they say there's one called a pheasant that tastes most delectable in a fine currant sauce.
8697 : I speak not of birds, but rather birdmen. Beastmen of the Far East.
8698 : Have you not heard the whispers? Members of the night watch have come under attack from an unidentified foe...
8699 : The details remain closely guarded, but witnesses have stated that the culprit bears an uncanny resemblance to a birdman of the east.
8700 : Birdman? Ah, a Yagudo!
8701 : And since General Gadalar spent so many years stationed in the Far East, they suspect him of being in league with this fiend?
8702 : Sadly, yes.
8703 : Now, 'tis true that the Flameserpent General's cavalier demeanor might lead some to believe he is not as responsible as his peers.
8704 : Yet, as his adjutant, I swear to you on my life. The general's love of nation and sense of duty are second to no man.
8705 : The idea that he would strike down a comrade in cold blood is inconceivable!
8706 : Oho...
8707 : So I turn to the two of you.  I have heard that you are trusted by the Serpent Generals. Surely you could approach General Gadalar without arousing undue suspicion.
8708 : Friends of the Empire, I beseech you. Find proof of the general's innocence before the court-martial commences and our worst fears are realized.
8709 : No small task...
8710 : ...but we accept! Let it never be said that Fari-Wari the Courageous and his plucky attendant would turn a blind eye to one in need!
8711 : Truly, you'll help? I cannot thank you enough!
8712 : The general's been observed heading in the direction of Mount Zhayolm.
8713 : Ah, yes...Mount Zhayolm. Quite a trek from here, and crawling with all manner of unpleasant Trolls...
8714 : This sounds like just the task for...my loyal attendant!
8715 : Oh ho, but I jest! Thought you'd be left to fend for yourself while Fari-Wari sits around sipping chai, did you?
8716 : Not this time, my friend! After all, no enterprising bard could pass up a prime chance to get some dirt on-- ...er, that is, to earn the favor of the incomparable General Gadalar.
8717 : And, in the process, exact my revenge for-- ...ahem, rather, acquire some prime material for my next lyrical masterpiece. Heh heh heh...
8718 : I see...  In any event, the Flameserpent General's fate is in your hands. Pray report back to me as soon as your investigation bears fruit.
8719 : Say no more!
8720 : With Fari-Wari on the job, the deed is as good as done. You heard the good man, %. We're off to Mount Zhayolm!
8721 : We'll rendezvous at the path leading to Halvung. Last one there is a rotten puk egg!
8722 : Ah, %...took you long enough. I was beginning to worry that you'd fallen into a crater.
8723 : I've been waiting here for Shayadar, but it would appear that our friend is a busy man.
8724 : Oh, you're here! Thank the heavens!
8725 : Ah, Shayadar. We've been waiting so long we were starting to grow moss. You seem flustered. Whatever is the matter?
8726 : Friends, I bring grave news. The officer in charge of Gadalar's court-martial, one General Malzaab, has lost his patience. He's ordered for the committee to convene ahead of schedule!
8727 : General Rughadjeen, you and I are both busy men. How much longer does he intend to keep us waiting?
8728 : I assure you, General Najelith has been sent to escort him here as we speak. Pray abide for just a moment longer, sir.
8729 : This is preposterous. The man cannot find his way to our chambers without a Serpent General as his personal chaperone? Perhaps he avoids us because he has something to hide, hm?
8730 : Never! General Gadalar may be hotheaded, yes, but surely you know as well as I that he is among our most exemplary warriors!
8731 : It is not his martial abilities that we doubt, General Rughadjeen. His brilliant exploits on the Far Eastern front have not been forgotten. On the contrary, it is because we hold him in such high regard that we negotiated for him to be first among the hostages freed from captivity.
8732 : Still, no amount of success in battle places one above the law. All the more so for a general of the Imperial Army.
8733 : ...
8734 : Since your friend clearly has no respect for our time, let us use it productively. Solicitor, if you will.
8735 : Yes, sir. Oyez, oyez, oyez! The charges against the Flameserpent General are as follows...
8736 : Firstly, striking the defenseless General Anizahm with an armored fist during a verbal dispute at last month's war council. The blow broke multiple teeth and put the general out of commission for nigh a month.
8737 : ...
8738 : Next!
8739 : Furthermore, indiscriminate brandishing of his scythe and wielding of destructive magic during a quarrel with mercenaries at a public teahouse. These actions caused over 400 Imperial gold pieces worth of property damages, not to mention needlessly endangering the lives of innocent bystanders.
8740 : ...
8741 : Yes, sir.  <Ahem>...
8742 : Lastly is the matter at the core of these proceedings. We have strong reason to suspect that General Gadalar, with his connections to the Far East, is working in league with the Yagudo spies that have been sighted within the city. Eyewitness reports place--
8743 : We have reason to suspect that an officer with close ties to the East is working in league with this foul beastman. Clearly, this points to the Flameserp--
8744 : Preposterous! General Gadalar would never...!
8746 : Grievous news! Ah...
8747 : Pray excuse us for a moment.
8748 : What's going on? Where is Gadalar!?
8749 : General Rughadjeen, I was prepared to bring him here bound hand and foot if necessary. But I've searched his quarters--he's nowhere to be found!
8750 : No doubt he's taken umbrage at the very notion of these proceedings...
8751 : But whatever shall we do? If he angers the committee, he could lose his position...!
8752 : ...Or his head.
8753 : My deepest apologies. It appears that General Gadalar is abed with a fever most foul, and will be unable to present himself today.
8754 : Bwahahaha! Does he take us for fools? The mighty Flameserpent General bedridden with a mere fever?
8755 : I ask you, put off the proceedings for another day. Next time, I swear on my honor, I will bring Gadalar here myself.
8756 : As you wish. Far be it from me to deny a heartfelt plea from the Skyserpent General. Next time, though, there will be no excuses.
8757 : Surely you see the urgency of the situation. We must find General Gadalar at all costs.
8758 : Of course, even if found, 'tis unlikely he'll go willingly. Alas! Is there nothing that can be done? <Sigh>...
8759 : Shayadar, my good man.  Pardon for interrupting your brooding, but as a matter of fact, my attendant and I...
8760 : What's this you say? General Gadalar assaulted you at Mount Zhayolm? Surely...surely the accusations aren't--
8761 : No, they cannot--they must not--be true! General Gadalar would never...
8763 : ...Wait.
8764 : You witnessed the Flameserpent General's actions for only a decidedly short period of time, correct?
8765 : Well, yes. We did lose sight of him halfway through--
8766 : Could it be that you were set up as a witness?
8767 : Wh-what!?
8768 : If that was truly all General Gadalar's doing, it is almost as if he wanted to be seen. But for what purpose...?
8770 : Indeed. If only we had some other clue...
8771 : Oh, how could I forget!? We found this at the scene.  Perhaps this sheds some light on the Flameserpent General's actions?
8772 : Is this...%?
8773 : It's a rare and highly valuable flower that grows only in the Far East...or so I've heard.
8774 : Why would General Gadalar carelessly toss aside such a precious blossom? Perhaps it is a signal of sorts? Some cryptic message, known only to those of the East?
8775 : I'm afraid that without more evidence, 'tis naught but idle speculation. I beseech you, friends. Will you return to Mount Zhayolm and hunt down the truth?
8776 : But of course, my good man!  Fari-Wari the Fastidious is not one to leave a job half-done!
8778 : My attendant would be honored to comply!
8779 : (After all, I can't neglect my compositional pursuits for too long. If my latest masterpiece were delayed, my fans all over the Empire--nay, the world--will be rioting in the streets! Surely you understand.)
8780 : (Here's the %... Happy hunting!)
8782 : % was returned to you.
8783 : Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.
8784 : Those who possess % may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused. Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.
8785 : Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
8786 : I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
8787 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Have stratum abyssite examined. Request teleportation. Analyze atmacite. Ask about atmacite. Ask about atmacite enrichment.
8788 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.
8789 : Infuse which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) Previous page. Next page.
8790 : Infusing the % (lv.#) requires # cruor.
8791 : Infuse % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
8792 : You do not have enough cruor.
8793 : [Infuse/Purge] which atmacite? None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#)
8794 : Purge % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
8795 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with % (lv.#)!
8796 : The atmacite could not be infused...
8797 : % has been purged of the % (lv.#).
8798 : % purges the % (lv.#), infusing % (lv.#) in its place. (Cruor expended: #)
8799 : You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.
8800 : Enrich which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # Previous page. Next page.
8801 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
8802 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
8803 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
8804 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
8805 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
8806 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
8807 : The atmacite could not be purged...
8808 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
8809 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
8810 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
8811 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
8812 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
8813 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
8814 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
8815 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
8816 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
8817 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
8818 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
8819 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
8820 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
8821 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
8822 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
8823 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
8824 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
8825 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
8826 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
8827 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
8828 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
8829 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
8830 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
8831 : Your % has evolved into %!
8832 : Supply me with the # cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.

9567 : Well as I live an' breathe! An adventurer! Now I got some reeeal work t' be done, but yew'll need some meat on yer bones afore I let yew near it.
9568 : Well hi there, sugar! I do declare, those [bulging muscles/taut thighs] of yers look like they're [about to pop right out of yer armor/ready to choke a bear]. We could use a [guy/gal] like yew in the Voidwatch.
9569 : In case yew weren't aware, hon, Jeuno's put together a group called the Voidwatch, whose brave men an' women fight the good fight in this here war of Voidwalker aggression.
9570 : ...An' the fact we're here a-courtin' adventurers like yew says a barrelful about the Empire's predicament. Those trainer drips or whatchamacallsem are swarmin' these lands like flies on a dead chocobo, I tell yew what!
9571 : But Aht Urhgan's just too stubborn to pull its uppity head from the sand an' take a gander at its surroundings.
9572 : I s'spect Her Majesty's one of them po' folk as cain't breathe an' think at the same time, bless her heart... Makes me wish we could send a few airships--black as the night--to open up their ports an' give 'em some common sense.
9573 : Well, she was kind enough to let us officers into the country...after the negotiators we hired persuaded her. Either way, we've been doin' nothin' but watchin' the dust drift ever since we got here! It gets me soppin' mad just thinkin' about it!
9574 : I know they're a sovereign nation and all, but if they don't get pricked into action, those rascally Voidwalkers could knock the whole realm all cattywampus!
9575 : ...Or not. This wouldn't be the first time an apocalyptic vision fell flat on its face.
9576 : Anyway, what do yew say to layin' a thumpin' on these intruders from away? If that sounds like somethin' up yer alley, why not join the Voidwatch?
9577 : What will you do? Nothing at all. Ask many a question. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
9578 : I see where yew're comin' from. Why help those who won't help themselves? But this is us against them! Good versus evil! If yew're not part of the solution, yew're part of the problem!
9579 : Whoa, now! Stop pumpin' me with questions! I'm startin' to squirm like a skoffin in a snare!
9580 : If y'all go find one o' them there Voidwatch Officers, they'll set yew right as rain.
9581 : You're darn tootin' I'm angry! The Empire doesn't care a lick about the Voidwalker threat! We've got to do somethin', and soon...
9582 : Excuse me, but how'd yew like to throw a saddle on this challenge and ride it to fame and glory?
9583 : I knew a [true gent/loyal lady] like yew wouldn't [leave lil' ol' me to fend off those nasty beasts all on my lonesome/pass up a chance t' put some hurtin' on them as needs it]. If'n y'all wanna finish this here mission, yew'll need to brave the depths of Arrapago Reef, climb to dizzying heights on Mount Zhayolm, bushwhack yer way through Mamook, and keep from sinking into Caedarva Mire.
9584 : Oh, and yew'll need this % to get yew started on yer way to corrallin' those critters.
9585 : I hear pairin' them with % really gets the job done right, too. Anywho, y'all come back safe and sound from those battles now, y'hear?
9586 : If yew ever find that the goin's gittin' tough, I'll help yew git goin' again, hon. Come to me with any problem yew've got.
9587 : Yew still ain't put an end to yer operations. Hustle on over to [Arrapago Reef/Mount Zhayolm/Mamook/Caedarva Mire][, Mount Zhayolm/, Mamook/, Caedarva Mire/ fer yer final showdown./][, Mamook/, Caedarva Mire/, Mount Zhayolm/][, and Caedarva Mire.//You're almost there, hon./, and...I guess that does it.] Now quitcher lallygaggin' an' git back out there, %!
9588 : Those wily Voidwalkers have come back to rustle up some trouble in Arrapago Reef, Mount Zhayolm, Mamook, [and Caedarva Mire/Caedarva Mire, and Aydeewa Subterrane]! Yew've taken care of them before, so this time should be as easy as fightin' yer way outta a straw heap.
9589 : Well now, I heard yew been workin' harder 'n a one-legged man at a tail-kickin' contest. Wonderful work, hon!
9590 : Don't forget though, Voidwalkers always come back with a vengeance like ornery garden weeds.
9591 : And since we haven't found their roots yet, all we can do is cut them down every time they pop back up.
9592 : Yew'll be up against some darn stiff competition, but an experienced adventurer like yew can soften it up in no time, ain't that right, hon?
9593 : By golly, what now? ...The Immortals?
9594 : Are you that wench from the Middle Lands?
9595 : I'm from there, but I don't take kindly to bein' called a wench, deary.
9596 : You should learn to keep those lips of yours sealed.
9597 : Waste not your breath on this wench. We do not need any more secrets being leaked.
9598 : If yew want to talk to me about leaking, yew'd best check yer britches first. What do yew need, anyway?
9599 : A bizarre phenomenon has occurred in a nearby cavern. I believe you refer to them as...planar rifts. Those are indeed what you seek, are they not?
9600 : As you have no other business in Her Imperial Majesty's lands, you will deal with this menace immediately. That is all.
9601 : Good gracious, that man scares me more than shears do a moogle! Those beady eyes, that twisted scowl...I wouldn't bat an eye if someone told me he was a Voidwalker himself. I could've sworn he was fixin' to unhinge his jaws and swallow me whole!
9602 : Look! He was even scary enough to make yer % turn all diff'rnt! At least he told us somethin' about a distortion in a dank cavern that gets invaded by outlaws every night.
9603 : What? He didn't say anythin' like that? Well, I guess I just had to fill in the gaps myself! His description was sparser'n the hairs on my pappy's head! Anyway, I reckon Aydeewa Subterrane's the only cavern 'round these parts...
9604 : The Immortals said they discovered a planar rift in a cave 'round these parts. I wonder if that's Aydeewa Subterrane...
9605 : So yew stuck it to those Voidwalker vermin an' came out on top? Congratulations, sugar!
9606 : Looks like ol' scary-face was tellin' the truth about that there cavern, then.
9607 : I'll let yew do the thankin' though, darlin'. I'm afeared he's like t' gimme a new pie hole if'n I ever got near t' him again.
9608 : How many would you like? None. Just one. Fill me up!
