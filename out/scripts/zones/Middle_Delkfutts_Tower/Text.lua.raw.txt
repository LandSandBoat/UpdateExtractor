6985 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
6986 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?
6987 : [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
6988 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
6989 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
6990 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
6991 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6992 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6993 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6994 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6995 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6996 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6997 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6998 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6999 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7000 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7001 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7002 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7003 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7004 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7005 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7006 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7007 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7008 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7009 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7010 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7011 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7012 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7013 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7014 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7015 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7016 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7017 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7018 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7019 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7020 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7021 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7022 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7023 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7024 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7025 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7026 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7027 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7028 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7029 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7030 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7031 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7032 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7033 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7034 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7035 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7036 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7037 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7038 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7039 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7040 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7041 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7042 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7043 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7044 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7050 : Keep your eyes peeled! I'm going in for the big one!

7052 : I'm warmed up now. Time for a real attack!
7053 : Don't blink now! Follow my lead!
7054 : Are you ready? I'm taking my shot!
7055 : Alrighty! Here goes nothing!
7056 : Are you ready? I'm beginning my attack!

7091 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7092 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7093 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7094 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7095 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7096 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7097 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7098 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7099 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7100 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7101 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7102 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7103 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7104 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7105 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7106 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7107 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7108 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7109 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7110 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7111 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7112 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7113 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7114 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!
