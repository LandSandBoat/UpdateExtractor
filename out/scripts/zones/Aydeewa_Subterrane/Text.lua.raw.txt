6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7327 : You see something shiny on the ground...
7328 : Mining is possible here if you have %.
7329 : Your % breaks!
7330 : Obtained key item: %!
7331 : You dig up %, but your % breaks in the process.
7332 : You are unable to mine anything.
7333 : You cannot carry any more items. Your inventory is full.
7334 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7335 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7336 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7337 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7338 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7339 : Now, listen close...
7340 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.

7351 : Ah... The new potential...
7352 : I am Yasfel of the Immortals.
7353 : I regret to inform you that the % you have brought me was nothing more than a ruse.
7354 : We merely wished to test the limits of your innermost desire for power.
7355 : Yes... We needed to gauge your suitability...
7356 : You undertook what was, in essence, an unreasonable request, and completed the task admirably. Such commitment is worthy of praise...
7357 : But it all comes back to your search for power...
7358 : I stand before you as one who holds the only key to unlocking your potential.
7359 : Naturally, this power comes at a price. Something precious will be lost to you.
7360 : Though you may not even notice it is missing...
7361 : If you are willing to pay the price... If you truly desire the power that a blue mage wields...
7362 : Take my hand...
7363 : Take his hand? Yes. I don't think so...
7364 : You choose the safer path. So be it...
7365 : I will ask you one more question. Do you feel any regrets in your decision?
7366 : Any regrets? None. Maybe...
7367 : No regrets at all? None! Wait!
7368 : This was all nothing more than an unrealized dream. Return... Return to your safe, familiar world...
7369 : Do you truly take his hand? Yes! I've changed my mind.
7370 : Your life... ...now belongs to the Empress and the Empire...
7371 : ... The potential is ready for your inspection.
7372 : [His/Her] cobalt levels were very low, and I was afraid this would be another failure. But [he/she] somehow clawed [his/her] way back from the edge of death.
7373 : Hmph. [His/Her] answers were not entirely truthful.
7374 : You were the one who transplanted this!
7375 : This... ...loathsome Ahriman lens!
7376 : Hold your tongues. [He/She] awakens...
7377 : Congratulations, %. Welcome to the ranks of the blue mages.
7378 : However, at this moment you are but an empty vessel--a base creature, weaker than the most ordinary mortal.
7379 : A blue mage must wrest [his/her] strength and vitality from [his/her] enemies.
7380 : Show me your hunger for unrivaled power!
7381 : This is the only guidance I shall give you.
7382 : If you prove your worth, you may one day find a place among the Immortals.
7383 : You obtain the %. You can now become a blue mage!
7385 : ...
7386 : Mmmm...
7387 : Ahummm...
7388 : What!? What do you want!? How can I concentrate with you blathering in my ear!
7389 : <Groan...> I was so close to attuning myself to Aydeewa... All my effort has come to naught, thanks to you! What do you have to say for yourself!? Huh!?
7390 : Master craftsman? Why are you calling me that? My name is Kushdeel! Kushdeel, I tell you!
7391 : What? An order? An Immortal? Magus armor...?
7392 : ...
7393 : Ohnonono. I'm not falling for that one.
7394 : I know what you are. You're one of those adventurers they've been talking about in the port, come to look for me at pretty Lathuya's request.
7395 : You thought I'd just come along quietly if you spouted some clever story, didn't you? Sorry, but old Kushdeel is a little sharper than that.
7396 : Now, resonating my spirit with the aura of Aydeewa, that will really inspire my creativity...
7397 : Hm? I was just getting to the interesting part... You can't even sit still and listen to an artist speak of his muse?
7398 : You have some document to show me? Some love letter from Lathuya, I'll bet. Honestly, I don't know what to do with that girl...
7399 : ... Excellent, all the materials have arrived. I have to hurry back to town!
7400 : And you. It may not look like it, but I'm a busy man. Don't keep me waiting.
7401 : See you back at the store!
7402 : DEBUG: Press a button to continue.
7403 : % sets the % on the ground.
7404 : Hooo! What is this wooonderful wooonderful smell?

7406 : Nooo here, hohoho! Stooo from the roooins...for Wawaroon! Time for a feast!
7407 : Ack...ghmph?
7408 : You see a roll of parchment in Wawaroon's bag.
7409 : Take the parchment? Yes! I am no thief.
7410 : You rummage through Wawaroon's bag...
7411 : At least he is still breathing...
7412 : You discover %! But of what use could another one be? You carefully return it.
7413 : There is a mushroom growing here. It might grow larger if it had some fertilizer.
7414 : There is a mushroom growing here.
7415 : There are traces indicating that a mushroom was growing here.
7416 : The mushroom has grown into a monster!
7417 : The mushroom seems to have grown a bit.
7418 : The mushroom does not need any more fertilizer now.
7419 : Nothing happens.
7420 : You pull up the mushroom and obtain %!
7421 : You pull up the mushroom and obtain %!

7449 : Oh! Let me see!
7450 : Is this snail-like thing an Olduum treasure?
7451 : <Burooroon>...
7452 : <Burooroon...rooroon>...
7453 : Ahahaha! Sooo luckeee luckeee!
7454 : <Burooroonrooroon>...

7465 : They dig up swirly-swirly treasure! Ooover.
7466 : I've seen this pattern somewhere before...
7467 : It does look familiar. Now where...?
7468 : Hmmm...
7469 : Hmmm.
7470 : Hmmm?
7472 : The Hall of Binding!?
7473 : But, Aphmau. The shape is quite different from the Astral Candescence.
7474 : That's true...
7475 : Although, that would make sense, Ovjang.
7476 : A candescence would never be kept down here.
7477 : This is probably simply a poor copy of the real thing.
7478 : Really? This one seems to be much older, though...
7479 : It makes no difference. I'm just glad this isn't a real candescence.
7480 : Oh?
7481 : I mean, I have no interest...
7482 : No interest at all...
7484 : Those are Qiqirn...
7485 : ...of the unfriendly variety!
7486 : Ovjang, quick!
7487 : !?
7488 : Aphmau! They're still after us!

7507 : Aha! W-Wawaroon not rat!
7508 : We have nothing to give to the likes of you!
7509 : Oho. That one carries something in her pooocket! Rooroon!

7535 : Y-yes...
7536 : (H-help...)
7537 : Louder.
7538 : Help...
7539 : Louder!

7551 : !!!
7552 : Uwaaa! Fleeee! Fleee! Roorooroon!
7553 : Gogoroon hates the big kabooom!
7554 : Ohohohohoho!
7555 : It seems my little incantation, was a wee bit too much stimulation!
7556 : Aha...!
7557 : The swirly-swirly treasure belong tooo Wawaroon! Weee nooo forget this!
7558 : HehEheHEhE...

7566 : King of Hearts, that is quite enough. There is no reason to be so rough.
7567 : Now was this our very first greeting?
7568 : Or will this be our second meeting...?
7569 : We've never met!
7570 : I am Karababa from the nation of Windurst, an ambassador foremost and first.
7571 : ...
7572 : Have I done something to cause you grief? Was my introduction overly brief?
7573 : You have...
7574 : You have done something unforgivable!
7575 : My precious Mnejing...
7576 : MneJiNg?Who iSthAt?
7577 : A friend.
7578 : Don't tell me you've forgotten what you did to him.

7581 : ArE thErEmaNY maLfuNCtiONiNgpuPPeTs iNthiS naTioN?
7582 : Show some damn respect!
7583 : You have no right to speak to us in such a manner.
7584 : Such insolence!
7585 : This puppet has no desire to converse. Stubbornness is such a curse.
7586 : I haven't forgiven you either!
7587 : I see that we have no other course. King, do your worst without remorse!
7588 : This puppet shows some skill with magic. Though the lack of control is rather tragic.
7589 : HehEheHEhE... LaDyKaRabAbA. I aMnOt coNceRNeD.
7590 : I haVErEcEntLY LEarNedsoME mAgiC oFmY oWn.

7600 : LaDyKaRabAbA! I haVEfOUnd iT!
7601 : Quickly, hand it over.
7602 : Does it have the insulation cover...?
7603 : I think it's time to say farewell, while these others recover from your spell.
7604 : No one minds if I take this treasure? We must be off, it's been a pleasure!
7605 : LaDyKaRabAbA. No oNeseEMs tOobJEcT.
7606 : So little time, so much to do.
7607 : We really should now say adieu!
7608 : This should be shown to the alchemists of the Empire. These scant remains may be all that they require.
7609 : YoU haVesoME cLuEaS tO tHEnaTuRE oFthiS oBjECt?
7610 : That will be a task for Rodin-Comidin, though he's sure to make a fuss.
7611 : Our next stop will be a certain mercenary company--we've business to discuss.
7612 : Oh!BusiNesSaT laSt!
7613 : We gotta hurry, Boss! There are lotsa people headed this way.
7614 : Yes... Noticed, we have.
7615 : They're here!
7616 : Grand Vizier!
7617 : She is safe!
7618 : ...
7619 : My brother...?
7620 : Of all the irresponsible...
7621 : Back to the palace with her.
7622 : A moment, sir...
7623 : Grand Vizier. This mercenary...
7624 : [His/Her] name?
7625 : %, sir...
7626 : Listen well, %.
7627 : Speak not a word of this to anyone. If you defy me...
7628 : ...your life is forfeit.
7629 : However...
7630 : Your assistance here today will not be forgotten.
7631 : Ohooohooo. Immooortals have big clink clink! Weee beee luckeee today!
7632 : Weee beee sooo luckeee tooo listen tooo Wawaroon!
7633 : Gogoroon luckeee! Gogoroon love sound of clink clink!

7657 : Ugh...
7658 : Where...? Who's there...?
7659 : !?
7660 : Oh...it's you...
7661 : I wonder how long I was out...
7662 : I didn't hear or sense anything until someone was right behind me...
7663 : I must be getting careless.
7664 : Who would be bold enough to assault an Immortal?
7665 : But I've wasted too much time already--I have to find...
7666 : Hey, what are you doing here, anyway?
7667 : Hm?
7668 : You were sent by the Grand Vizier?
7669 : You're too late. It seems I arrived here after Aphmau had already left.
7670 : You can still see Hume and automaton footprints all over the place...
7671 : I'm certain she was here.
7672 : But I don't think she found any sign of Ovjang.
7673 : How do I know that?
7674 : I had just found her dragging footprints heading out of the tunnels, as if she had given up.
7675 : And then everything went black...
7676 : All is not lost, however. I think I know where she went.
7677 : Walahra Temple.
7678 : I'm almost certain she would return there...
7679 : Let's get moving!
7680 : Whoa...
7681 : My head is...still spinning...
7682 : %.
7683 : You must return to Al Zahbi and make sure she's okay.
7684 : I...
7685 : I have to see her before the other Immortals figure out where she is.
7686 : No time to lose!
7687 : There are mushrooms growing here.
7688 : You find a %!
7689 : You pick a mature %.
7690 : There is nothing left here to pick.
7691 : You no longer need a %.
7692 : There is a sparse patch of mushrooms growing here.
7693 : There is a dense patch of mushrooms growing here.
7694 : However, you were unable to find a %.
7695 : Plant the % here?
7696 : Plant the mushroom here? Yes, here. No, not here.
7697 : You gently plant the % in the soil.
7698 : You don't see any new sprouts yet.
7699 : You see a newly sprouted %!
7700 : Harvest the sprouts?
7701 : Harvest the sprouts? Harvest away. Not yet.
7702 : You harvest 1 sprout!
7703 : You harvest 2 sprouts!
7704 : You find an extra hidden sprout!
7705 : You pick a total of # [sprout/sprouts].
7706 : However, you cannot carry any more sprouts.
7707 : You pick a total of # [sprout/sprouts]!
7708 : Don't move a muscle...
7709 : How much do you know?
7710 : If you dig any deeper, I'll bury you rrright here.
7711 : Hmph, so you're gonna play it that way?
7712 : Fine. You're as good as dead, anyway. Why don't I thrrrow you a bone?
7713 : As you've prrrobably already found out, I'm not a citizen of Aht Urhgan. My home is the island nation of Tsahya.
7714 : The Empire has several vassal states, and Tsahya is one of them...
7715 : It may be subject to Imperial law, but Tsahya has been grrranted autonomy and is allowed to field an independent defense force.
7716 : We have an Imperial governor-general, and our people are grrranted the same rights as Imperial citizens. Or at least, so the law says...
7717 : My family was a wealthy farming household that rrraised popotoes--one of the staples of our nation's diet.
7718 : Then one day, a new agricultural land law was passed by the governor-general that put my family in the poorhouse. Almost all of our property was seized by the Empire...
7719 : My life changed suddenly and completely. All I could think about was where my next meal was coming from...
7720 : And the final kick in the guts was when the entire village was forced to switch their crops from popotoes to pamamas because of some new crrraze in Al Zahbi.
7721 : The thing is, none of the villagers were used to raising fruit...and the entire plantation withered before the first harvest. With no food, or money to import supplies, many people died of starvation. Including my own mother...
7722 : With no home and no family, I did whatever it took to stay alive. Every day was a strrruggle.
7723 : Then, when I was thirteen, I lied about my age and enlisted in the Tsahyan Self-Defense Force--mostly because I'd heard they fed you prrroperly.
7724 : But it was like I had trrraded one hell for another. Once they found out I was only thirteen, I was forced to join the Tsahyan Freedom Fighters, a covert unit kept secret from the Empire.
7725 : This was the dark face of the Tsahyan Self-Defense Force--a special forces unit that trrrained assassins as the ultimate weapons in the plan to secure true independence for our nation.
7726 : I was officially rrreported as deceased, and then came the unending days of assassination training. And once I had learned everything they had to teach me...
7727 : The Freedom Fighters prepared a false identity for me as Mihli, the Tsahyan philosophy student, and sent me to Walahra Temple.
7728 : It's done...
7729 : Greetings, soldier of Tsahya.
7730 : I trrrust you left no trace of yourself?
7731 : None.
7732 : You are to be prrraised for the important duty you have carried out. Your mother would be prrroud.
7733 : ...
7734 : What is it?
7735 : It's just that this all seems so pointless...
7736 : There's no end to the cockrrroaches in Aht Urhgan who use their position to exploit the vassal states...
7737 : Every time I crrrush one, another one scurries in to take his place. Nothing will change until the entire country changes...
7738 : Then you've come to understand the crrrux of the problem, Mihli.
7739 : We have rrreached the final stage of our plan...
7740 : And now we have the perfect opportunity to execute it.
7741 : I hear there'll be a ceremony at the palace in the near future to award scholarships to the brrright young students from Walahra Temple.
7742 : Why would that...?
7743 : And with your excellent grrrades, you've been selected to represent the student body, haven't you, Mihli?
7744 : ...?
7745 : This kind of chance will never come again. You will attend this ceremony...
7746 : ...and assassinate the Empress.
7747 : !!!
7748 : Don't be concerned. It's trrraditional for Her Magnificence to be present at this event. You will have ample time to strrrike a killing blow.
7749 : And what happens to me? How will I escape the palace guards...?
7750 : You won't.
7751 : ...
7752 : Mihli, has your soft, student life clouded your memories?
7753 : Have you forgotten why you were chased from your home? Why your mother died?
7754 : ...
7755 : I'll do it...
7756 : Now that's the Tsahyan Mihli I know. Your glory will be sung by the Freedom Fighters down through the ages.
7757 : A map of the palace has been secreted in the usual location. Begin your preparrrations immediately.
7758 : May the spirits watch over you, Mihli...
7759 : May the spirits watch over the Freedom Fighters...
7760 : Do you think she'll succeed?
7761 : Not likely... But it will frrreeze the blood of those Imperial curs to know how close their prrrecious Empress came to death.
7762 : And, of course, we still have a couple more potential arrows being sharpened in the meantime...
7763 : We're too late!
7764 : Weren't you supposed to be off this investigation, General Rughadjeen?
7765 : This madness has even claimed the former Grand Vizier...!
7766 : The spinal cord has been cleanly severed between the third and fourth vertebrae. How could someone...?
7767 : A chakram. It's a circular throwing weapon with a sharp outer edge.
7768 : Very observant. Our killer is becoming bolder with each new victim...but this has also helped us create a more solid profile.
7769 : You think the vassal states are involved in some way?
7770 : It is likely. The former Grand Vizier was also once the governor-general for the southern nations.
7771 : Of particular note is his enactment of a new agricultural land law in Tsahya that led to large swathes of property being seized from wealthy farming families...
7772 : ...and the resulting deaths to starvation when the newly imposed plantations failed.
7773 : How could such a man be promoted to the position of Grand Vizier...?
7774 : Dissidents were ruthlessly suppressed. Heavy taxes were levied, and reparations paid for losses. On the books, he appears compassionate and efficient.
7775 : The facts at hand suggest our murderer is a member of the Tsahyan Freedom Fighters.
7776 : The Tsahyan Freedom Fighters!? The Immortals were supposed to have crushed that organization.
7777 : Apparently some of the rats survived.
7778 : Only an assassin trained by the Freedom Fighters would have the requisite skill to calculate the speed of a walking man and remove his head with a throwing disc...
7779 : Can we assume the next target will hold a higher position?
7780 : The present Grand Vizier is away from the capital on a tour of inspection. Which leaves the killer with a choice between a member of the Imperial family or the Empress Herself.
7781 : I will have my soldiers stationed within the palace grounds immediately.
7782 : That will not be necessary. The Immortals have an impenetrable security net.
7783 : Not even the famed ninja of the East could slip in unnoticed.
7784 : But wait. Was there not some ceremony scheduled to be held in the palace in the next few days?
7785 : The Empress will be present to award a student with the Walahra Scholarship.
7786 : However, the only other attendees will be a single tutor and several youths from the temple. There are no surging crowds in which an assassin could hide.
7787 : I would not underestimate the ingenuity of the Tsahyan Freedom Fighters.
7788 : You have a point. But I ask you to entrust the security of the palace grounds to the Immortals.
7789 : The Empress's life is in your hands.
7790 : ...
7791 : General Rughadjeen. Perhaps the Serpent Generals should...
7792 : I have a plan. Let us speak with Her Magnificence...
7793 : Calm yourself, Najelith. I have a plan...
7794 : Scholars of the Walahran philosophies. You have mastered the course of study set before you...
7795 : Your accomplishments are the pride of the Empress, and the pride of the Empire...
7796 : We hope the scholarships you are to be awarded today will support you in your future endeavors...
7797 : (The target sits behind that curtain... I must slip inside to be certain of the kill...)
7798 : (One, two, three, four Immortals in the immediate vicinity... I'll have just one chance at this...)
7799 : !?
7800 : (What the...!?)
7801 : (Where is the Empress...!?)
7802 : Mihli Aliapoh, please present the student address.
7803 : !!!
7804 : Mihli Aliapoh...?
7805 : Dammit!
7806 : !?
7807 : Ugh, my eyes!
7808 : Compose yourself! It is only an irritant.
7809 : Empress! Your Magnificence!
7810 : (Captain Raubahn... I only see Mnejing...)
7811 : (Captain Raubahn... The Empress is not...)
7812 : (The temple...? You've got a lot to answer for, Rughadjeen!)
7813 : Here she comes...
7814 : That was fast. How'd she know where to go?
7815 : Good, I was tired of waiting.
7816 : Let us make the first move...
7817 : !?
7818 : We cannot allow you to pass.
7819 : ...
7820 : The recent murders...they were your doing?
7821 : ...!
7822 : Wait! I can solve this without weapons.
7823 : Hey, you there! Come quietly, or I'll have to get rough...
7824 : Is that supposed to be a threat, old man?
7825 : Old man!?
7826 : Clear the way! I'll take care of this!
7827 : No!
7828 : !?
7829 : Gadalar! Are you trying to burn the temple down!?
7830 : ...!!!
7831 : Idiots...
7832 : There's no escape! Give yourself up!
7833 : Hmph. Let's see you stop me!
7834 : Wha-!
7835 : Is this big sword just for show?
7836 : <Whistle>
7837 : Oof...!
7838 : How...!
7840 : !!
7841 : !!!
7842 : It's been fun!
7843 : After her!
7844 : Who's there?
7845 : Mihli!
7846 : I almost couldn't believe it when I saw the automaton at the palace...
7847 : I almost couldn't brrring myself to believe it..
7848 : A pity...
7849 : I-I'm sorry, Mihli. Are you angry with me? You left the temple before I could congratulate you...
7851 : I was so looking forward to seeing you at the ceremony, but Rughadjeen bade me stay here... I'm glad we have this chance to talk!
7852 : ...
7853 : Seize her!
7854 : Stay back!
7855 : ...!
7856 : M-Mihli...?
7857 : Stay your blade! What is it you want?
7858 : What do I want...? I wanted vengeance for my mother...
7859 : ...
7860 : But now...I wish for nothing...
7861 : My vengeance... Aphmau, I...
7863 : Ugh...
7864 : I've seen enough of your incompetence, General Rughadjeen.
7865 : Raubahn.
7866 : All four of the generals in charge of the defense of the city couldn't apprehend a single girl...?
7867 : ...
7868 : Our performance was deplorable...
7869 : As was ours, I'm afraid to say. I never considered our charge would be outside the palace.
7870 : The Immortals will take responsibility for processing this crime. What is the punishment for high treason?
7871 : Death by fire.
7872 : Proceed!
7873 : ...
7874 : Wait!
7875 : There must be some mistake... This girl is--
7876 : ...a friend!
7878 : A friend, you say?
7879 : Mihli has always been kind to me here at the temple. She stood up for me when I was teased by the other students...
7880 : But...
7881 : Assuming Mihli is an...assassin...wouldn't that mean the Immortals and the generals failed to carry out their sworn duty?
7882 : That is correct...
7883 : Failure to protect a member of the Imperial family is punishable by--
7884 : Beheading.
7885 : ...
7886 : Hey, now, let's not be so hasty!
7887 : Shall we bring an end to this case right here and now?
7888 : I do not wish to lose any of you to a misunderstanding...
7889 : There is still the matter of--
7890 : Please trust in my judgment.
7891 : ...
7892 : Please, Raubahn...
7893 : Understood.
7894 : Why are you doing this?
7895 : There is more to Aht Urhgan than you've allowed yourself to see.
7896 : Maybe you just need a little more time before your fate is decided...
7897 : Aphmau...
7898 : That meek, wisp of a girl stood up to the Immortals to save me...
7899 : She said rather than complain about the way things were, we should work together to make a brrrighter future for everyone in the Empire.
7900 : After that incident, I was placed under General Rughadjeen's command, and put in charge of counter-espionage.
7901 : I even rrreceived a medal for my work in capturing Far Eastern ninja, and preventing Lamiae sabotage.
7902 : Of course, I had to cut all ties with the Freedom Fighters, who now consider me a trrraitor to the cause...
7903 : But I still rrrefuse to expose their true identities. General Rughadjeen has come to accept my stubbornness in that rrregard...
7904 : And then, one day...
7905 : Commander Mihli.
7906 : You are to be commended for your actions in preventing the Mamool Ja's plan to sink the Imperial Fleet.
7907 : Without your intervention, who knows how many ships we would have lost, not to mention essential provisions for the capital.
7908 : Mihli Aliapoh. In light of your achievements, you are hereby promoted to the position of Springserpent General.
7909 : So...you mean I...
7910 : Yes. From this day forward, the four generals become five. Welcome to our ranks, General Mihli.
7911 : Gahahaha! And I'll be damned if I'll let anyone contest the decision. You've done yourself proud!
7912 : Congratulations, Mihli. We are lucky to have you.
7913 : Heh, not another misfit... Try to keep out from underfoot.
7914 : I... Thank you...
7915 : And today, we are also blessed with an audience with Her Magnificence.
7916 : I am honored...
7917 : Raise your head, Springserpent General.
7918 : We have a favor to ask of you...
7919 : Anything, Your Magnificence...
7920 : The dagger does not suit a student of philosophy. We wish for you to wield this club and shield in its place...
7921 : A...club and shield...?
7922 : We believe you will recognize the materials used in their creation...
7923 : These...these are made of Tsahyan rrrosewood and Tsahyan ebony wood!
7924 : Correct. You are yet the hope of your people, Mihli...
7925 : We wish for you to fight for their sake, as well as the Empire's.
7926 : Springserpent General Mihli. Our fr...loyal subject.
7927 : Springserpent General Mihli. Our...loyal subject.
7928 : Until my last brrreath...
7929 : (You are still the only opponent I have ever met crazy enough to leap onto the flat of my blade...)
7930 : (Hehehe. Crrrazy? Your sword was practically standing still the way I saw it.)
7931 : (We shall have to take that duel to its conclusion one day.)
7932 : (Anytime, old man. We alrrready know who'll win that bout...)
7933 : (Hahaha, you'll not surprise me this time. But I'll wait until you've had time to practice with that club.)
7934 : For generals, you both sound very much like boasting children...
7935 : Gahahahaha!
7936 : And that was that. You've been so quiet, I've prrractically spilled my whole life story...
7937 : By the way, do you know why I had you bring the %?
7938 : It's actually a collection of locks from the people I've assassinated.
7939 : I meant to prrresent it to the Freedom Fighters after my last assignment was complete, but was never able to thrrrow it away...
7940 : I keep it to rrremind me of the evil in the world...theirs and mine.
7941 : I was frrrantic to have lost it... The Immortals could still use that hair to convict me of my crrrimes even after all this time.
7942 : So, what do you plan to do with it?
7943 : What will you do with it? Return it to Mihli. Hand it in to the Immortals.
7944 : Huh...
7945 : I used to often drrream about the time when my mother died and I was all alone--a terrible drrream, where all sense of hope is gone.
7946 : But now, those drrreams are gone. I wake up in the morning and think of the faces of my companions and the soldiers under my command. Even the face of the Empress...
7947 : I don't expect my crrrimes to ever be forgiven. But I still mean to serve the Empress until her drrreams for the future have been fulfilled.
7948 : But now, those drrreams are gone. I wake up in the morning and think of the faces of my companions and the soldiers under my command.
7949 : I don't expect my crrrimes to ever be forgiven. But I mean to keep fighting until Aphmau's drrreams for the future have been fulfilled.
7950 : Wait, what am I babbling about...?
7951 : Leave me be!
7952 : Listen close. I might not kill you now, but if you let the wrrrong words slip in the wrrrong place...
7953 : See you around, mercenary!
7954 : And...thank you!
7955 : Hey! I-I'll do anything... Just p-please don't...
7956 : Yoink!
7957 : The % was snatched out of your hand!
7958 : Now, what am I going to do with you? I could just slit you open like a pig...
7959 : But I'm sure the Empress wouldn't apprrrove. You live for today.
7960 : But I'm sure Aphmau wouldn't apprrrove. You live for today.
7961 : Maybe you can find a new clue to incrrriminate me? Of course, I'll be there to dissuade you.
7962 : I rrreally should be getting back--I have a long list of duties. Playtime with you is over!
7963 : See you arrround, mercenary!
7964 : Who dares disturb these gates? Pathetic mortal, what foolishness has brought you here? No matter, your fate is now irrevocably sealed. Come now, do not fear. Embrace your death!
7965 : This is the end...of nothing... Defeating me proves only that you harbor the seeds of evil within your trembling flesh... Someday...they shall come...to fruition...
7966 : Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
7967 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
7968 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
7969 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
7970 : You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
7971 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
7972 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
7973 : Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
7974 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
7975 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
7976 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
7977 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
7978 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
7979 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
7980 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
7981 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
7982 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
7983 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
7984 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
7985 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
7986 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
7987 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
7988 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
7989 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
7990 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
7991 : You can only carry one %.
7992 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
7993 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
7994 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
7995 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
7996 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
7997 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
7998 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
7999 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
8000 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
8001 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
8002 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
8003 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
8004 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
8005 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...
8006 : Unable to enter next area. Expansion pack not installed.
8007 : You sense an ominous presence...
8008 : The heady fragrance of wine pervades the air...

8037 : The ground is smeared with bloodstains...

8093 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
8094 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
8095 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
8096 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
8097 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
8098 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
8099 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
8100 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
8101 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
8102 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
8103 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
8104 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
8105 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
8106 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
8107 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
8108 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
8109 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
8110 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
8111 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
8112 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
8113 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
8114 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
8115 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
8116 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
8117 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
8118 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
8119 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
8120 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
8121 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
8122 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
8123 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
8124 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
8125 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
8126 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
8127 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
8128 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
8129 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
8130 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
8131 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
8132 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.

8997 : Sorry to keep you waiting. We've finished making the preparations for our research.
8998 : I have been on numerous research trips, but these two are quite new to the process.
8999 : Even when I tell them to remain calm and keep their wits about them, they don't seem to listen. Therefore, I'd like you to keep an eye out for any trouble.
9000 : Also, in the event we're forced to fight, try not to damage the ruins.
9001 : Um, Mister Ghatsad!? I have a question!
9002 : What is it?
9003 : So, you want us to search these ruins and try to find something nobody's ever discovered before, right?
9004 : That's correct. The two of you have studied the basics of the Olduum civilization, correct?
9005 : Of course! I must've read the legend of Ramuh about a thousand times!
9006 : The Olduum civilization was a maritime nation located near the waters of the Gugru Blue several thousand years ago.
9007 : Within the nation lived a great individual, one who created numerous items and vehicles powered by lightning.
9008 : Thanks to those wondrous inventions, their civilization developed way beyond that of the surrounding nations.
9009 : However, their society eventually began to decay. I suppose you know the reason why?
9010 : Do you know the reason? Of course. I'm not sure.
9011 : Of course you do--mercenaries know everything...
9012 : Heheheh... I'll tell you then.
9013 : It's because that brilliant inventor disappeared from the country.
9014 : The sheer greatness possessed by that one individual terrified everyone else.
9015 : I suppose they simply weren't capable of comprehending such genius.
9016 : And without the inventor, the people were unable to understand the technology left behind either.
9017 : That is why I believe that this individual that appears in the story is none other than Ramuul.
9018 : Ramuul!?
9019 : Um, who is that again?
9020 : Have you already forgotten!? He was the wielder of the Olduum staff in the story that Megomak told us about!
9021 : That is correct. Furthermore, the mysterious stone tablets are also from the Olduum civilization.
9022 : Therefore, I believe it is only natural to assume that the wielder of the staff and the inventor from the story are one and the same.
9023 : I see... Ramuul sounds a lot like the name that appears in the mythology books.
9024 : They are similar, yes, but I don't think that's what the boss is talking about.
9025 : If my theory is correct, then the Olduum staff is capable of much more than just controlling the stone tablets.
9026 : In fact, I believe it is the key to unlocking the mysteries of the Olduum civilization itself.
9027 : What!?
9028 : Th-that's amazing! We've got to find that staff, boss!
9029 : Indeed we do... The sooner we find it and can study it, the better.
9030 : We'll do our best to try and find a hint as to where the staff might be located!
9031 : Huh? Did you see a Qiqirn lurking over there just now?
9032 : Abda-Lurabda, stop your nonsense and let's get going already!
9033 : Hey, no fair!
9034 : Okay, let's get started. Keep an eye out for any potential trouble, %.
9035 : Yikes! There are monsters everywhere! I've got to stay calm and not freak out...
9036 : Although, what's really terrifying is that look Mister Ghatsad sometimes gets in his eyes...
9037 : I wonder if it's because he never gets any sleep. Or maybe it's something else...
9038 : Now I'm really starting to get worried. Mister Ghatsad can be as scary as they come.
9039 : Look at these magnificent pillars.
9040 : <Sigh> I would like to see the Olduum civilization at the height of its glory, if only once...
9041 : No! As a researcher, I must remain objective and not be influenced by such sentiment!
9042 : You see, I researched this before coming here, but there are many mysterious ruins scattered throughout the world.
9043 : I was looking for some kind of comparison. For example, there are large white ruins throughout the Middle Lands, right?
9044 : All of the literature states that they are from the Zilart civilization.
9045 : They also are known for possessing functionality and various responses that still aren't fully understood to this day.
9046 : Perhaps they are related to these items and vehicles from the Olduum civilization that are powered by lightning?
9047 : How exciting would it be if these two mysterious civilizations were somehow related? Heheheh.
9048 : [Tateeya/Abda-Lurabda/Ghatsad] appears to have moved on. Try searching another location.
9049 : Look. This symbol carved into the rock resembles an eye.
9050 : Some theorize this symbol to mean someone who never sleeps.
9051 : Which can also mean those that never die, or perhaps transcend what we know about reincarnation.
9052 : Historically, those in power tend to try and find ways to achieve immortality once their civilization has reached a certain level of prosperity and stability.
9053 : However, some say that the ruler of the Olduum civilization was already immortal.
9054 : If that ruler truly was Ramuul, I wonder how he managed to discover the secret to immortality.
9055 : That reminds me, the Immortals that appeared near the stone tablet also had some sort of eye-like marking.
9056 : According to the Serpent Generals, the ones bearing that mark are in possession of powerful magical ability.
9057 : I don't get that feeling from the marking on these ruins though. It seems to be a simple engraving, and not related to our research.
9058 : There is no one here. Perhaps you should check a different location.
9059 : Hey, you've got a pretty good eye for detail despite being a mercenary!
9060 : Yes indeed. I'm also curious to know what lies beyond here...
9061 : Tateeya, see if you can climb up there.
9062 : Sure thing, boss! I'll be right back!
9063 : Um... Isn't that kind of dangerous?
9064 : Yikes!
9065 : Wh-what is that!?
9066 : Nooo matter! Please, heeelp us!
9067 : Ahahaha! Wawaroon and friends need heeelp!
9068 : Gogoroon not likeee this at all!
9069 : Oh no! It's attacking us too!
9070 : %, help!

9074 : I am soo luckeee! Wawaroon and friends are saved!
9075 : Vavaroon luckeee tooo! Thank yooou all!
9076 : Your names sound familiar... Yes, now I remember. It was when the Empress was attacked...
9077 : Huh!? These Qiqirn are enemies of Her Majesty!? Should we have helped them!?
9078 : Heeey! We dooon't know anything about that!
9079 : Yeah, yeah. You mistakeee us for ooother Qiqirn! Yes?
9080 : That aside, what was that thing?
9081 : We sooought seeecret treasure! Sooo we came here to look!
9082 : That was a marolith. It proootects Olduum!
9083 : Oh! I never knew that monster possessed such a function!
9084 : Maroliths are a mooonster created by Ramuul!
9085 : What did you say!? I was just thinking of that exact possibility!
9086 : Ahahaha! Wawaroon was fasteeer!
9087 : Very well, but tell me this... Do you know anything about the Olduum staff?
9088 : Hmm... I guess I can't say we dooon't know anything about it!
9089 : If we had the staff, the marolith wooouldn't attack Wawaroon!
9090 : Still... The Olduum staff is veeery scary.
9091 : The eye mooonsters attack you if you have the staff!
9092 : The eye monsters... Could that be a reference to the Immortals that appeared at the stone tablet?
9093 : Although, if they say the wielder of the staff is attacked, then that must mean that it's happened before.
9094 : Exactly! It's ooowned by a Mamool Ja warrior!
9095 : Ramuul ooonce burned many Mamool Ja!
9096 : Hating humans, he went oooff to liveee on a remote island in sadness!
9097 : Then a yoooung Mamool Ja came, seeking revengeee.
9098 : However, the yoooung Mamool Ja reeeceived the staff and made a promiseee to never give the staff to a human.
9099 : So Ramuul entrusted the staff to a Mamool Ja!?
9100 : I find such a thing hard to believe...
9101 : Yes, it really happened, a looong, looong time ago!
9102 : If the Mamool Ja breaks the promiseee, bad things will happen! The staff's magic will be lost, oookay?
9103 : No, it's not okay! I don't understand a word you just said!
9104 : Ahahaha! It's best yooou don't understand. People can't be trusteeed with the staff.
9105 : Hm?
9106 : <Burooroon>! Wawaroon and friends must be leeeaving now!
9107 : Hey, wait!
9108 : Sooorry, no time to wasteee. Thanks though.
9109 : There was so much more I wanted to ask them...
9110 : I don't think I understood a word they said...
9111 : Indeed... However, this trip has proved quite educational.
9112 : Really!? Then that means it's a success!
9113 : We're heading back to the workshop. We need to consult the literature and see what else we can find.
9114 : Understood, boss!
9115 : Hey, come pay me a visit later. I have something I want to give you.
9116 : Return to Aht Urhgan Whitegate and speak to Abda-Lurabda.
