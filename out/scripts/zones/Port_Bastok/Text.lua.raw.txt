6756 : (DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!
6757 : Welcome, Master! This is your home, the Mog House, kupo!
6758 : I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!
6759 : I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!
6760 : First, the basics, kupo! Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to Mog House when you're in your Mog House, kupo!
6761 : Press it and the Mog House menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
6762 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
6763 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
6764 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
6765 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
6766 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
6767 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
6768 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
6769 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
6770 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
6771 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
6772 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
6773 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
6774 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
6775 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
6776 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
6777 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
6778 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
6779 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
6780 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
6781 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!
6782 : It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!
6783 : You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!
6784 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
6785 : Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
6786 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
6787 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
6788 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
6789 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
6790 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
6791 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
6792 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
6793 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
6794 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
6795 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
6796 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
6797 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
6798 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
6799 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
6800 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
6801 : It's all yours, kupo!
6802 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!

6813 : This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6814 : Something clattered inside the % when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
6815 : It's all yours, kupo!
6816 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
6817 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6818 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
6819 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
6820 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
6821 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
6822 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
6823 : Each item of furniture you place using the Layout command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
6824 : When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!

6833 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
6834 : Look what I found in your %!

6840 : It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
6841 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
6842 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
6843 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
6844 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
6845 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
6846 : Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
6847 : Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
6848 : We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
6849 : Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
6850 : Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your %, when this % just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
6851 : Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6852 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6853 : Look at what I found while cleaning out the %: %!
6854 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6856 : It all began with a raindrop,      or so the legend says...
6857 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
6858 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
6859 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
6860 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
6861 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
6862 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
6863 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
6864 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
6865 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
6866 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
6867 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
6868 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
6869 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
6870 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
6871 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
6872 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...

7209 : Go where?(List scrolls down) Stay here. San d'Oria. Windurst. Ghelsba lift. Valley of hot springs. Ronfaure Forest.
7210 : The airship will [arrive/depart] in [less than an hour/about 1 hour/about 2 hours/about 3 hours/about 4 hours/about 5 hours/about 6 hours/about 7 hours] (# [minute/minutes] in Earth time).
7211 : The airship will [arrive/depart] soon.
7212 : You need an airship pass to go through here.
7213 : In the Gustaberg Mountains of Southern Quon lies the industrial nation known as the Republic of Bastok.
7214 : Compared to San d'Oria, with its legendary orders of knights, or Windurst, with its ancient institutes of magic, Bastok is still but a newborn nation.
7215 : But advanced technology and near limitless underground resources have allowed Bastok to rival the other two nations in power.
7216 : Innovative and adaptable Humes make up more than half the population of Bastok.
7217 : With their flair for industry, economy, and politics, they were the driving force behind Bastok's rapid growth. Even now, Humes hold key positions in those areas.
7218 : The Galka, a race of hulking humanoids, comprise a third of Bastok's population. Originally hailing from Zepwell, they came to this land over six hundred years ago.
7219 : Without their incomparable strength, the countless ore mines that drive Bastok's economy would never have been dug.
7220 : Adventurers seeking fame and fortune flock to rising nations like Bastok. You are one of them.
7221 : Your story begins here, amid the smoke and bustle of the industrial city of Bastok.
7222 : Why!? Why won't you let me go outside!?
7223 : As I've said, we have strict orders not to let you pass, Milady. It'll mean our heads if we let you go outside!
7224 : But why!?
7225 : Well, uh...
7226 : You know as well as we do, Milady.
7227 : Please, I'll only be gone a second! I have to help a friend!
7228 : Did this friend of yours ask you to risk your life? You know how dangerous it is outside.
7229 : Well, no, but...
7230 : That's what I thought. You should know better than to go meddling in other people's affairs, Milady.
7231 : ...
7232 : Hey, what'd you go and upset her for? What if she tells the boss?
7233 : Oh... Hi there. Were you there the whole time? Aren't I pitiful? Not even allowed out of the city gates by myself...
7234 : I'm sorry, I didn't mean to gripe. You look like a fledgling adventurer. Is this your first time in Bastok?
7235 : First time in Bastok? Yes. No.
7236 : Welcome to Bastok, then. I'd show you around, but I'm a little busy right now...
7237 : Really? I thought you were a newcomer, the way you dress and talk...
7238 : Well, I've gotta go. I have to find a way to get outside these walls!
7239 : Phew... She's finally gone.
7240 : Why won't we let her go outside, you ask? Oh, you'll find out soon enough.
7241 : So, you're new in Bastok, huh? What are you thinking of doing first?
7242 : What do you want to do? Fight monsters! Go shopping. Find some work.
7243 : Hey, not so fast! It's dangerous out there! Well, if you really want to go outside, you can go back the way you came, through the gate. But don't come complaining to me if you get hurt.
7244 : If you do go, one piece of advice: check your target before fighting it, and only fight creatures you're sure you can beat. Got that?
7245 : Well, there are a few street vendors around...but if you want better stuff, you should go to the Markets District.
7246 : The stores there have a pretty good selection, but you don't look like you can afford to buy much from them now.
7247 : That's very vague. What kind of work are you looking for?
7248 : What do you want to do? Serve Bastok. Help people. Get rich, quick.
7249 : Ah, good! You've come to the right person. I'm the guard in charge of assigning missions--there's one of us at each gate. Since you seem so eager, I'll assign you one.
7250 : Don't worry, it's an easy one, even for a tenderfoot like you. All you have to do is collect a report from the overseer of the Zeruhn Mines.
7251 : Let me give you the directions: Cross the bridge southwest of here and go to the Bastok Markets. Once there, head south, and you'll be in the Mines District. The Zeruhn Mines are in the western section.
7252 : Did you get all that? If you get lost, just ask people along the way.
7253 : Ah, that's very commendable! There aren't enough people like you these days.
7254 : Why don't you start by helping that girl who was here earlier?
7255 : She's been frequently seen going to the Tenshodo warehouse west of here. I hope she doesn't get into trouble with them.
7256 : Money, huh? You might want to try the Steaming Sheep Restaurant, a tavern that caters to all sorts. One of their patrons might know something useful.
7257 : The tavern's a little ways west of here. You can't miss it.
7258 : Oh, and take this %. Bring it to Dulsie. You can find her in front of the drawbridge. She'll help you out.
7259 : The drawbridge is right over there. Here, on your map.
7260 : And this is where Dulsie is. Open the Map from the main menu on the right if you want to check it again.
7261 : Remember, if you want to give an item to someone, use Trade from the main menu.
7262 : That's it. I guess I'll be seeing you around!
7263 : Hey there! Let me guess, you're an adventurer, right?
7264 : I bet you came here looking for some high-paying work. Am I right again?
7265 : Well, it's not a bad idea, but you're out of luck. I personally haven't heard anything worthwhile lately.
7266 : Let me ask around, though--hey, Carmelo! You used to be an adventurer, right? Heard anything lately?
7267 : Oh yeah, what about that % job you told me about?
7268 : Friendly guy, huh? Anyway, the story is, he brought a thing called a % back to Wahid, the gem collector, and got paid a huge bag of gil!
7269 : Carmelo said he just found it on the shore of a river somewhere, too!
7270 : Go over and talk to him if you want to know more.
7271 : You came to ask me about the %, yes?
7272 : Ask about %? Yes. No.
7273 : Memories of the deep, like ephemeral dew, A flickering light on the shores of dust, Suddenly gone in the whispering blue, The wrathful hand broke the sirens' trust.
7274 : ...Ah, my apologies. You came not here to listen to my word-weaving.
7275 : This saying you must remember: Sirens shun the eager warrior.
7276 : When you find the gem, if you still bear arms with hostile intent...
7277 : The % will escape your grasp and flow down the river once more.
7278 : Even for a moment, you must put away all tools of war and show your true self to the sirens of Gustaberg.
7279 : As for myself... My tear I let go for a bagful of gil, A part of me ended, and it pains me still.
7280 : ...I pray your tear gives you a new beginning.
7281 : What? You want to get rich? Hah! If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't be here now, would I?
7282 : And once again, % floats down the river, seeking shelter from the tides of war...
7283 : I don't know why grown-ups say that this place is useless.
7284 : It's loads of fun! Grown-ups don't know what they're missing!
7285 : <Sigh> What am I to do...?
7286 : I'm sick and tired of entertaining guests.
7287 : What am I to do... Hmm? You want to help me? Good! I was waiting for someone to offer!
7288 : I have a guest coming in from Jeuno. Since we've never met before, I thought I should hold something noticeable so he could find me...but I might have chosen something a little too bizarre.
7289 : I told him I'd bring %, but I realized later I don't even own %! Whatever possessed me to tell him that?
7290 : I'm busy preparing his welcoming feast, so I'd like you to find % and meet him at the air travel agency in my place. And when you find him--rather, when he finds you--bring him to me. Can you do it?
7291 : Go greet Powhatan's guest in his place? Yes. No.
7292 : Good, good! My guest's name is Evrain. He's a young Hume white mage. To work, then, to work!
7293 : You won't go? Ah, then what am I to do...?
7294 : Hmm? Yes? Was there something you didn't understand?
7295 : What do you want to ask him? Where can I find %? Where am I supposed to meet your guest? Nothing.
7296 : I've heard someone say some Quadav wear % sometimes...does that help?
7297 : You can't find him? He should be coming through the arrival gate of the air travel agency...
7298 : If he's not there, you might want to ask the receptionist at the counter. His flight may have been delayed.
7299 : Ah, you're back! Thanks to you, I was able to meet Mister Evrain! Here, take this as a token of my gratitude.
7300 : What am I to do... Hmm? You want to help me? Ah, it's you again! Good, I was waiting for you to offer!
7301 : I'm expecting another guest from Jeuno--and I've done it again! I told him I'd be holding the most bizarre thing...
7302 : I said I'd be holding %! I don't even own %! Now, whatever possessed me to say that?
7303 : I'm busy preparing his welcoming feast, so...I'd like you to find % and meet him at the air travel agency in my place. And when you find him--rather, when he finds you--bring him to me. Can you do it?
7304 : Go greet Powhatan's guest in his place? Yes. No.
7305 : Good, good! My guest's name is Domien. He's an Elvaan knight. To work, then, to work!
7306 : You won't go? The last time was enough for you? I'm sorry to hear that... What am I to do, then?
7307 : Hmm? Yes? Something you didn't understand?
7308 : What do you want to ask him? Where can I find %? Where am I supposed to meet your guest? Nothing.
7309 : To tell you the truth, I don't know. But I've heard of % many times before, so it shouldn't be an uncommon item. That's probably why I told Sir Domien I'd be holding one!
7310 : You can't find him? Oh, no! He must've already arrived! He's probably wandering, lost, and trying to find me!
7311 : Please go find him! He should still be in this district, but if he's wandered off to the Bastok Markets, ask the guards there if they've seen him!
7312 : Ah, you're back! Where is Sir Domien? What!? He gave you this letter and left in a fury!?
7313 : Oh, no! What am I to do? ...Still, you've done what I've asked you to do, and I feel I still owe you for the last time. Here, take this.
7314 : What's a tenderfoot like you doing here? Get lost!
7315 : The beastmen are on the rise again...and that means our profits are rising, too. Heh-heh.
7316 : Did you just ask me what we are doing here? You don't even know that? Who the hell let you in? Get out!
7317 : Oh, you again. If you find any more of those %--say, four more of them--bring them here. I'll give you a good price for them. Deal?
7318 : Good, you brought the % I asked for. Here's your money.
7319 : Hmm? What's a rookie like you doing in here?
7320 : Hey!
7321 : Oh, no. Not you again...
7322 : Parraggoh's already given you three out of the four you asked for! Why aren't you giving him his reward!?
7323 : As I've said, business is business. Nothing personal.
7324 : There's only one of these, and I can't give it to him unless he brings me the four he promised me. If you want to help him, go and bring me the last one.
7325 : I told you I can't!
7326 : Hey, haven't I seen you somewhere...
7327 : I remember now, you're the adventurer! Can I ask you a favor?
7328 : Hey, you look like...you're an adventurer, right? Can I ask you a favor?
7329 : Can you go get me %? I've heard that monsters in Gustaberg drop them.
7330 : Go find % for her? Yes. No.
7331 : Thanks! Talib, this person will bring you the last one, okay?
7332 : All right, that's fine by me. I don't know why anyone would bother helping a Galka, but...it's your life.
7333 : Thanks! I'll see you!
7334 : Oh, come on! Please?
7335 : Fine! I'll go ask someone else--someone who's not so selfish!
7336 : That feisty girl, Cornelia? I hear she hangs out in the Mines District, where all the Galka are. Why anyone would is beyond me.
7337 : Parraggoh lives there, by the way. When he got hurt and couldn't deliver the goods to us, she must've volunteered herself to help out. She's like that.
7338 : Parraggoh's place is the first house down through the big arch to the mining town. It's a rough neighborhood, but Cornelia won't stay out of there.
7339 : Hey, %! I can't believe you'd do this for a guy like Parraggoh.
7340 : More people like you and Cornelia, and I'd be out of business...
7341 : Here, take these % to Parraggoh. They're the reward he asked for.
7342 : You know where he lives, right? It's the first house you see when you go down to the lower level of the Mines District.
7343 : May I help you?  ...A white mage named Evrain? No, I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen him.
7344 : That %... You must be Mister Powhatan.
7345 : No? You've come in his place? Mister Powhatan is in the tavern, you say?
7346 : He shouldn't have gone through all this trouble for me, you know. I've been to Bastok before.
7347 : I'll go meet him in the tavern, then. Don't worry, I know the way.
7348 : The client sent an invalid value to the server!
7349 : You cannot receive mission assignments at this time.
7350 : I am in charge of assigning missions, but I am only allowed to do so to those whose allegiance is to Bastok.
7351 : You cannot undertake two missions at the same time. Finish the one you are on now before asking for a new one.
7352 : Missions currently available are as follows:
7353 : Which mission will you undertake? The Zeruhn Report. A Geological Survey. Fetichism. The Crystal Line. Wading Beasts. The Emissary. 2-3-1A. 2-3-1B. 2-3-2A. 2-3-2B. The Four Musketeers. To the Forsaken Mines. Jeuno. . Darkness Rising. Xarcabard, Land of Truths. Return of the Talekeeper. The Pirates' Cove. The Final Image. On My Way. The Chains That Bind Us. Enter the Talekeeper. The Salt of the Earth. Where Two Paths Converge. . . . . . . . None.
7354 : I am in charge of assigning missions to Bastokers who wish to serve their country. Are you one of them?
7355 : Have you come to undertake a mission? Yes, I have. No, maybe later.
7356 : Will you accept this mission? Yes. No.
7357 : You have accepted the mission.
7358 : Then move along.
7359 : Good. This is your first time going on a mission, is it not?
7360 : Your first assignment is not a difficult one. The details are as follows:
7361 : You must go to the Zeruhn Mines in the western section of the Mines District. Once there, you are to collect a report from the overseer.
7362 : You can consult the Mission section of the main menu to review your objectives. Speed and efficiency are your priorities. Dismissed.
7363 : The Chief Engineer is conducting new research, and has asked for someone to assist him. He can be found in the Metalworks, to the east of the administrative section.
7364 : The Chief Engineer's laboratory is on the second floor of the Metalworks. You don't know his name!? And you call yourself a Bastoker!
7365 : The Chief Engineer's name is Cid. Any Bastoker would know that! Now go and see him. He will give you the details of your mission.
7366 : The Palborough Mines, once our main source of mythril, have been under beastman control for some time.
7367 : We want you to hunt these beastmen, the Quadav, and bring back %, %, %, and % as proof of your accomplishments.
7368 : You must present all four items to me or one of my colleagues in order to complete this mission.
7369 : Good, you've brought all four parts of the doll.
7370 : I am raising your rank to 2 for completing this mission. Congratulations.
7371 : If you've been to the Palborough Mines, you must know now the serious nature of the threat these beastmen pose to our civilization.
7372 : As a Bastoker, you are expected to take on more missions and go on conquests to preserve Bastok's brilliant future!
7373 : But I cannot give you a new mission at this time.
7374 : You need to collect rank points before taking on new missions.
7375 : You can receive rank points by participating in conquests and donating the crystals you acquire to guards, or by undertaking missions you've previously completed.
7376 : Ask the High Guard near the gatehouse if you wish to hear more about conquests.
7377 : Have you heard of a strange structure called the Crag of Dem? It is on the Konschtat Highlands, north of the Gustaberg Mountains.
7378 : They say that crystals are drained of their power if you take them to a certain section of that structure.
7379 : Chief Cid is currently investigating this strange phenomenon, and is asking for someone to bring back a faded crystal.
7380 : Go see him for a more detailed explanation of your objectives.
7381 : You want a crystal to use for this experiment? Are you not an adventurer? It should be easy for you to procure one.
7382 : You are to collect % from beasts in the Dangruf Wadi.
7383 : Senator Alois is in need of some. Do not ask me why. He can be found in the President's Office.
7384 : You've acquired quite a reputation. There is a new mission for you to tackle.
7385 : First, speak to Sir Naji of the Mythril Musketeers at the President's Office. This mission is of great import to the welfare of our nation.
7386 : I see you've made it back safely from your journey to Windurst and San d'Oria. This new mission should not be hard for an experienced adventurer like you.
7387 : The Mythril Musketeers are planning an offensive on the Quadav stronghold.
7388 : Adventurers, including yourself, have been asked to join them on this operation.
7389 : You are to go meet Iron Eater, one of the Mythril Musketeers, to receive a full briefing.
7390 : The Gusgen Mines in the Konschtat Highlands have been dug to the bare rock and abandoned for some time...
7391 : But lately, there have been reports that a rare ore can be found in them. No one has claimed this new vein yet.
7392 : You are to bring back a sample of the ore to confirm these reports. A Galka adventurer named Davyad should be able to help you. He is said to have acquired a chunk of the ore when he was there last.
7393 : The item that Davyad brought back was %. That is what you should seek as well. Once you have the ore, hand them over to me or one of my colleagues.
7394 : You have succeeded in bringing back %. Good work, adventurer. This discovery may help rejuvenate Bastok's economy!
7395 : You have heard of Jeuno, have you not? The Bastokan government is currently looking for someone to send there, and your name is on the list of candidates.
7396 : The presidential aide, Sir Lucius himself, recommended you. It is a great honor--you should be proud!
7397 : Sir Lucius wishes to see you as soon as possible. Go meet him in his office in the administrative section at the top of the Metalworks.
7398 : I have orders for you from the president himself. You must have heard already, but he wants you to go to Fei'Yin.
7399 : Go speak to Sir Naji at the President's Office. He will show you in.
7400 : So, it has finally come to this... You are to infiltrate the Kindred's main stronghold of Zvahl.
7401 : The president will brief you himself in his office. Good luck, adventurer!
7402 : Ah, you have returned from Jeuno. Go to the President's Office right away. Sir Naji will show you in.
7403 : Take it from me, a guard's job is pretty boring. Not that I'd rather have trouble, mind you.
7404 : The North Gate and Beligen Square are down these stairs. Cross the drawbridge from the square if you want to get to the residential area.
7405 : Go straight west and you'll come across a goods store and the tavern. Further west is the road leading to the Markets District.
7406 : The residential area is on the other side of this drawbridge. Cross it while it's down if you need to go to your Mog House.
7407 : Incoming ship! Everyone off the bridge!
7408 : I'm helping Evelyn with her store. She said she'd give me a present if I worked hard!
7409 : You lost? Where you goin'?
7410 : Which area do you want to ask about? None. The western section. The eastern section.
7411 : All-righty. Come back anytime. Have a nice day.
7412 : All right, let's see... See all those doors to the west, there?
7413 : The ones on the right are your run-of-the-mill warehouses. Some real shady characters've been seen going in there, so you be careful, all right?
7414 : On the left you've got the air travel agency, or the door to the world, as they say. You need an airship pass to get in, though. And not through that door, either--that's the exit. Heh-heh.
7415 : The entrance is around the corner. Once you're in, you gotta walk down to the pier to get on airships.
7416 : Airships there only go to Jeuno--but of course, you knew that, right?
7417 : A little further on, we have Galvin's Travel Gear--a goods shop. They've got a few things adventurers like yourself might need.
7418 : Above Galvin's, you've got the Steaming Sheep Restaurant, which most people just call the tavern. It's a good place if you want to eat, drink, or hear a good story or two.
7419 : And further down west...you'll come to a bridge. It leads to the Markets District, a nicer part of town.
7420 : You can get to both the Metalworks and the Mines District from the markets. It's like the crossroads of Bastok, if you know what I mean.
7421 : Okay, to the east--we've got a few houses on the left, a few merchant stalls on the right...
7422 : Oh, those merchants don't have much to sell, by the way. They're only useful if you want to sell off stuff you don't need and go back outside right away.
7423 : Right, further on down the stairs is...the North Gate!
7424 : You can get missions from the guards there or ask to join in conquests.
7425 : Just south of the square is one of our major landmarks, the drawbridge!
7426 : It's gotta be drawn up when airships come in, so be careful. The residential area on the other side is where your room is. Go there if you need to store stuff.
7427 : Oh, but you have to be a Bastoker or have a Rent-a-Room to do that.
7428 : That's about it. Come back if you have any more questions, all right?
7429 : This building here is where you get on airships. I'm usually here all day, so I hear a lot of stories about things happening in other countries.
7430 : Traveling on airships is a right only given to those who've proven themselves worthy. It's still a little early for you, I would think.
7431 : I am from San d'Oria. Have you ever gone there? You do not want to. It is a nation trapped in old traditions and foolish rules.
7432 : The San d'Orian army is thought the mightiest in Vana'diel, but it is only a shadow of its past self.
7433 : I chose to let my soul be ravaged by the cruel wheel of time rather than spend an eternity in that timeless city. Here, at least, I feel alive.
7434 : Rafaela and I love taking walks along this road. The sea wind seeps deep and soothes the soul. Do you feel it as well?
7435 : Bastok's sea is the same shade of blue as the one near San d'Oria. They are one and the same. I do not long for my homeland anymore...I have Rafaela, now.
7436 : Sometimes, as we look at the sea together, Evi gets this real sad look on his face...
7437 : And I think, maybe he was never meant to be one of us, and that he should not stay here in Bastok.
7438 : Are you looking for something? There is nothing here you would want.
7439 : If you are looking for my daughter Ayame, she is working at the President's Office. She does not come back home often.
7440 : Everyone says that they're all proud of sis.
7441 : I am, too--she's strong, cool, and smart. I'm not any of those...I can never be like her.
7442 : The Humes were planning on raising a new building here.
7443 : But when the Hume head engineer switched departments, they canceled the whole project, leaving us out to dry. I hate Hume bureaucracy.
7444 : There's nothing to see here. Just another forgotten Hume project, where we Galka did all the work and were left with nothing to show for our sweat and toil.
7445 : It's a great day, isn't it? Bastok has changed. There's that drawbridge there, and airships in the air... But the sun still shines as brightly as when we were children.
7446 : This used to be the secret place where young lovers met. Qiji and I used to come here, too, before we moved in together.
7447 : People say the drawbridge is getting old, but it looks as sturdy to me as the first time I laid eyes on it. If anything has changed, it must be something within us...
7448 : I'm happy that my granddaughter likes me, but I must say I have trouble keeping up with her at my age.
7449 : C'mon, Grandma! Over here!
7450 : I don't know what's wrong with my son. He stays home all day and does nothing. I wish there were something I could do.
7451 : Leave me alone! I don't wanna go outside! I'm safe here...no one can hurt me...
7452 : It pays better to work for the Humes in this district than to dig in the mines.
7453 : Those good-for-nothing hard-heads in the Mines District don't know what they're missing.
7454 : Can I help you? No, you can't store personal items here. Our space is rented out to major trading companies and ministries of the government.
7455 : I've seen some real shady characters going into the warehouse next door. I wonder what kind of business they're in? Actually, never mind. I don't want to know.
7456 : We came all the way here from Windurst hoping to make some quick gil, but business has been rrreally slow...almost as slow as Panana's Cures.
7457 : I really don't like fighting, but Konty here takes us to dangerous places all the time!
7458 : Why did I ever agree to leave Windurst? I wanna go home... <Sigh>
7459 : Hey, you a rookie? If I were you, I'd go hunt lizards. They're worth the trouble--take my word for it.
7460 : Cross this bridge to go to the Markets District. Also take this road to get to the Metalworks--which include forges and administrative buildings--and the Mines District.
7461 : An Elvaan knight named Domien?
7462 : Yes, I believe I've seen someone matching that description walk by earlier...wait, is that him?
7463 : That %...are you Powhatan?
7464 : You're his representative? No matter--you should know that being late to a meeting is rude, not to say unforgivable, where I am from.
7465 : I have written a letter of complaint to Mister Powhatan. Give it to him--I am going back to Jeuno. Goodbye.
7466 : What's wrong with me? I'm too scared to go outside...I want to hide in a small, narrow place...
7467 : I need something big enough to hide my whole body! Do you have something like that? Can you find one for me? Please?
7468 : Yes, yes! This is great! Finally, I can sleep in peace! I'm never going out again! Hah hah!
7469 : Ah, it's you! That shell you gave me is great! I must've been a turtle in a past life!
7470 : You! You're the one who gave my son that cursed thing, aren't you!?
7471 : Thanks to you, not only does he never go out, he stays in that shell all day!
7472 : Do something! Isn't there anything you can do to make him come out of his shell?
7473 : It's your fault, Panana! I knew I shouldn't have let you talk me into going to Beadeaux! Now I've got these itchy bugs all over me!
7474 : That's not my fault! I did warn you about looking for treasure-pleasure inside Quadav shells!
7475 : Everyone knows they're full of %! You have to be careful when you touch them!
7476 : Don't you know the saying, putting % in a Quadav shell? It means, stirring up trouble!
7477 : What is this? Ah, of course! Putting % in a Quadav shell! All I have to do is put this nasty little thing in my son's shell, right?
7478 : I'll go do it right away! Come back later--I'll give you a reward if it works!
7479 : My shell became really itchy all of a sudden...
7480 : Now I wonder why I wanted to hide in that thing in the first place...
7481 : Oh, there you are! That trick of yours worked! Now, if only my son would go out... Anyway, here's something for your trouble.
7482 : I'm telling you, it's those Quadav. They must've put some kind of curse on him!
7483 : My neighbor Ensetsu's daughter, Ayame, is quite a remarkable girl. Have you met her yet?
7484 : She's always been very bright. She became a samurai when she was little, and now she made it to the top and became a Mythril Musketeer!
7485 : Only the top five Musketeers can join their ranks, you know. Ensetsu must be proud that Ayame was chosen to be one!
7486 : Now, if only her sister Kaede were a little more like her. She's so quiet and unremarkable...but I suppose children should be seen and not heard.
7487 : I never see much of Corann... Oh, that's the son of my neighbor Ronan. I think he stays cooped up in his room all day.
7488 : He's like a turtle in its shell... So much so that some people even say that the turtle people cast a curse on him when he was born!
7489 : The tavern's up these steps. The goods shop and the bridge leading to the Markets District is straight to the west.
7490 : To the east is the North Gate and the drawbridge leading to the residential area. That's about it.
7491 : I started working for the air travel agency hoping to become an airship pilot someday, but all they make me do is move boxes and crates.
7492 : Maybe I should've gone to Jeuno instead. Jeuno is where all the airships go, you know? Like that saying, All routes lead to Jeuno, or something like that.
7493 : Due to technical difficulties, we cannot issue World Passes at this time.
7494 : This is where we issue World Passes. A World Pass allows you to invite people from other worlds to join you.
7495 : Your World Pass is: %.
7496 : Be warned that you can only invite a limited number of people to this world with your World Pass.
7497 : This is such a great location... I wish the Humes hadn't dropped the whole project.
7498 : You should've seen us when the foreman was still here! We were busy like bees, but happy as lambs to take part in this big project. But look at us now.
7499 : The foreman took it the hardest. He disappeared when the project was canceled. I think his dog went with him, too.
7500 : I wonder what happened to him? It's still a little too early for him to have left on his journey of rebirth...
7501 : Say, you're an adventurer, aren't you? Can you tell me if you hear anything about our foreman or his dog?
7502 : The foreman told me not to tell anyone, but he said he was going to the big hill in North Gustaberg.
7503 : He told me that he'd be gone for a while, so he asked me to take care of his dog for him while he was away.
7504 : But the day after the foreman left, his dog disappeared, too. I hope they're both all right...
7505 : Hey...the foreman's dog used to wear this collar. What would an undead cur--in North Gustaberg, of all places--be doing with it?
7506 : Some say that when you die, the regret you have about things you left undone could turn you into an undead, but...is this possible?
7507 : If that was the foreman's dog you fought, then that would mean the foreman is also...
7508 : No, he cannot be. He must have already reincarnated into a new body. He used to say that this project might be his last job...
7509 : I just wish we could've finished it, for the foreman's sake.
7510 : In any case, I should thank you for this bit of news, be it good or ill. Here, take this. It isn't much, but it should come in handy.
7511 : The stamp hunt, right? Yes, you're not the first adventurer who has come to me asking for it. Here you go.
7512 : You received a stamp!
7513 : Hunting what? Oh, stamps. Right, I'm supposed to give those out, too. Here.
7514 : I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking out for here. Sure, there are those griping Galka at the construction site and shady dealings in the warehouses, but those are nothing new.
7515 : I need a favor. I want to give my wife Romilda here a present.
7516 : % should do nicely...could you go get me one?
7517 : Oh! The %! But I'm a little too embarrassed to give it to her myself...could you do it for me?
7518 : My! %, for me? Why, that's very nice of you!
7519 : Qiji, look at what this nice person gave me! And you haven't given me a present in ages! Shame on you!
7520 : B-but, that's--
7521 : Thank you very much! I've wanted one of these for the longest time. It's as if you read my mind!
7522 : Uh...
7523 : Well, as long as she's happy, I can't complain. Here's something for your trouble.
7524 : Yes? Of course I know that present was from my husband, dear. He thinks I'm hard of hearing, but he's the one who can't even hear himself talk!
7525 : In fact, this isn't the first time he's done this. But you know what? It's a wonderful thing to receive a gift from someone who loves you, no matter how many times, or how old you are.
7526 : I should give Qiji something back for his present this time, too. Would you be kind enough to go find me %, dear?
7527 : Oh, and don't worry, I can give them to him myself. Men are such cowards!
7528 : Ah, you've brought them. Thank you. Here's something for you.
7529 : Hmm? You! What are you giving her? Is that some present from another man!?
7530 : Oh, don't be foolish, Qiji. This nice person just brought me what I asked for--a present from me to you. Here.
7531 : Present? Oh! %! Of course you would! You never could resist my charms! <Wink, wink> Heh-heh.
7532 : Yes, yes... Ah, here, take this. Thank you again.
7533 : Oh, and...one more thing. Seeing or hearing things the same way isn't important. Sharing the same moments in your life is.
7534 : Qiji told me that when he proposed to me. I'd like to think that's why we're still together.
7535 : I must ask you to do something for me. You see, I was once a knight of San d'Oria. I left the Order and came here, to Bastok, when I realized the futility of their ways.
7536 : On my way here, I buried my mission orders for that day near the windmills in Konschtat. It was a dishonorable thing to do, and I regret doing it now...
7537 : Evi? You're not going back, are you?
7538 : Do not worry, Rafaela, I am not. That paper is a testament to my past failures... I just wish to rip it apart with my own hands, and finally start anew.
7539 : If you happen to go to the Konschtat Highlands, would you try retrieving it for me? Unfortunately, I cannot remember which windmill I buried it near...
7540 : Yes, this is it. Finally, I may start anew. Take this as a token of my gratitude. I do not need it anymore.
7541 : Ah, I wish I had time to chat, but I'm a little busy at the moment.
7542 : I am the owner of this establishment, but I have yet to get used to doing all these chores...
7543 : Yes? If there's anything you can do to help? Well, we're running a little low on salt, and I'm having trouble with the bookkeeping, and...
7544 : Oh, it's no use. I've been trying to manage this restaurant ever since my husband died twenty years ago, but I still can't do anything properly...
7545 : The other day, a customer ordered %, but I haven't been able to get any.
7546 : He was a regular customer when my husband ran this place, so I wish I could serve him the next time he comes in.
7547 : Isn't this...? Yes, it is %! Thank you so much! Oh! I should pay you for your trouble...
7548 : You were asked to help me? But who would...? The Chief Engineer himself?
7549 : I see... Let us go upstairs--there are a few things I should tell you.
7550 : Chief Cid was a close friend of my husband's. He was the one who gave my husband his job in the Palborough Mines. Digging mythril there earned him enough gil to open this restaurant.
7551 : Then, twenty years ago, they discovered a new vein of mythril in the Palborough Mines, and my husband, though long retired by then, was called in to oversee the diggings.
7552 : Things were going smoothly until...a batch of the new type of explosives they were using went off without warning, and as if waiting for such an opportunity, the Quadav attacked.
7553 : You must have guessed by now--Chief Engineer Cid was the one who designed the formula for the new explosive.
7554 : I would be lying if I said I never blamed Cid for my husband's death...even though my husband would surely have forgiven him.
7555 : Give this letter to Cid for me. Tell him he doesn't have to worry about me, or this restaurant.
7556 : Ah, it's you. That customer I told you about came back, and I was able to serve him % this time, thanks to you.
7557 : He said he used to work with my husband in the Metalworks before he retired.
7558 : He wanted to have % the next time he comes, but I don't know where to get one...
7559 : Oh, my! Wherever did you find this? Thank you, you've saved me again! I must tell that customer to come back...
7560 : Oh, but I forgot to ask him his name! He said he still worked in the Metalworks...
7561 : He said he used to work with my husband there. He's a Galka, very reserved but polite. Do you know him?
7562 : If you do see him, could you give him this letter of invitation for me?
7563 : Did you give my letter to my customer? You did? Thank you. You say his name is Raibaht?
7564 : He works in Cid's lab as the Chief Engineer's aide? Now that you mention it, I do remember hearing his name before...
7565 : Oh!
7566 : Thank you for your invitation, Ms. Hilda. I must apologize for my lack of manners for ordering dishes and not even leaving my name.
7567 : Please, Mister Raibaht, come this way.
7568 : Your husband and I were hired the same year by the Metalworks Department of Mining. But we were never on good terms, to say the least.
7569 : Then why...?
7570 : Most Humes only think of us as big brutes...but your husband was the only one to see me, a Galka, as someone worthy enough to be his rival.
7571 : The other Humes did not even consider me capable of being a scientist. Your husband, though, would come to me every time he made a breakthrough...and brag.
7572 : You may laugh, but I cannot explain how happy I was that he would come to me, and no one else.
7573 : Yes, my husband was like that. He was outspoken, honest about his feelings, even childish in some ways. His wanting to open this restaurant, for example...
7574 : Yes. I was dismayed at first when he decided to retire, but after seeing this place...I understand why.
7575 : When did you decide to work for the Chief Engineer? I didn't think his kind of work was in your field of expertise.
7576 : Your husband used to tell me about him. When I learned that it was his invention that caused your husband's demise, I decided to approach him, without revealing my true intents.
7577 : What were you thinking of doing!?
7578 : I wanted to see what kind of man could live with the death of so many on his conscience...but I have yet to understand him fully. He is more complex than any equation I've had to solve.
7579 : But do not worry, madam--vengeance is long gone from my mind. I understand now why your husband was so fond of him. He and Cid are very much alike.
7580 : Yes...I know.
7581 : I will study Cid's work, and when I understand it fully, I will pass that knowledge down to future generations.
7582 : That is what your husband would have wanted me to do. I know that now.
7583 : These doors lead to the airship embarkation area. You need % and # gil to pass through.
7584 : Only departing passengers may pass through these doors. Please go around to the entrance on the south side.
7585 : Those doors lead to the airship embarkation area. You must pay # gil to pass through.
7586 : Pay # gil? Yes. No.
7587 : You can't get out to the pier this way. Only arriving passengers may go through these doors. Please go around to the entrance on the west side.
7588 : If you enter Bastok, you must pay again to board the airship. Would you like to proceed?
7589 : Go in? Yes. No.
7590 : Debug - Distance: #
7591 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Gustaberg, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
7592 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Zulkheim, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
7593 : Sorry, I don't have anything to sell you. I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Derfland, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
7594 : I'm trying to start a business selling goods from Kuzotz, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan control.
7595 : Ladies and gentlefolk, welcome to the Troupe Valeriano show! We are delighted to perform for Bastok, with its indescribable fame and unfathomably deep pockets!
7596 : Welcome to the Troupe Valeriano. Valeriano, at your service! Have a laugh, then spend some cash! Treats and sweets from exotic lands!
7597 : You guys must've worked real hard. Bastok is a much nicer place now than when I left it. I wish I could go back to bashing monsters again, like in the old days.
7598 : How do you like Bastok? It's my hometown, you know! Sure, there are still some...unsightly elements, but it's still the best city in the world!
7599 : The music store here sells really good instruments! Shh, don't tell the boss...but I'm gonna-wanna sneak off and go there later.
7600 : There are plenty of bards around, but I'm the best harpist in Vana'diel. You don't believe me? Then stay awhile and listen.
7601 : The food here's terrrible! C'mon, Windurrrstians, work harder! I miss Windurstian cuisine!
7602 : Like to see my new knife trrrick? Good, but keep your distance if you value your various extremities and bodily protrusions!
7603 : This place...is tiring...
7604 : ... (I'm a mime.)
7605 : Do I like airships? Are you crazy!? They're a menace!
7606 : I hear that every time an airship passes overhead, a terrible beast appears and destroys everything!
7607 : It's true! The monster was sighted on the Rolanberry Fields! Please...I need to convince people that airships are dangerous. I need to get my hands on whatever that monster drops--that way, I can prove it to them!
7608 : You got it! Magnificent! But wasn't the beast horrible, as I said it would be? There's no time to waste. Now that I have proof, I have to warn everyone about the airship menace!!!
7609 : Oh, and here. Take this.
7610 : Oh, you again. What? Airships are scary? What are you talking about? They're the most marvelous things on earth...er, I mean, in the sky.
7611 : Airships bring the most delicious things I've ever tasted! Remember the % you brought back? It was great!
7612 : Why am I here? To watch those majestic airships cut through the clouds, of course!
7613 : Take my word for it, housework is not easy. Especially clearing clogged chimneys--that takes up a whole day!
7614 : Hmm... I remember my mother-in-law telling me there was an item that cleared chimneys in a flash, but what was it, I wonder? Do you know?
7615 : Yes, can I help you? You have a clogged chimney? I say, adventurers really do have a lot cut out for them, what with defeating monsters, and doing housework...
7616 : You need %. Put some in your chimney and light a fire, then boom! Your troubles are gone.
7617 : I keep telling my daughter-in-law about it, but young people these days never listen to what their elders tell them.
7618 : Is this it? This can clear chimneys? My mother-in-law said so?
7619 : Hmm...I guess I faintly remember her talking about it. Oh well, as long as it works. Here's something for your trouble.
7620 : Ah! An adventurer! And I see you've also earned your %! I need your help!
7621 : You see, these words have been bothering me for some time: Under a full moon, toward the stars of Ifrit, a bird brings a letter to the ship in the sky.
7622 : I don't remember where I heard it. I woke up this morning with those words...and a whopping headache...as the only clues to where I was last night.
7623 : Could you try finding this letter for me? I fancy it might be a clue that leads to great treasure! What? Yes, of course, I will give you a share!
7624 : A ship that flies toward the stars of Ifrit? Interesting imagery, but I've written better prose in my sleep.
7625 : Ah! Let me see! Let me see! What? It's just a wishy-washy love letter. What's it doing on an airship?
7626 : Here, take it back. It gives me the creeps! Oh, and here's something for you. Now, go away!
7627 : My name, on some love letter? Are you sure? There must be some mistake.
7628 : %... Yes, I am the one who wrote it. I have also been sending the birds, hoping she might get it.
7629 : I met her on the shores of the Gustaberg river. She was an adventurer, as I was in those days. She was...as beautiful as a siren.
7630 : We promised each other we would travel to the Northlands together someday. When we went, we would board the ship that flies toward the stars of Ifrit...
7631 : But in order to do that, I needed money. So I sold the % that had brought us together.
7632 : By letting it go, our bond was weakened. We started to slowly drift apart...and one day, she was gone.
7633 : I was hoping that she would board that airship to go to the Northlands someday, and find my letter waiting for her. It was a long shot, but I had to try.
7634 : I had written a song about the Northlands as well, but...this has gone on long enough. It is time to end it.
7635 : Have you ever been to the Mirror Pond, at the southeastern edge of the Beaucedine Glacier? She and I were supposed to go there together.
7636 : They say that when the snow stops falling and the pond freezes, even the lightest piece of parchment sinks slowly to the bottom. I want you to put this, the testament of our pledge, in that pond.
7637 : You're back... What!? You've seen her? What did she say!?
7638 : Yes, I would have sacrificed everything to be with her. Maybe I was trying to stop time...my time.
7639 : But the hands of the clock would break... I suppose she is right.
7640 : Thank you. I can see things more clearly now... I will keep my clock wound so that when I see her, our times will be the same. Here, take this as a token of my gratitude.
7641 : Hi, there. For here or to go?
7642 : Welcome to the Steaming Sheep. Would you like something to drink?
7643 : Hello. This concourse is for arriving passengers.
7644 : Hello. This concourse is for departing passengers.
7645 : Hello! Might I interest you in some specialty goods from Gustaberg?
7646 : Welcome to Galvin's Travel Gear! We do our best to get the best for only the best!
7647 : Hello, hello! Won't you buy something? I'll give you a rebate!
7648 : Welcome. I've got goods from Derfland. Interested?
7649 : Hello, hello! Everything I have is imported directly from Zulkheim!
7650 : Hello there. How about buying % to stay in touch with your friends?
7651 : Traveler! I am sure my wares will prove useful on your journey. Why don't you buy some?
7652 : Ah, interested in my wares, are you? You can only buy these in Bastok, my friend.
7653 : Have you ever been to Selbina? It's a harbor town a little way north of Bastok. Many adventurers go there to ride the ferry to Mhaura. You should go there someday.
7654 : I make a living trading goods with Selbina, you see. But lately, my shipments are having trouble reaching the place.
7655 : Apparently, an infestation of sand bats has been plaguing the trade route between Bastok and Selbina.
7656 : Say, could you do me a favor and beat those flying rats out of the way? If you bring me % as proof you did your job, I'll be more than happy to pay you!
7657 : I can't believe a bunch of filthy flying rodents are the cause of all my troubles...
7658 : Aha! You did it! Good work! Finally, I can get back to business!
7659 : The more I think about it, the more those sand bats infuriate me. If you bring me more trophies like this, I'll be happy to pay you!
7660 : Say, you look like a seasoned adventurer. What say you to taking on a Tenshodo job for a change?
7661 : If you succeed, I will give you %. Only veteran monks may use it, but even if you aren't one, you can still sell it for a heap of gil.
7662 : I only ask you to bring me % and % for it.
7663 : Where can you find them? If you're the kind of adventurer I think you are, you should have a pretty good idea. Just don't do anything I wouldn't...heh heh.
7664 : Incredible! You were able to defeat both of them!?  Here's the % I promised. You deserve it. I can't wait to see the faces of the guys at Jeuno headquarters when they hear about you!
7665 : Thank you very much for all of your help.
7666 : , a hero's story! The deeds of %, in all their glory

7744 : Oh, it's you, %. I've known you since you started off here in Bastok, but I never thought you'd come this far.

7761 : %? What is that, some kind of snail? Oh, that's your name. You must be a rookie adventurer, right?

7787 : A life without spirits takes the spirit out of life... That's what I say.
7788 : I finally found you, Mister Oggbi.
7789 : What's with all the racket? Can't an old man have a drink in peace? And who are you, anyway?
7790 : I heard about you from Degenhard in the Markets. He said that you were a master of the martial arts.
7791 : Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Cornelia.
7792 : Cor...nelia?
7793 : Yes...but not the Cornelia you know. That's why I came here. I would like you to tell me about her.
7794 : Then you're wasting your time. I have nothing to say regarding Cornelia, a good-for-nothing student who packed up and left Bastok without even informing her master...
7795 : I knew it! You were Cornelia's instructor!
7796 : Oh, quiet down. Just because you have the same name doesn't mean you have to go romping around, acting as feisty as she was.
7797 : So, missy, what's with your interest in the other Cornelia? Or, is it that you want to become one of my students?
7798 : It's not that...
7799 : Alright, I'll tell you one thing. When Cornelia said she wanted to become my pupil, I gave her this test--
7800 : I told her to go deep into the Gusgen Mines and look for a tiny hole. Using % will call forth the vicious Wandering Ghost.
7801 : Bring back the % that the beast leaves behind--that was the test I gave her.
7802 : Why would you give her such a difficult...
7803 : You there. You look like a well-polished monk. If you want any more information, go and complete that test I gave Cornelia.
7804 : ...?  That can't be %! There is no way you could have...
7805 : What!? You say you got this after defeating a wandering ghost!?
7806 : No... She could have lost her life in those mines... If she had been killed...
7807 : The truth is, the test I gave Cornelia and you was just a joke. I never meant for anyone to actually go down there and battle any creatures.
7808 : Think about it. I gave that quest to Cornelia over thirty years ago. Mining in Palborough had begun to take off, but the Gusgen Mines...
7809 : The Gusgen Mines were still filled with hundreds of workers.
7810 : You senile old man! I can't believe you made me do that! There are no ghosts in the Gusgen Mines!
7811 : Oh! I never thought you'd actually go down into the mines! But what I told you was no lie.
7812 : You're right it wasn't a lie. I met some Galka down there named Wandering Ghost. Was that supposed to be funny or something!?
7813 : I never said that Wandering Ghost was an actual ghost, did I?
7814 : Whatever! Here's the % you asked for, old man.
7815 : What...? How were you--a simple Hume girl--able to get this % from a hard-headed Galka like Wandering Ghost...
7816 : Tell me about it! I would rather have taken my chances with a real wandering ghost than with that Galka! He wouldn't give me what you asked for until I brought him a hundred chunks of ore.
7817 : I spent the last three days and three nights trapped up in that miserable mine so I could pass your test--which turns out to be a big joke. Now it's time for you to hold up your end of the bargain!
7818 : I still can't believe that you would...
7819 : Enough! I need... I need to be stronger.
7820 : Wandering Ghost is the name Humes gave to one of my more infamous companions.
7821 : This % is a reminder of the time we spent together. If you don't mind, I'd like to keep it. Tonight, I'll drink to my lost friend. May his soul rest in peace!
7822 : I'd like to give you something for your trouble. I think you might be able to put this to good use.
7823 : I remember you. You're that young adventurer who came by before. You always bring someone along with you, don't you?
7824 : Greetings, Master Oggbi. I see you have returned to Bastok. My name is Michea. Do you recall our previous meeting?
7825 : Yes, I remember. You're the little girl who was always hiding behind Dalzakk. You've grown...
7826 : I would like to inquire about Dalzakk.
7827 : Is something wrong? Knowing him, he's probably off on some adventure again.
7828 : That's just it. He has not returned from his latest journey... Gwill is worried as well, although he will not show it.
7829 : Hmm... I remember him saying that he needed to travel to Fei'Yin on business.
7830 : Fei'Yin? What business would he have there...?
7831 : Well, I'm sorry to trouble you again, young adventurer, but could I ask you a favor?
7832 : Recently I asked Dalzakk to run an errand for me. If he's still in Fei'Yin, could you find him and ask him to pass that errand on to you?
7833 : I'm sure that Dalzakk could do it himself, but I think he should get back here as soon as possible...for Michea and Gwill's sake.
7834 : I apologize for asking you to do so much, but if it is not a burden...
7835 : You may think it strange coming from an old Galka like me, but it hurts me to see Michea this upset. Being the daughter of one of my pupils, I've always thought of her as my own granddaughter.
7836 : Ah. So you've gone to Davoi in Dalzakk's stead, then. What? Why all the trouble over a simple item such as this, you ask?
7837 : Do not worry too much of it. What is most important is that you have helped bring a little piece of happiness to a young Elvaan girl and a Galka boy.
7838 : It looks as if you have some free time. Will you sit down and have a drink with an old man? No, no. I won't ask you to go off on some adventure this time, but I'll reward you for just listening to my story.
7839 : It all has to do with %...
7840 : One day, long ago, my pupil Cornelia and I journeyed to San d'Oria together. We were hired by the San d'Orian abbey located in Davoi.
7841 : The Temple Knights have long been known for their skill with various weapons. However, the priests of San d'Oria, bound by their religious beliefs, spent their time refining their hand-to-hand fighting skills. One place this was practiced was in the abbey in Davoi.
7842 : In any event, a few scrolls containing some of the abbey's knowledge of martial arts were stolen by a band of Orcs in the Jugner Forest. Our job was to get those scrolls back.
7843 : The main reason I accepted this job was so I myself could learn of the hidden secrets of the San d'Orian monks. Nowadays, there are many who go around calling themselves monks, but few know that the currently practiced art combines Far Eastern tradition with San d'Orian techniques.
7844 : Now, where was I... Oh yes. We headed to the Orc stronghold, or should I say, the stronghold before Davoi was taken.
7845 : Master, are you sure we're looking in the right place?
7846 : We're having no luck, are we? If this keeps on, we'll be mistaken as burgla--
7847 : Sir...Sir Raogrimm?
7848 : Master Oggbi. What business have you here at the Orcs' stronghold?
7849 : We...we are just looking for...
7850 : Hey, you can't talk to my master like that! You make him sound like a common thief!
7851 : Oh, I see... You're that Talekeeper, Raogrimm. What's an admirable Musketeer like you doing in a dump like this?
7852 : An amusing pupil you have, Master Oggbi. Normally, a Hume girl would not even know the word Talekeeper.
7853 : Yeah, well, I know what I know.
7854 : Enough, Cornelia.
7855 : Little did he know they would soon meet again, as members of the Mythril Musketeers...
7856 : Oh, I apologize. I've been rambling on again. Here, take this. It is the same reward I gave Cornelia when she completed her quest.
7857 : The prrretty yellow rocks go round and round, Round and round, meow meow meow.
7858 : I want a rrrock that's nice and round, And a little yellow.
7859 : I wish that all of San d'Oria was full of pretty flowerrrs...
7860 : ...I wonder if everrrybody knows about garrrdening.
7861 : (Nobody knows the way to a girrrl's heart anymorrre...)
7862 : (Now, if only somebody came along with one of those rrred beauties...)
7863 : This is sooo cute...but members of the Star Onion Brrrigade are supposed to do only good deeds...but this is sooo cute.
7864 : Meooow... Wouldn't it be grrreat if my whole house was made of flowerrrs?
7865 : Tests...they're grrrrreat!
7866 : Reooow? You'rrre giving this to me?
7867 : Meooow... But this...meooow...
7868 : looks a little confused.
7869 : I only like prrretty flowerrrs and prrretty rocks. Don't need anything else.
7870 : Prrretty yellow rocks! That's what I'm collecting!
7871 : Wow! What a prrretty flowerrr! It smells sooo good!
7872 : Wow! What a prrretty rock! It's sooo smooth!
7873 : #! I'm sooo happy! Purrrrrr...

7875 : looks very happy.
7876 : Now, all my collection needs is %!
7877 : Anyway, thanks, [misterrr/miss]
7878 : Meooow! This is the one! This is the one!
7879 : This is the one I've wanted forrr my collection!
7880 : This one is grrreat, too! You got all these forrr me?
7881 : looks really happy.
7882 : looks really, REALLY happy.
7883 : You're the grrreatest!!
7884 : I can't give you anything in returrrn, but I can tell you my secrrret!
7885 : Come closerrr...
7886 : (Meow meow meow meow...)
7887 : (Meow meow meow meow...)
7888 : You have learned your way through the back alleys of Jeuno! Now you can exit to any area from your residence.
7889 : Heh-heh...
7890 : looks extremely happy.
7891 : Don't tell anybody I told you that! It'll be our little secrrret!
7892 : Wow! Thanks! My house is filled with prrretty flowers!
7893 : Wow! More yellow rocks! My house gets prrrettier every day!
7894 : But my moogle, my moogle is rrreally upset. She says we don't have any more space in my house!
7895 : You have no more room, kupo! Reooow... Give me a brrreak!
7896 : So, you can have that back! I guess I'll just have to give up on it this time. (Sigh)
7897 : Hee-hee. [Misterrr/Miss], I don't need this.
7898 : I'd like to keep it, too, but I'm already out of space in my room...
7899 : Meow? Is this for me?
7900 : I'm happy, but...
7901 : looks a little confused.
7902 : But what I rrreally want is a prrretty flower to put in my vase at home...
7903 : Thanks for the offerrr, though, [misterrr/miss].
7904 : Meow? A prrresent for me? Wow! Purrrrrrr...
7905 : # prrretty flowerrrs for me? These will look grrreat in my room!
7906 : With all these, I won't have to pick any flowerrrs here for my rrroom.
7907 : I looove all kinds of flowerrrs. Especially prrretty %!
7908 : looks very happy.
7909 : Thank you, [misterrr/miss]!
7910 : ...
7911 : Yes?
7912 : Do you have anything else to say? Bye bye! Don't I get anything else? ...
7913 : Bye!
7914 : (I wonderrr what's wrong with [him/herrr]..?)
7915 : (I alrrready said thank you...mew...)
7916 : Umm...anything...umm...else?
7917 : Three cheers for %! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
7918 : (I hope that was enough...)

7920 : This is my favorrrite flowerrr in the whole wide worrrld! Purrrrrrr...

7925 : Whisper...meow...whisper)
7926 : You have learned your way through the back alleys of Windurst! Now you can exit to any area from your residence.
7927 : Heh-heh... Pretty cool, huh?
7928 : looks pleased with herself.
7929 : Don't forrrget, you prrromised not to tell anybody! Not even the other memberrrs of the Star Onion Brigade!
7930 : This is just between you and me!
7931 : Thank you Thank you Thank you
7932 : Thank you for all the prrretty flowerrrs!

7938 : ...
7939 : You, you, you...
7940 : You can't move the hearrrt of a lady with junk like this!
7941 : You'll need something more--more exciting, more excellent, more extrrravagant! Something like flowerrrs...
7942 : There aren't many people who can imprrress me.
7943 : Herrre. I don't need this, [misterrr/miss].
7944 : How beautiful! You really know the way to a lady's hearrrt.
7945 : But this is just the basics. You've still got a ways to imprrress me!
7946 : This tiny bouquet is cute, but you're still far from imprrressing me!
7947 : And a full bouquet! You're starting to catch on, but anyone can brrring me this.
7948 : smiles slyly at you.
7949 : If you really want to melt a girls' hearrrt, you should trrry %.

7965 : Meow? Did you already forrrget the way to a girrrl's heart?
7966 : If I took all the norrrmal gifts I got from my fans, I wouldn't have any room for the rrreally nice gifts.
7967 : You can have this back!
7968 : It's tough being adorrred by hundrrreds, but I guess I'll have to get used to it.

8008 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
8009 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
8010 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
8011 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
8012 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
8013 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
8014 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
8015 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
8016 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
8017 : You've earned conquest points!
8018 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
8019 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
8020 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
8021 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
8022 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
8023 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
8024 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
8025 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
8026 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
8027 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
8028 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
8029 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
8030 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
8031 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
8032 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
8033 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
8034 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
8035 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
8036 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
8037 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
8038 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
8039 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
8040 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
8041 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
8042 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
8043 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
8044 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
8045 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
8046 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
8047 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
8048 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
8049 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
8050 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
8051 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
8052 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
8053 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
8054 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.

8056 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
8057 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
8058 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
8059 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
8060 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
8061 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
8062 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.
8063 : You currently have # conquest points. Would you like to use them to purchase items?
8064 : Which item do you wish to purchase?

8066 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
8067 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
8068 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.

8070 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 200 conquest points.
8071 : During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
8072 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
8073 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.
8074 : The % is already fully charged.

8089 : Which service do you request? Buy/Sell items. Teleportation. Nothing.
8090 : Do you really wish to be teleported? Yes. Teleport with gil. Teleport with conquest points. No.
8091 : Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
8092 : It should please you to know that I now also deal in %. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!
8093 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
8094 : I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
8095 : I can teleport you to your home country for # gil or # conquest [point/points].
8096 : Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered.  Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
8097 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
8098 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
8099 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
8100 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
8101 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
8102 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points moderately. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
8103 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points greatly. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
8104 : I could not accept one or more items you tried to trade me. Please remove those items and try again.
8105 : Sorry. I can only take certain types of weapons, shields, or armor.
8106 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points [by a small amount/moderately/greatly]. For this transaction I will also furnish you with # gil.
8107 : My apologies, but this type of item needs to be individually appraised. Please trade them to me one at a time.
8108 : (DEBUG) Back to hometown!
8109 : What do you want? Would you cast Signet on me? I'd like to set my home point here. Nothing.
8110 : What do you want? Pay # gil and set my home point here. Nothing.
8111 : Your home point has been set.
8112 : You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.
8113 : I will set your home point here.
8114 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
8115 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
8116 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
8117 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
8118 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
8119 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
8120 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
8121 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
8122 : There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
8123 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.
8124 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
8125 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
8126 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
8127 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
8128 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
8129 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
8130 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...
8131 : Cancel your participation in the E.F. to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?
8132 : Quit the E.F.? Yes. Change locations. No.
8133 : Are you sure?
8134 : Really quit the E.F.? Yes. No.
8135 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
8136 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
8137 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
8138 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
8139 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
8140 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
8141 : You received # conquest points!
8142 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
8143 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
8144 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
8145 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
8146 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
8147 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
8148 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
8149 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
8150 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
8151 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
8152 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
8153 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
8154 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
8155 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
8156 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
8157 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
8158 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
8348 : PAUSE
8350 : I see you're working hard.
8351 : Ch...Chief Cid!
8352 : Oh, you don't have to go and be all formal. Have there been any changes around here?
8353 : No sir! There has been an increase in the number of adventurers using the airship, as well as an all-around increase in exports, but no signs of any disturbances.
8354 : Truly, Chief Cid's wonderful innovations have brought wealth and prosperity to the Port Distr--
8355 : Enough with the flattery! That airship was just one invention, like many others.
8356 : What we need to worry about is the unrest in the Mines District. I'm concerned that the trouble down there is going to spill over into Port Bastok.
8357 : The escalation in activity around Norg also troubles me. Soon there will be airships going to the Outlands. Who knows what those adventurers will be up to when that starts?
8358 : Ah, and what about the Steaming Sheep Restaurant? That old place still doing fine? I mean...it's making money, right? There aren't any strange guys hanging around the proprietor...are there?
8359 : Sir? I stop in every day after my duties are complete, and business seems decent as usual...
8360 : Good...good. Forget what I said.
8361 : I wonder what's wrong with Chief Cid.
8362 : You mean you haven't heard? Cid's got the hots for the lady at the tavern. Word has it that she's a widow...
8363 : Wow. Maybe Chief Cid's got a soft spot after all.
8364 : Welcome back. How are the adventurers faring?
8365 : Lady Ayame! What brings you to this area?
8366 : I was just on my way to another appointment and decided to stop by. What is the status of Port Bastok? Is everything all right?
8367 : Chief Cid asked us the same question earlier... But there is nothing out of the ordinary, and Port Bastok is safe as long as we are here, Lady Ayame!
8368 : Very well. The one thing that concerns me, though, is the recent activity of the Tenshodo. Now that the airship will be making trips to the Outlands, I feel that they may team up with the pirates in Norg for another one of their get-rich-quick schemes.
8369 : I have heard that Milady conducted her training in Norg. I am grateful for this important piece of information. I will reinforce the number of guards I have patrolling the area.
8370 : Understood. Carry on.
8371 : <Sigh>... Surely there isn't another woman as beautiful as Lady Ayame. In the desert of Musketeers, she's a garden of roses. But I wonder why she was all the way out here.
8372 : You didn't know? Lady Ayame grew up here in Port Bastok. Right over there.
8373 : Wow... I bet her whole family is as beautiful and valiant as she is.
8374 : Like, these dudes from the Tenshodo were like, sell these beans, so like, here I am. Are you gonna buy some beans, dude?
8375 : Like, these dudes from the Tenshodo were like, sell these fireworks, so like, here I am. But like, don't go using those things around my hair, dude.
8376 : Today, festival day! You must buy. You buy now.
8377 : Welcome to my humble establishment. I have a wide variety of specialty goods from Kuzotz.
8378 : Hey therrre! I've got lots of wonderrrful goodies, fresh from the Elshimo Lowlands.
8379 : I'm trrrying to start a business selling goods from the Elshimo Lowlands, but it's not easy getting stuff from areas that aren't under Bastokan contrrrol.
8380 : Welcome! Welcome! Take a wonderrr at these specialty goods from the Elshimo Uplands!
8381 : I'm trrrying to start a business selling goods from the Elshimo Uplands, but it's not easy transporting goods from areas that aren't under Bastokan contrrrol.
8382 : Hey. Have you heard of my sister Ayame? She's a samurai and a member of the Mythril Musketeers. She's so cool. Me? I'm nothing compared to her...
8383 : But I was thinking. If I could use a katana, too, I could be cool and strong like her.
8384 : But when I asked my dad about it, he got mad and said I couldn't.
8385 : My dad's been acting strange lately. I think that he's been visiting that Kagetora from the Tenshodo.
8386 : Kaede? What are you up to now? You know you shouldn't be bothering our visitors.
8387 : I just know he's hiding something!
8388 : What do you want? You want to know about Ensetsu?
8389 : Can't even hide something from his kid. Ha! That would explain why he never was called for battle.
8390 : If you want to know why that old man is coming here, you ask him yourself. He's obviously having money problems. Maybe you can help him out.
8391 : How do I know Ensetsu? I guess you could ask the lady we both loved for that answer. Ha ha ha!
8392 : Kagetora told you that? What was he thinking? He usually isn't the type to go telling other people's secrets...
8393 : Secrets? What secrets? I knew you were hiding something, Father!
8394 : I'm not hiding anything! Children should keep their noses out of their parents' business!
8395 : Stop treating me like I'm a child! You were never like this with Ayame! I know I can learn to use a katana and be cool, just like her!
8396 : Kaede...
8397 : Father, you are buying your katana from Mr. Kagetora, aren't you? You can use one, can't you?
8398 : Ayame says she went on a journey to learn the ways of the blade, but I bet it was you who taught her!
8399 : What are you talking about...?
8400 : I hate you! Why won't you tell me the truth!?
8401 : I'm sorry that you had to see that... Girls these days grow up so fast. What is a father to do?
8402 : One day, I know I'll have to tell her the truth about...
8403 : Excuse me. I know that you must be busy, but could I ask a favor of you?
8404 : I would like to buy something back that I recently sold through the Tenshodo. However, I was told by Kagetora that it has already been shipped to Norg.
8405 : He told me that if I bring him % from the Korroloka Tunnel, he would return my item.
8406 : However, there is no way that I would survive a trip to that tunnel... I would be in your debt if you could travel there in my place.
8407 : %! I am grateful for your help...but there is one problem.
8408 : Kagetora told me that if I wanted my item back, I would need to go to Norg and get it myself.
8409 : As much as I would like to go, I cannot.
8410 : I hate to ask you again after all the trouble you have gone through, but would it be too much to ask you to take that % to Ryoma in Norg? I would be in your debt...
8411 : I appreciate all that you have done for me, and apologize for having you travel to Norg in my place.
8412 : The item Ensetsu sold here? Yeah, that's already on its way to Norg. Once I've collected my cut, I have no reason to help anybody.
8413 : I cannot express in words the gratitude I feel towards your kindness. I sold this to help support my family, but then I realized that my daughter needed it once more.
8414 : Father! What is that? You bought another sword for Ayame, didn't you? It's just not fair!
8415 : Would you stop going on about that! I have never purchased a weapon for your sister. Every katana she owns was acquired without my, or anyone else's, help.
8416 : Then what is that for?
8417 : I was going to wait, but I guess you are old enough to know...
8418 : This dagger was your mother's...
8419 : You mean this old thing was...
8420 : Mom's...?
8421 : Yes. Its real name is a shinobi gatana.
8422 : Mom was a ninja?
8423 : Long ago, Yomi...your mother and I lived in Norg. Norg is a haven for the arts of the Far East.
8424 : I was just a lowly crew member on a pirate ship. Your mother, on the other hand, was a master of ninjutsu--almost as strong as she was beautiful...
8425 : And that's probably why she found comfort in a normal, boring man like me.
8426 : When we found that your mother was carrying your sister, we left Norg and traveled here in search of a more simple life.
8427 : It was at that time that your mother told me this: she was proud of the road she had taken, and it was that very road that led her to her new life.
8428 : The hardships that she had to endure made her into the strong mother that she was.
8429 : Perhaps at that time, she realized that she did not have much longer in this world...
8430 : But she fought for ten long years until she exchanged her life for the life of our second daughter...you, Kaede.
8431 : B-but...
8432 : I never wanted you or your sister to take up the katana.
8433 : When your sister said she wanted to travel to Norg to study the way of the samurai, of course I was against it. However, if it was to keep her from becoming a ninja...
8434 : Kaede... Each day, you remind me more and more of your mother.
8435 : I remind you of...Mom?
8436 : And that's why I have been so protective of you. But maybe I was wrong...
8437 : Unlike most fighters, ninjas do not just wave their swords. They lurk in the shadows and stalk their enemies. One must have the highest level of patience and concentration to draw that blade.
8438 : Your mother left this blade sheathed to remind her of that, and now this blade will be passed on to you.
8439 : The road you travel is for you to decide, but do not forget the message that remains in your mother's katana.
8440 : Mom!
8441 : I thank you so much for your help in bringing the blade back to my home. I do not have much to offer you, but take this scroll detailing the secrets of the ninja as a token of my appreciation. It was my wife's.
8442 : No, Kaede won't be needing it. All she really needed was her mother's strong will and spirit. If she wishes to walk the path Yomi chose, it will be her decision.
8443 : But I have the feeling she will be traveling to Norg soon...to find that path.
8444 : You can now become a ninja.
8445 : Ah, %. Thank you again for all you have done for my daughter and me.
8446 : I'm going to take good care of my mom's katana. I, too, will learn to be strong like her.
8447 : I remember my sister talking about how the strongest warriors are the ones who draw their blades the least. I think I know what she was talking about now...
8448 : A Mister Hani? Now that you mention it, I do remember an adventurer going by that name... He was talking about a letter he received from some Galka.
8449 : However, he seemed more interested in his next quest than that letter. He kept asking if I knew anything about the Palborough Mines.
8450 : My late husband knew much of those mines. When I told him the stories my husband had told me, the adventurer got excited and said he was setting off for the Mines the next day.
8451 : And that was the last I heard of him. I hope nothing terrible has happened to him...
8452 : What do you mean, Ryoma sent you? He wants to know about that old scroll we found nearly two decades ago?
8453 : Why me? Ryoma knows I don't want to deal with that guy anymore...
8454 : Oh well... Listen up. It all started twenty years ago...
8455 : This is what you were looking for, right? Just where the ancient writings said it would be.
8456 : Damn, you're good, Yomi. How did you...
8457 : A ninja wouldn't be any good if she went around telling everyone her secrets now, would she?
8458 : Ha-ha. True. Now, let me get you up to speed on your next job.
8459 : Have you forgotten already, Kagetora? I told you before I left that this was going to be my last mission.
8460 : But you were kidding, right? You can't leave us now.
8461 : No, I was not kidding. If you have any problems with my decision, you can take them up with Gilgamesh.
8462 : Hey! What the hell are you doing here!?
8463 : To think that a weasel like that would end up with the hand of the most beautiful woman to ever set foot in Norg... Oh, sorry about that. I got side-tracked.
8464 : Anyway, that scroll Ryoma wants to decipher is the same one that Yomi used on her final job for Norg.
8465 : All information on it was lost after Yomi and that insect of a husband of hers moved here.
8466 : If you want to know any more, try asking Ensetsu. Rough him up a little, and the wimp is sure to spill his guts.
8467 : Ah, %. Thank you again for all you have done for my fami...
8468 : What? My wife's final job?
8469 : I can tell you what I know...though it is not much.
8470 : Our investigation into the contents of that ancient scroll took us to the Altepa Desert region of Zepwell Island. There, Yomi succeeded in deciphering it.
8471 : Just a simple ship hand, I remained on the boat during the investigation, though I did happen to get a glimpse of the deciphered scroll. The following words were written: Search out the point in the desert where rations lie stacked one upon another.
8472 : However, Yomi already traveled to that area and took % that she had found there back to Norg. If you journeyed to that place now, I do not know if you would find anything.
8473 : Yes, this resembles the same % that Yomi brought back from Altepa many years ago. But it looks fairly new... What do you think this could mean?
8474 : You want to know more about the %? Well, I am sorry, but I have told you all I know.
8475 : The information that Yomi came across on that mission was from Mitsunari's grandson.
8476 : Mitsunari left the ancient scroll to his grandson. It was this grandson who helped Yomi decipher it.
8477 : What? You too were attacked by poisonous spiders at the location shown in that scroll--the same location my Yomi was attacked?
8478 : It was a trap... Mitsunari had much knowledge in the area of poisons. Only he could devise such a plan...
8479 : Mitsunari's grandson used to live in a tent somewhere in the Altepa Desert. You could try looking for him, but where he resides now, I do not know.
8480 : There has been some commotion in the Mines District near Ore Street. People are saying that a new Talekeeper has appeared.
8481 : It sounds fishy to me, but with the disappearance of their elder, Werei, anything could be possible. And the last thing we want is an uprising by the Galka.
8482 : Go to Ore Street and talk to Medicine Eagle. He says he was there when the commotion started.
8483 : I assume an adventurer of your caliber has heard of Norg.
8484 : Well, the place is a haven for pirates. They even have ties with the Tenshodo. In any case, it's an area that cannot be looked upon lightly.
8485 : That is why we want you to travel there as an emissary. Report to Sir Naji in the President's Office for details.
8486 : Currently, Chief Engineer Cid is conducting research on the architecture in Ro'Maeve near the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. Your next mission is to travel there and assist him.
8487 : Report to the Chief Engineer in the Metalworks for further details.
8488 : We are searching for an adventurer holding vital information dealing with a certain national investigation.
8489 : The president himself has expressed great interest in this case. Proceed to the President's Office for the details of this mission.
8490 : You've been ordered by the president to deliver that %. When you have completed that task, you can return here for your next mission.
8491 : It looks like Bastok is really going to begin an investigation of the Galka homeland of Altepa.
8492 : Your role in this investigation will have you traveling to the Quicksand Caves. Get the details of this mission from Iron Eater in the President's Office.
8493 : As a continuation of Bastok's investigation of Altepa, this time you will be traveling to Zepwell Island.
8494 : You will be carrying out your part of the investigation in the Kuftal Tunnel, which connects Cape Teriggan to Zepwell Island. Report to Drake Fang in the Zeruhn Mines for details.
8495 : Senator Alois has asked for your assistance.
8496 : It is something about an expedition to Vollbow...
8497 : I just hope he's not asking you to go get lizard eggs again... Wait, you didn't hear me say that.
8498 : Recently, an adventurer who was sent to investigate the Northlands has been attacked.
8499 : According to her report, the attacker resembled the dark knight Zeid.
8500 : The strange thing is that the attacker passed a letter to the adventurer before letting her go. Now, this letter's content is causing quite a commotion in the President's Office.
8501 : You have been asked to report directly to President Karst for further details.
8502 : Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!
8503 : Try though you may, there will come a time when failure is inevitable.
8504 : Channel that agony and bitterness into creating a new plan.
8505 : Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!
8506 : Hey! You're that famous adventurer, %!
8507 : Yippee! It must be destiny that brought us together!
8508 : Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.
8509 : And I'm the besty-westy they've got! I've been looking into phenomena at a certain place.
8510 : I can't talk about it too loudly, but have you ever seen one of those huge crystals? They're found all over the world, far into the wilderness, and deep down in dungeons...
8511 : From those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth. Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...
8512 : Well, take a look at this!
8513 : As a result of our research, we finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!
8514 : Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money! However, they didn't appreciate being woken up, and attacked us.
8515 : Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight? And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?
8516 : I'm sure that you could do it! Will you help us out with our research?
8517 : Take up the challenge? Bring it on! Ah, no, thanks...
8518 : Wonderful! Here, take this %. But be warned--only a person who carries one can enter the crystal.
8519 : This % will awaken the giant crystal that is found [in Ifrit's Cauldron/in the Quicksand Caves/in the Den of Rancor/in Cape Teriggan/in Fei'Yin/in The Boyahda Tree].
8520 : Without it, you won't be getting inside no matter how sneaky-weaky you are! Oh, and if you want to take some friends with you, they also have to get % from me. Okey-dokey?
8521 : If you don't prepare yourself for battle, you'll get beaten to a pulp, like we did!
8522 : As soon as we gather our companions, we'll be jumping into the fray again.  I just hope this little researcher doesn't get in our way...
8523 : Excuse me! If I don't go with you, there's no pointaru to the research now is there?
8524 : Is it true? You really defeated a prime avatar!?
8525 : ...I see. The prime avatar said that to you? I wonder what it could mean.
8526 : ...There is no need to understand... ...You will forget what I have said...
8527 : Y-You, you're...!?
8528 : ...You have power...
8529 : ...Will you allow...that power... ...to slumber...for eternity...?
8530 : Surrender...that power...to me... and I...will craft...that power... into whatever...you desire...
8531 : Choose... What...do you desire...? What...do you seek?
8532 : What do you desire? %. %. %. %. Gil. Nothing (a pact with the avatar).
8533 : ...This is what you desire...?
8534 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
8535 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
8536 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
8537 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
8538 : Gil is what you truly want? Yes. Wait!
8539 : Are you sure? Yes. Wait!
8540 : Listen...to the voice without--my voice--with your ears...and your heart...
8541 : Bring me...   Power...     Higher...       Deeper...         ......           Stronger...
8542 : ...? ...something...interfering...?
8543 : %...! Listen to the voice within you!
8544 : If you focus, you will see the true Vana'diel!
8545 : ...Even if...that...
8546 : Uh? Huh? I went all spacey-wacey for a moment there...
8547 : Um, excuse me, but who were you again? Was I speaking with you? What were we talking about?
8548 : Did I already tell you I'm a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst?
8549 : You are now able to summon [Ifrit/Titan/Leviathan/Garuda/Shiva/Ramuh].
8550 : Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!
8551 : Hey, Juroro!
8552 : Oh, it's Ildy-Goldy!
8553 : It's been some time since you made that tuning fork. Are you still researching those giant-viant crystals?
8554 : Ah, yes, I've asked a veteran adventurer to look into that for me, but [he/she] hasn't come back yet.
8555 : ...Wait. Did [he/she] come back already? ...Or did I even ask [him/her] to do that yet?
8556 : Vhat's wrong vith you? Pull yourself together, man. I don't think the food in this country agrees with you. Or maybe you haven't been getting enough snoozy-vooze time lately?
8557 : No, it's nothing like that... I guess I have been kinda tired lately, though...
8558 : Vell, no mattaru. I'll go take a look. I've been asked to carry out an experiment with the new version of the %, the improved tuning fork of earth.
8559 : Hey [Mister/Miss] Adventurer, you look like the reliable-viable type. Maybe you can help me out here. Take this % to the Quicksand Caves in the Eastern Altepa Desert.
8560 : Using my improved tuning fork of earth along with the %, should allow more people to be drawn into the crystal than using the regular %.
8561 : Ildy-Goldy is extremely-wemely proficient in hand-to-hand combat, something very unusual among we Tarutaru. He's always high on the list when researchers are looking for a Rhinostery adventurer to accompany them to the wild lands.
8562 : With his skill, he's likely to defeat the avatar that slumbers within the protocrystal.
8563 : Please make your way to the Quicksand Caves of the Eastern Altepa Desert and bring the % into contact with the crystal.
8564 : ...By the way... You probably want to assist Ildy-Goldy with his experiment, but have you ever thought of doing your own investigation into the protocrystals?
8565 : Do you want to do your own investigation? Yes, I thirst for knowledge! Um, not really...
8566 : Well, then. First, let me introduce myself.
8567 : I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.
8568 : You lost the %!?
8569 : What a spacey-wacey individual... Well, I guess I'll give you a new one.
8570 : Welcome back. Ildy-Goldy returned a little while before. He's been waiting for you.
8571 : Oh good, you made it back in one piece. I'm sorry about before, I was completely-vetely caught up with chasing down Uran-Mafran.
8572 : I didn't end up collaring him, though. Those mages can be a slippery-vippery bunch...
8573 : ...But at least ve know the reason vhy the researchers have been acting so odd-voddly lately.
8574 : It vas all his doing. Uran-Mafran... He's been erasing everybody's memories.
8575 : Vhen you get back to Vindurst, could you report this to the principal?
8576 : I don't know if Principal Koru-Moru vill remember Uran-Mafran, but it's vorth a shot.
8577 : Urrrrgh...
8578 : Ah, excuse me! I need your help!
8579 : I just had a run-in with the beastmaster regarded as Professor Shantotto's prize student. That rogue wrested the improved tuning fork of ice from me and took off!
8580 : I have absolutaruly no obligation to hand over that incredibly difficult-to-make tuning fork to someone so uncooperative towards the Rhinostery's experiment!
8581 : I beg of you! Please go to Fei'Yin and get back the improved tuning fork of ice! Take this % for your troubles.
8582 : I just had a run-in with the beastmaster regarded as Professor Shantotto's prize student. That rogue wrested the improved tuning fork of ice from me and took off!
8583 : Please chase after that knave and take back the improved tuning fork of ice!
8584 : ...What's that you say? You'll help me get back the improved tuning fork but you also want to investigate the protocrystal in Fei'Yin?
8585 : Investigate the crystal in Fei'Yin? Yes. No.
8586 : ...Well then, allow me to introduce myself...
8587 : I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.
8588 : The improved tuning fork was used by that rougue...?
8589 : But it didn't work properly? Ahahaha, that's justice for you!
8590 : ...Oh dear Goddess... Something terrible has happened. An adventurer just collapsed in front of me and hasn't regained consciousness.
8591 : When he collapsed a cutesy-wutesy creature glowing with blue energy leaped out towards the north.
8592 : Would the adventurer's condition be the fault of that blue-glowing pixie? It must be that creature called Carbuncle I've been hearing rumors about.
8593 : Please take this. North of here...there is a protocrystal hidden within the Boyahda Tree. Maybe the source of this malady lies there...?
8594 : ...Well, I must regain my focus and continue with my work...
8595 : Um, I'm looking for an adventurer to investigate a protocrystal in this area.
8596 : Investigate? Sure. Not right now...
8597 : Well, then. I should start by introducing myself...
8598 : I am a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst. Rhinostery researchers study all kinds of plants and animals in every corner of Vana'diel.
8599 : ...We m-m-meet again... ...There is no need for violence, adventurer...
8600 : ...I just wish to ask you som-m-me questions. ...Why do you think the avatars...give power to people...without a reason...?
8601 : ..And...have you...felt the power...of the avatars...?
8602 : Hahaha... ...Rather than strength without purpose...  ...you should be seeking...true power...
8603 : What? You want another %?
8604 : Oh, all right... But be careful-wareful with this one! These things don't grow on star trees, you know.
8605 : Hmmm... Hrmmm... So it's time to use...no...
8606 : Hello? You're an adventurer, right? Maybe you can help us out.
8607 : Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.
8608 : I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist her in her study of a series of giant crystals.
8609 : But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...
8610 : We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast. Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.
8611 : No no no no no! That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!
8612 : Listen, muscle-hussle brain. Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!
8613 : Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.
8614 : That's where you come in. I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to her research.
8615 : No no no no no! Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!
8616 : Listen up. The fandangled % won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around #, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!
8617 : And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!
8618 : ... Yes, but ma'am... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...
8619 : Hmmm... You do have a point there... I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.
8620 : No, one round could not hurt.
8621 : You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle. Are you sure you still want the fork?
8622 : Are you really-dilly sure? Fork me! On second thought...
8623 : Well, you asked for it! Take this % and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.
8624 : I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you're ready, just show my companion the %.
8625 : The researcher who made the % warned that the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.
8626 : I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey. Remember, you have to be at least a level # summoner.
8627 : Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level # summoner?
8628 : Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.
8629 : Are you sure you are ready? Off to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]! My dog ate my mini tuning fork. Not just yet...
8630 : Ma'am, our adventurer has completed [his/her] preparations and requests a warp.
8631 : ... Alacazimzam-scooby-dooby... ...
8632 : Sha-mone!
8633 : Don't use that excuse on me, [young man/young lady]. If you want another %, all you have to do ask.
8634 : If you do not bring the % we gave you, my companion cannot warp you to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree].
8635 : Did you remember to bring the %?
8636 : What!? You defeated the prime avatar!?
8637 : Ma'am!
8638 : Hmmm... Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!
8639 : ... Ma'am...
8640 : ... (Now if I could only find me some real work so I could do some real adventuring...)
8641 : I don't think you'll get much out of it, but if you want to go get your buttaru kicked by the prime avatar again, all you have to do is ring another % near a giant crystal.
8642 : Remember that you must fight the prime avatar as a level # summoner. As you already know, this will not be an easy task. Prepare well for the battle.
8643 : Do you want another mini tuning fork? Fork me baby, one more time. Stick a fork in me, I'm done.
8644 : Hey! You're that famous adventurer, %!
8645 : Maybe you can help us outaru!
8646 : Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.
8647 : You already-weddy know about the super-giant crystals, rightaru?
8648 : Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight? And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?
8649 : You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?
8650 : Ahem, now let me introduce myself...
8651 : Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?
8652 : Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.
8653 : <Pshooowaaaaa> I come from the underworld. These chipshhh, you knooow, are popular among us Goblinshhh. Use with heart of shhhtatue.
8654 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.

8666 : Pay 120 gil for a fortune telling? Pay up. I make my own fortune.
8667 : Now, let us see what the winds portend...
8668 : Adventuring with % today will [bring you great fortune!/be highly profitable./bring fair fortune./be mutually advantageous./bring misfortune./be perilous./be disastrous!]
8669 : Good fortune fills your cup to overflowing. Be sure to share it with those less blessed by fate.
8670 : Stand together and you have little to fear. With your combined strength, you can overcome any obstacle.
8671 : Do not let your good fortune blind you to danger. Pitfalls aplenty await the unwary traveler.
8672 : Happiness is a state of mind. You can find laughter in even the most desperate of situations.
8673 : The day ahead will be filled with trials and tribulations, but in time the path before you will run smooth once more.
8674 : There may be clashes of opinion today, but approach each other with an open mind and all will be well.
8675 : You must rely on each others' strengths to overcome the difficulties you will face today. Don't let petty squabbles bring your downfall.
8676 : Please accept this modest gift in celebration of your good fortune.
8677 : Either you or % has already heard fate's fickle will today. You may only have your fortune told once every Vana'dielian day.
8678 : Form a party with the person you wish to check your fortune with, and then speak with me for a reading of your fate.
8679 : You need 120 gil to have your fortune told.
8680 : Ah, it's you, %. How go your perilous adventures?
8681 : Sorry to bother you, but you wouldn't happen to be the bard Carmelo, would you?
8682 : I would... Excuse me, but have we met before?
8683 : No, I don't think so. My name is Gueravrel.
8684 : Hmm...
8685 : ...?
8686 : This...this is the guy she was...
8687 : What? If you have something to say, say it.
8688 : So, what do you think about...Dariah?
8689 : I have been partied up with her for the past few months, and to tell you the truth, they have been some of the best months I've experienced since becoming an adventurer.
8690 : Have you ever seen her wield a sword? She's as beautiful and as graceful as a butterfly fluttering through the wilds.
8691 : However, I find myself not only attracted to Dariah the fighter, but also Dariah the adventurer... Dariah the woman...
8692 : ...
8693 : Ah, but enough with the small talk.
8694 : Let me inform you of the true reason why I came to you today.
8695 : Dariah has fallen gravely ill.
8696 : She has what!?
8697 : No. I don't know if the word ill is the proper word to describe her condition.
8698 : While on an excursion to Norvallen, Dariah and I came across a beautiful flower that glittered softly like a diamond. However, when Dariah placed her hands upon it, she suddenly collapsed.
8699 : She is still breathing, but will not wake up from her cursed slumber. When I inquired about her condition with one of the elder Elvaan, he called her condition the dreaded sommeil de morte.
8700 : We tried everything from medicines to magic to revive her, but our efforts were futile.
8701 : However, according to the elders, there is still one hope. An ancient melody that is said to wake anyone--the Chanson de Liberte.
8702 : Using the Chanson de Liberte may be the only way to bring Dariah back to us.
8703 : I have heard the tale of a great bard who wrote such a song...
8704 : He composed the miraculous melody to help him bring back a lost love...
8705 : They say that the ancients even used it to revive their deceased king.
8706 : But to think that the lost tune is the only way to save dear Dariah...
8707 : It is the only way. We must help her.
8708 : However, to complete the song, we must first gather its pages.
8709 : I would do the task myself, but I am afraid that without my party, I would be unable to retrieve the necessary items.
8710 : I see... We must think of a way to collect all the pages of the Chanson de Liberte before it is too late.
8711 : Exactly.
8712 : But once we have all the pages, who will do the translation of the lyrics? I know of no one who can read the ancient language.
8713 : Yes, translation... And a new arrangement of the melody will also be needed.
8714 : That is correct. You know much of this song. However, there are not many people who could complete the task of translation and arrangement.
8715 : Please, sir. Do not mock me. While I may not be famous, I am a professional bard.
8716 : Oh, so you think that you can translate the ancient language in the Chanson de Liberte?
8717 : Are you sure that you can handle it?
8718 : Of course! If Dariah is in need of my help, I will do anything in my power to assist her!
8719 : I sense confidence in your words, but will you be able to live up to them?
8720 : We shall see if you can truly do what you say, or if your words are just merely words.
8721 : Merely...words...
8722 : Merely words!? You just watch! I will save Dariah.
8723 : I regret to ask this of you, %, but would you assist me in my quest to save a life?
8724 : According to legend, the Chanson de Liberte works by calling upon the ancient gods for their help.
8725 : The three pages necessary to complete the song--the %, the %, and the %--are located deep within dungeons spread out across Vana'diel.
8726 : As I explained earlier, to save Dariah, we must gather these three pages and have them translated.
8727 : From the information I have collected, I know that one of the pages lies somewhere within a castle in the cursed Northlands.
8728 : I, too, have heard of the location of the three pages.
8729 : One is said to be hidden in an undersea cave near the Yuhtunga Jungle, while yet another lies buried somewhere in a labyrinth on an eastern peninsula.
8730 : I will deal with the translation, but I need someone to help me get the three pages...
8731 : It is not an easy task, but I feel your just heart will guide you on your journey.
8732 : You've returned with the three pages! I do not know...I do not know what to say!
8733 : I will begin on the translation right away. Dariah's life is on the line... There is not a second to lose.
8734 : I apologize, but the translation will require more time.
8735 : Hold on, Dariah... I swear on my life that I will save yours.
8736 : %! I have succeeded in translating the Chanson de Liberte! We must hurry and get this song to Dariah.
8737 : Oh, you're here...
8738 : I did as I said I would. The translation and arrangement are complete.
8739 : I see...
8740 : There is something that I have to tell you...
8741 : Wh-what!?
8742 : I apologize... Everything I have told you about Dariah...
8743 : They have all been lies.
8744 : !?
8745 : It is true that our party traveled to Norvallen. However, the story about the flower and Dariah's ailment...none of it was true.
8746 : Why would you do...
8747 : From the moment I laid my eyes upon her, I was put under a spell. Her smile... Her frown... Her strengths... Her weaknesses... I came to love them all.
8748 : However, as much as my love for her grew, she would not answer that love.
8749 : She would... She would often talk of you, Carmelo.
8750 : Kind, intelligent...strong...
8751 : And so I decided...to test you.
8752 : Test me?
8753 : I apologize for my wrongdoing.
8754 : I just wanted to see your sincerity towards Dariah. I wanted to see if you loved her as much as she loved you...
8755 : ...!
8756 : Here, take this. It is not much, but it is the only thing I can do to say that I am sorry...
8757 : Wait. I...
8758 : I underestimated you, Carmelo...
8759 : Take care of yourself...and Dariah.
8760 : Then...what did we have to get the Chanson de Liberte for!?
8761 : And what did he mean, Take care of Dariah!?
8762 : Dariah and I are no longer...
8763 : Well, no matter. As long as she is safe...
8764 : I apologize for all the trouble that I have caused you. Please take this as a token of my gratitude.
8765 : I am forever in your debt for what you have done for me. However, I have one last request...
8766 : Someday, this song will be needed to save the life of a loved one. But until that day...
8767 : I would like you to take this deep into the Sanctuary of Zi'Tah.
8768 : Somewhere in that primordial forest is a beautiful place where clear spring water bubbles up around a ring of white-flowered trees.
8769 : When the sanctuary is bathed in the hues of dusk, bury the pages of the song in that place. There it will wait for another to come along...
8770 : The road before you is long, but I know you will succeed in your task. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you have done for me.
8771 : %... You have done so much for me. I am forever in your debt.
8772 : I can't believe there are people who throw away the skins of baked popotoes! They're so tasty and so good for you!
8773 : Can I have a moment of your time? Oh...you seem a little preoccupied. Maybe when you're not so busy.
8774 : I'll be sure to ask for your help next time we're looking for an environmental warrior!
8775 : Can I have a moment of your time? Are you interested in the protection of Vana'diel's environment?
8776 : Listen to what she has to say? Lend her an ear. Uh, I have a thing to go to...
8777 : Do you know of the Gusgen Mines?
8778 : Yes, the abandoned mines in the east of the Konschtat Highlands. A frightening place in the midst of an ecological crisis.
8779 : We've heard reports about the scrap materials that have been dumped there. Evidently, they've become the breeding ground for fearsome monsters!
8780 : We are asking environmentally conscious adventurers like yourself to help by exterminating these hazardous creatures. Can we count on your cooperation?
8781 : Take on the task? You can count on me! I have to clean my Mog House...
8782 : I knew you would help! Bring me evidence that you've defeated these creatures, and I'll pay you a reward from the Vana'diel Environmental Resource Management Initiative Network fund.
8783 : Just head to the mines, and Degga, one of our V.E.R.M.I.N. field agents, will give you further instructions. Take care, now!
8784 : Well, that is a disappointment...I guess I'll just have to ask another concerned citizen.
8785 : You can get the details of your assignment from Degga, our V.E.R.M.I.N. field agent in the mines.
8786 : Oh! % from the creatures! I knew you were committed to our cause! Here is your reward, as promised.
8787 : DEBUG:
8788 : DEBUG:
8789 : The Troupe Valeriano, at your service! Well, I'm more of a behind-the-scenes kinda gal, not an entertainer.
8790 : People call me Nokky the Tree-shaker! While the other guys are doing their thing, I work on the sidelines as a quiver-maker. Basically, I can make it easier for you to lug around those bundles of ninety-nine arrows or bolts or whatever.
8791 : I've been doing this for a while now, so I've learned to bundle all sorts of stuff...
8792 : %, %, %, %, %, and % I've always been able to do...
8793 : But now I can also bundle %, %, %, %, %, and %.
8794 : Not to mention %, %, %, %, %, %, and %.
8795 : %, %, and plain old %!
8796 : And of course, %, %, %, %, and %!
8797 : Then there's everyone's favorite %, %, and %.
8798 : Finally, new to my bundling repertoire, we have %, %, %, and %!
8799 : I can even bundle those elemental cards that corsairs use!
8800 : Aren't you imprrressed? Keeping up with all these new types of ammunition is hard work!
8801 : Oh, and for the rrrecord, anything else is too much trrrouble to deal with. Not my thing.
8802 : This ain't no charity, though. I'm not really interested in gil, but... Let's see here... Flowers...? Yeah, you bring me % for every ninety-nine arrows, bolts, or whatever you want organized, and we got a deal.
8803 : I can make a quiver or pouch for up to seven sets of the same kind of ammunition. So you could bring me, say, one hundred ninety-eight % and two of those %, for example. I like to do things real efficient-like, you see, so make sure they're in multiples of ninety-nine.
8804 : smiles slyly at you.
8805 : What kinda smart-alecky baloney is this!? I told you to bring me the same kinda ammunition in complete sets. And don't forget the flowers, neither.
8806 : Just a moment there, my fine friend, got a call coming in on my linkshell. Come back in a bit and I'll sort you out.
8807 : And here you go! Come back soon, and bring your friends!
8808 : I'm real sorry, but there's nothing I can do with those.
8809 : The strength of the body is a mere reflection of the strength of the mind. If there are untraversable walls in your mind, you will find these barriers to impede the progress of your training.
8810 : If you wish to break through these obstacles and become a true master of the martial arts, then take these.
8811 : When you have sensed that the knuckles can take you no further, bring them back to me. I will be the judge of your progress.
8812 : Why have you returned? Do not tell me you shudder in the shadow of the wall that looms before you?
8813 : For what reason have you come? No reason. I've lost the weapon... I am not yet ready...
8814 : While I am disappointed with your lack of focus, you must realize that it is not the weapon that guides the [man/woman], but the [man/woman] that guides the weapon. Take another, but take care to clear your mind before starting anew.
8815 : You are not seriously thinking of giving up, are you?
8816 : Quit your training? Yes. No.
8817 : And I thought that you might be...the one... Perhaps in my old age I have lost the ability to recognize true power... I do not require you to return the knuckles of trials. Dispose of them as you wish.
8818 : You have not yet traversed the barriers of your mind and spirit. You must continue your training.
8819 : I see that you have broken through the first wall. However, you must not let your mind rest, as another trial awaits you. Travel to the Bostaunieux Oubliette and focus your inner power towards defeating the foe that stands before you--and the one that resides within you.
8820 : Only then will your mind be clear enough to recognize the truth.
8821 : So you have vanquished the monster of the Bostaunieux Oubliette. Your mind and body are now one. You are ready for what I am about to teach you.
8822 : Long I have waited for someone to pass this on to...
8823 : I wondered many years if this day would ever come. Even the best of my students...even she wasn't ready... Even she wasn't...
8824 : You have learned the weapon skill Asuran Fists!
8825 : Hey, I know you. You're that adventurer that everybody's been talking about. I've got a proposition for you, if you're interested.
8826 : There's this lady, Olavia, who wants somebody to guide her through the Crawlers' Nest. She says that she's an adventurer as well, but thinks that she can't make it that deep on her own.
8827 : She said she'll be waiting at the entrance of the nest, but she didn't say what day or what time. Just meeting up with her might be the biggest challenge of this job, ha ha ha.
8828 : Yeah, I know it sounds like a pain, but word has it that she's paying well. What have you got to lose?
8829 : That Olavia said she'll be waiting at the entrance of the Crawlers' Nest, but she didn't say what day or what time. Just meeting up with her might be the biggest challenge of this job.
8830 : Wait a minute... Don't tell me that you're backing out.
8831 : Back out of the deal? Right now. Not just yet.
8832 : Well, I guess I'll just have to find somebody else. Good thing this town is crawling with adventurers.
8833 : Oh, %! I heard you met up with Olavia and helped her out. Here's your reward.
8834 : Hmmm... I'm sorry, but there just isn't any good work these days. If I get anything, I'll hold on to it for you, though. Don't be a stranger!
8835 : OK
8836 : NG
8837 : Number # is the answer.
8838 : Excuse me, [sir/madam]. If you are boarding the airship, might I ask you a favor?
8839 : A passenger who intended to board the next flight dropped this...
8840 : I cannot leave my post, so I was wondering if you could return it to its rightful owner in my stead?
8841 : Return the dropped item? Gladly. Sorry, I'm a busy [man/woman].
8842 : Thank you! The passenger who dropped the item looked like this.
8843 : Have you memorized the image?
8844 : Have you got it? I got it. Not yet.
8845 : The passenger who dropped the item should be on the next flight.
8846 : I leave the rest in your capable hands.
8847 : I see... I'm sorry to have bothered you with such a trivial request.
8848 : Oh, the airship has already left... I guess we'll just have to leave this with the airship authorities.
8849 : You were unable to meet with the rightful owner of the item? Well, thank you for your help, in any case. I will hand the item over to the airship authorities.
8850 : What, you've forgotten already?
8851 : Have you forgotten? Yes. No.
8852 : The passenger looked like this.
8853 : It's my job to look out for suspicious characters coming in on the airships.
8854 : So this is the famous diary... I heard Mukunda was so afraid the vitriolic entries would be read by someone, he hid it in the mines.
8855 : Well, you've done your part. Let me show you where your culprit is...
8856 : The person you're looking for is in the room where that Elvaan just entered. That's all I know.
8857 : You're on your own from here.
8858 : So, you are the messenger!
8859 : What?  You think it is I who...?
8860 : I am acting under direct orders from the senator. How could it possibly be me?
8861 : You think that by accusing me you'll get away with this!?
8862 : Not this again.
8863 : This does not concern you, Kagetora.
8864 : That poor adventurer. Having to team up with the likes of you.
8865 : I have no recollection of teaming up with anyone!
8866 : Maybe you don't, but I'm sure the senator does.
8867 : Explain yourself!
8868 : Right this moment, a rumor is circulating that the Republic is forming a new organization to take over certain duties from the Mythril Musketeers.  A group of assassins.
8869 : The Mythril Musketeers, now the pride of Bastok, can no longer be sullied by the dishonorable deeds they performed in the past.
8870 : This new organization will be created to handle just such assignments.
8871 : I would have heard about a rumor of that magni--
8872 : You know the truth of this rumor. You would've heard it straight from the senator's mouth.
8873 : ...
8874 : The Republic is currently in the process of screening applicants. The logic is simple.
8875 : Two adventurers are approached separately and assigned the same task. Whoever completes the objective first gets the job.
8876 : You seem to be well-informed...
8877 : This isn't the first time they've tried something like this. The last time, the adventurers concerned were so involved with tripping each other up that their quarry got away.
8878 : But it seems you've passed the test. The senator will be most pleased with the results, I'd wager.
8879 : Hmph... Being evaluated like a prize chocobo does not endear me to the senator.
8880 : However, if this paves my entry into the assassins, I'm willing to swallow my ire.
8881 : Listen well, adventurer. I am the victor this day, and I will brook no attempts to steal my position with the assassins!
8882 : That one's ambition hasn't tempered any since he left Norg. Viresefilant never changes.
8883 : He lusts after glory, even more so than skill and technique. Always wanting to serve under a person of prominence. When he heard that Ayame had become a Mythril Musketeer, he threw his training away and left Norg behind.
8884 : He slipped into bodyguard work, and that's where the senator found him--a perfect candidate for his new organization.
8885 : Why is Viresefilant so obsessed with fame, you ask?
8886 : Probably his upbringing.
8887 : Both parents were exceptional samurai. However, they led a spartan lifestyle and cared little for material wealth.
8888 : I guess that was more than Viresefilant could take. He chose the path of a mercenary ninja and a life in the shadows.
8889 : He decided against the way of the samurai and the lifestyle of his parents. And now Ayame, a samurai herself, has become a Mythril Musketeer. Ironically, Viresefilant's decision to train as a ninja ruined his chances to improve his station in life.
8890 : You can bet that this twist of fate served as further fuel for his ambition, and allowed him to be manipulated by the senator's lies...
8891 : Well damn, I'm chatty today. Starting to sound like an old man, criticizing somebody else's life like this...
8892 : The IRNC has dispatched me to help support all those who wish to participate in Conflict.
8893 : Before you can take part in this Conflict event, you must first possess %. You can obtain one from your nation's Conflict Commander, [Excenmille, stationed in Northern San d'Oria./Invincible Shield, stationed in the Metalworks in Bastok./Mhabi Molkot, stationed in Heavens Tower in Windurst.]

8946 : If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The match score section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
8947 : Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
8948 : You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
8949 : No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
8950 : The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed # members, or if there are fewer than # members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
8951 : Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
8952 : LS Liga is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
8953 : A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
8954 : The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
8955 : If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
8956 : After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
8957 : Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
8958 : In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
8959 : Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
8960 : Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
8961 : However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
8962 : Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
8963 : Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
8964 : The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
8965 : In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
8966 : In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
8967 : I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
8968 : What do you wish to know about? Basic rules. About the Petra. About Sprint. About Scout. About Gate Breach. About area-specific rules. About returning to battle. About special rules. Nothing at the moment.
8969 : Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word ballista means to throw a stone, and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.
8970 : The rules are simple. Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.
8971 : Players from both teams must search for Petras that a Herald has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as Rooks.
8972 : These Rooks can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their Petras into them.
8973 : Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.
8974 : Petras can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the Quarry (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.
8975 : Sometimes a player may find items other than Petras, such as potions. These temporary items can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).
8976 : Players can carry more than one Petra, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them. However, players will lose their Petras if they: (1) Successfully throw them into a rook. (2) Leave the area. (3) Are knocked out.
8977 : But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the Sprint command while in possession of a Petra. And, players can only use the Scout command if they carry one of the stones.
8978 : As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.
8979 : All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the Sprint command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain Petras.
8980 : However, remember that once a player has obtained a Petra, he or she will be unable to use the Sprint command. In its place, though, one may use the Scout command.
8981 : The locations of the Rooks are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.
8982 : Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate Rooks. However, another way is by using the Scout command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest Rook.
8983 : Finally, Scout can only be used when a player is carrying a Petra. Because Sprint cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.
8984 : So, a Petra has been obtained and a Rook located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.
8985 : There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.
8986 : To throw a Petra into a Rook, a player must first wait until the Rook's gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.
8987 : But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve Gate Breach status. Only then will his or her shots count.
8988 : This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.
8989 : Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.
8990 : The following match types are area-specific: All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains
8991 : Best of Three series rules are as follows: Winning a match will earn a nation one match point. The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for come-from-behind victories.
8992 : Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.
8993 : Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.
8994 : When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.
8995 : For more information on temporary items, refer to the special rules.
8996 : After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.
8997 : If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.
8998 : Please note that many of the rules previously considered special have been fully implemented. Also, several new special rules have been added.
8999 : Learn about which special rules? Temporary items. Ballista Points. Scoring restrictions. Gate Breach radius expansion. Resistance to Sleep. Open entries. Minimum level restrictions. Re-entry restrictions. Participant & Rook numbers. Experience Points. Return.
9000 : Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as temporary items for use at any time during the match.
9001 : Players can hold up to ten temporary items, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.
9002 : If players who possess ten temporary items find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.
9003 : Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.
9004 : Finally, the Heralds will collect temporary items when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.
9005 : Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is #.
9006 : While it is taken into consideration, scoring Petras is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.
9007 : Ballista Points can be traded for special vouchers, which may be exchanged for free temporary items at the start of new matches.
9008 : However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match. Speak with a Marshal directly after a match to register your points.
9009 : Players will only be allowed to score up to five Petras at a time. Also, a player's Gate Breach status will be automatically disengaged if a Petra is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.
9010 : All allies within a certain radius will achieve Gate Breach status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.
9011 : Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.
9012 : During the entry period, from #:, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.
9013 : In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced: Level 30 matches: 130
9014 : Level 40 matches: 3140 Level 50 matches: 4150 Level 60 matches: 5160 Unrestricted matches: 61
9015 : Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.
9016 : When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.
9017 : Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.
9018 : Read which chapter on B.P. Ranking? Basic Information. Registering Points. Rewards. Chevron & Title List. None.
9019 : Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.
9020 : Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register [his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.
9021 : After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.
9022 : If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, [he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special chevron as well as a new title.
9023 : There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as twenty different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty jobs.
9024 : Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, [he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.
9025 : Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.
9026 : However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.
9027 : Finally, checking someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.
9028 : View which chevron/title? 1st (overall). 2nd (overall). 3rd (overall). 4th-10th (overall). 1st (warrior). 1st (monk). 1st (white mage). 1st (black mage). 1st (red mage). 1st (thief). 1st (paladin). 1st (dark knight). 1st (beastmaster). 1st (bard). 1st (ranger). 1st (samurai). 1st (ninja). 1st (dragoon). 1st (summoner). 1st (blue mage). 1st (corsair). 1st (puppetmaster). 1st (dancer). 1st (scholar). 1st (geomancer). 1st (rune fencer).

9071 : Hey you! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! Is that big hunk of junk yours?
9072 : Huh...?
9073 : Um...?
9074 : I said, is that thing yours? Don't make me repeat myself again, if you know what's good for you!
9075 : This thing... Do you mean the airship?
9076 : No, I mean the funny thing you're wearing on your head... Of course I mean the airship!
9077 : Well, yes. This airship was built by the Republic's top engineer, Cid.
9078 : Alright, where is this Cid guy? C'mon, bring him on out!
9079 : Ah... Um... If you are looking for Cid, he should be in his laboratory in the Metalworks...
9080 : Got it! Now how the hell am I supposed to find this Mentalworks place...?
9081 : Who was that girl? It was like a hurricane hit the agency!
9082 : I just wanted to get rid of her, so I told her where the Metalworks was. I hope that Cid doesn't get too mad at me...
9083 : Recently there have been reports of airships colliding with large, unidentified objects in the sky.
9084 : Luckily, these incidents have been isolated and have not involved any commercial flights. However, if something is not done immediately, a terrible accident is bound to occur.
9085 : Where... Why, this isn't...
9086 : Huh!? This ain't San d'Oria! I thought we were going to the cathedral.
9087 : Smooth move there, Louvie. You look all smart and stuff, but you really oughta get yourself a compass.
9088 : Come on, admit it. You took a wrong turn back there, didn't you?
9089 : No, we are right where we are supposed to be--Bastok.
9090 : However, we must have arrived slightly ahead of schedule, as I do not see our welcoming party.
9091 : Well, that is of no matter. Let us be off for the Metalworks!
9092 : How did that party arrive in Bastok?
9093 : Why, by airship, of course! They took the commercial flight out of Jeuno like the rest of the adventurers. Yes...the commercial flight... Ha ha ha...
9094 : Oh, why does Cid always have to go off and make things hectic for everyone?
9095 : I mean, taking that airship to the skies while still in its testing phase...without even a single member of the repair crew...
9096 : Ah! You didn't happen to hear me just now...did you?
9097 : Adventurers, one and all! Your help is needed to investimigate the Moblin settlement that has appeared in North Gustaberg!
9098 : Reportificate to Mythril Musketeer Ayame for the details!
9099 : Yes? Oh, you've decidified to undertake the task from Mythril Musketeer Ayame?
9100 : Welcome aboard. I am a researcher affilimiated with the Rhinostery in Windurst.
9101 : I must warn you, this investimigation will be rather difficult.
9102 : Other adventurers who have returned from the Moblin settlement so far have reportificated Bastok's new neighbors to be extremely unwelcoming.
9103 : I supposify we are the intruders from the Moblins' point of view. If only we could communificate with them somehow...
9104 : But putting that aside, your task will be to acquiremirize any unusual Moblin-type objects you come across.
9105 : And that doesn't mean pilferizing them from the inhabitants of Movalpolos! You are to find some friendly Moblins and obtainify items through your might of negotiation. Take care, bye bye now!
9106 : Your task is to acquiremirize any unusual Moblin-type objects you come across.
9107 : Don't restify on your laurels! Please continue your investimigation.
9108 : You obtainified %? Let me see...
9109 : Well, this is most surprisifying! This looks like a book of worshipification!
9110 : Is it possible that the Moblins worshipify the same Dawn Goddess as the Kingdom of San d'Oria?
9111 : This discovery may help us to avoidimirize a conflict altogether.
9112 : I'm not entirely sure what this is, but the smell is horrendificacious.
9113 : Could this be some variety of Moblin beverage? I would like to transportimize this to the Rhinostery for further investimigation, but I doubt I'd be allowed on the airship!
9114 : This is not a Moblin weapon as far as I can ascertainify. The style is closer to something producimicated in Bastok...
9115 : It appears to be constructimified with a mineral that is rarely found these days.
9116 : The engravimication on this piece is masterful. This must be the work of a talented goldsmith.
9117 : Do the Moblins have goldsmiths, I wonder? Or could this be from...
9118 : This is an identifimication tag worn by workers in Bastok's mines...
9119 : It appears to be of significant age.  The Moblins must have discoverified it in a tunnel somewhere.
9120 : Hmmm. Please indulgify my cogimitation a moment.  I feel a hypothesis hatching from my subconscious ruminifications...
9121 : There is a name engravimified on that old tag you brought me.
9122 : If we imposify upon the person to whom this name belongs, we can determinate the accuracy of my hypothesis.
9123 : Let's see... Pa...Pav...vke?
9124 : I can decipherify this, I know I can... Pa...v...vke?
9125 : If we imposify upon the person to whom this name belongs, we can determinate the accuracy of my hypothesis.
9126 : This name is somewhat difficult to decipherify... Pa... Pav...vke? P...av...vke?
9127 : Have you heard about the commotion that occurified in the Steaming Sheep? A group of Goblins suddenly appeared and burstificated into the restaurant.
9128 : Apparently they were trying to locatify a pair of patrons that was conversimirizing inside--a rusticated Galka and an Elvaan.
9129 : But it didn't look like they were there for conflictimication. They said they had come to welcomify the pair.
9130 : I wonder if they travelmilated all the way here from Jeuno. Those goblins must be very well-mannerified.
9131 : Those strange Goblinlike beasts... When I was still young, I remember my master telling me stories of a strange tribe of beastmen who lived underground in a city known as Movalpolos.
9132 : And that man they took away... He looked awfully familiar...
9133 : I must say I was quite astonished when the group of little beastmen arrived in my establishment.
9134 : However, to my surprise, they did not cause a single problem with any of my guests. They came in, walked over to a large Galka customer in tattered clothing, spoke with him for a few moments, and then all of them left.
9135 : According to the guard that arrived a few moments after the Goblins had left, the beastmen first appeared in the Mines District before coming here. I wonder if everything is all right...
9136 : Kbastok sis kweak! Smoblins yonly twant gstrong sfriends! Non sgoods mfrom Smovalpolos ytoday!
9137 : Kbastok! Crepublic sis gstrong! Smoblins lsell sgoods oto gstrong sfriends!
9138 : Captain Chieka was even more volatile than usual today. What a character...
9139 : Hm? What do you want?
9140 : You're looking for a girl called Sanctia?
9141 : From what I heard, Chieka bundled her into a box and threw her into the sea.
9142 : Since the young lady was making such a fuss about getting to the Marquisate, she was dropped into the water off the coast of Tavnazia.
9143 : If she had just kept her tongue still about Atarefaunet, Captain Chieka might have had pity on her.
9144 : When Chieka was young and working on her she-devil reputation, she was chewed up and spit out by Atarefaunet.
9145 : Anyway, Sanctia's probably feeding the fishes by now, and I don't mean by hand.
9146 : Excuse me, Boss, but one of the boxes we unloaded from Captain Chieka's ship was empty.
9147 : It was supposed to be filled with %...
9148 : What? Weren't you supposed to check everything before the ship left?
9149 : This is your responsibility! We need at least five % for a waiting customer. You'd better start looking!
9150 : I'll do my best, Boss.
9151 : Unbelievable. There's no way an old sea dog like Chieka would waste her time with empty cargo.
9152 : Where could the box have been emptied? Things just aren't going my way today...
9153 : Five %. It's a small price to pay for saving someone's life, but...
9154 : Where am I gonna get my hands on goods like that?
9156 : You're an adventurer, you say? Are you sure it's okay for me to have these? I have no way to pay you...
9157 : Thank you. You've saved me a lot of trouble.
9158 : I wanna tell you something. When I was unloading the cargo, I noticed this box wasn't filled with Tenshodo goods.
9159 : Instead, there was a pretty young girl inside.
9160 : Well, since she was invisible, I'm not really sure if she was pretty or not.
9161 : In any case, I guessed it must have been the lass that Captain Chieka said she dumped into the ocean.
9162 : I don't know if someone helped her out, or if she managed to escape herself, but thankfully she seemed okay.
9163 : Hm? You're looking for this girl? Did she tell me her name was Sanctia?
9164 : With all the people around, we didn't have much chance for conversation.
9165 : But I'm sure she was headed for Selbina. Probably looking for another ship to Tavnazia, from what you tell me. Unless...
9166 : There have been rumors of some weird eddy of darkness in a cave near Selbina that can take you to the Tavnazian Archipelago...
9167 : They say a guy who entered that patch of Emptiness never returned.
9168 : That story is still the talk of the town in Selbina. When your friend hears how dangerous it is, she'll give up on the idea, I'd say.
9169 : Oh, if you manage to catch up with Sanctia in Selbina, please tell her that Patient Wheel said hello, and to take care.
9170 : What do you say? I don't need them. I want some information.
9171 : What's an adventurer doing back here? Look buddy, I've got all these boxes to sort through. If you're looking for work, try someplace else.
9173 : Hey! You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right? Take this letter to that [cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?
9174 : Excuse me, [mister/lady]. Would you take this letter to the [guy/lady] in the red hat?
9175 : Adventurer-[man/lady]! Could you take this letter to that funny [guy/lady] in the red hat?
9176 : I would like to take this letter to a certain [fellow/woman] wearing a red chapeaux; however, my parents do not allow me to stray far from home. Kind adventurer, might you deliver it in my stead?
9177 : Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
9178 : Whoa! Thanks, [misterrr/lady]!
9179 : Thank you so very much, [sir/ma'am]!
9180 : Another present? Sorry, but I only have two hands, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!
9181 : Wow! Another present! Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?
9182 : Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent? You're starrrting to scare me, [mister/lady]...
9183 : I just accepted a gift from you, kind [sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.
9184 : ou've brought joy to the children of Vana'diel!
9185 : ou've brought barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel!
9186 : ##
9187 : Huh? Don't tell me you've come to ask me to make another tree.
9188 : I'm up to my ears in unfinished orders here, [buddy/missy]. I ain't got no time for every charity case that comes knockin' on my door.
9189 : Now, on the other hand, if you agreed to give me a hand with all this work, I might be able to find some time to slap together a little somethin' for you.
9190 : Help him out? Okay! No way!
9191 : Huh... Your loss, I guess. Now get outta my face before I call on some big Galka to mess you up!
9192 : Alright then! Now listen up. I want you to run down to the residential area here in the Port District and fetch my shipment of materials from the market moogle that's set up camp there. And when I say run, I mean RUN!
9193 : What are you, deaf? Find the market moogle in front of the residential area and get my materials! Now git!
9194 : It's about time. I was startin' to think you'd fell off the drawbridge or somethin'.
9195 : You know, I had you pegged for a slacker, but maybe I was wrong. You've got a fine pair of legs on you there, [boy/lady].
9196 : Here's your tree, jus' like I promised. Now move along. I've still got a stack of orders seventy-six malms high, and talking to the likes of you ain't making it any shorter.
9197 : What in Altana's name took you so long? My one-legged granddaddy coulda made it back faster than you, lizard legs! Now go and pick up the next batch of supplies from the moogle in front of the Bastok Markets residential area!
9198 : Do you need me to spell it out for you, [buddy/missy]? Find the moogle in front of the Bastok Markets residential area! R-E-S-I...D... Aw, jus' git going!
9199 : Where in the Goddess's name have you been!? I'm startin' to think it might be faster to wait for the supplies to sprout legs and walk over here themselves!
9200 : Now I've got one more errand for you. All you have to do is pick up my supplies from the market moogle in front of the Mines District residential area!  Do you think you can get it done before my great-grandchildren have to wear dentures?
9201 : Market moogle in front of the Mines District residential area! What are you waiting for!?
9202 : What? You back for more? A glutton for punishment, are we? I like that in a helper!
9203 : Alright, pick up my materials from the moogle floatin' in front of the Bastok Markets residential area. You've got # [hour/hours]!
9204 : Okay, now I want you to get my supplies from the market moogle in front of the Mines District residential area. I'm only givin' you # [hour/hours] for this one. Think you can handle it?
9205 : Good work, [boy/missy]. Here's your reward.
9206 : Huh? Who are you? I vaguely remember asking some adventurer to fetch my supplies...BUT THAT WAS SO LONG AGO I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT!!!
9207 : I ain't got time to be fraternizin' with the likes of you! Go bother someone else!
9208 : You can send all those other nations' trees to the toothpick factory, because Bastok's are number one!
9209 : Bastok's trees are the greatest in Vana'diel because we use nothing but the greatest materials! Now take this and hurry back to the craftsman before he decides to come over here and use me as a decoration, kupo!
9210 : De-co-ra-tion! Get moving, kupo!
9211 : Clear time: # minute[/s] # second[/s].
9212 : Clear time: # second[/s].
9213 : The current clear time record for [the Port Bastok course/the Bastok Markets course/the Bastok Mines course] is # minute[/s] # second[/s].
9214 : The current clear time record for [the Port Bastok course/the Bastok Markets course/the Bastok Mines course] is # second[/s].
9215 : You have broken the clear time record for [the Port Bastok course/the Bastok Markets course/the Bastok Mines course]!
9216 : Obtained: %!
9217 : Obtained:  %!
9218 : Are you saying I can infilmitrate Movalpolos with this Goblin-scentified %!?
9219 : Can I purchasimirize it from you for a thousand gil?
9220 : Sell it for a thousand gil? It's yours! I'm not done with it...
9221 : Thank you! Now, let's just removify the lid...
9222 : Ravorara opens the pot!
9223 : What!? I'm not supposified to open it?
9224 : Why didn't you advisirize me of this earlier!? What is occupyificating this pot, anyway?
9225 : This...this odor is unbearafiable!
9226 : Great miscalculacations! This can't be what I think it is...
9227 : This goes beyond the call of investimigative duty! Returnify my money at once!
9228 : ...
9229 : ...Outta my face, [buddy/lady].
9230 : I told you to scram! Or would you like a piece of me, huh? If I didn't have to waste my time bundlin' together ninja tools for sissy adventurers like you, I'd fill your ugly mug with bloody bolts faster than you could say Galkan sausage.
9231 : Eh? You're here to get your ninja tools bundled? Curse Altana! And people ask me why I hate this stinkin' job!
9232 : Well, don't just stand there like an idiot! I can't do any bundlin' until you fork over a set of 99 tools and %! And I ain't doin' no more than seven sets at one time, so don't even try it!
9233 : looks like he's ready to bite off the head of a baby coeurl...
9234 : What the hell is this!? Why don't you try bringin' what I asked for before I shove one of my sandals up your...nose!
9235 : Can't you see I'm busy right now!? Go play with your mommy, sissy!
9236 : Here, take 'em and scram. And don't say I ain't never did nothin' for you!
9237 : What the hell is this junk!? Why don't you try bringin' what I asked for before I shove one of my sandals up your...nose!
9238 : I'm just doing a bit of shopping, dearie.
9239 : Don't you have yourself a friend or a partner? You must be terribly lonesome.
9240 : What a sourpuss. Aren't you and your partner getting along?
9241 : You seem to get along well with %. I like to see people playing nice, so here's a little present for you.
9242 : Is % your little friend? Oh, I do so love to see people getting along. Here's a tasty snack for you to share.
9243 : Why, you and % are just the perfect match! It just so happens that I made a little too much for supper. Why don't you two enjoy this together?
9244 : You are currently at event status ##. The title you need is .
9245 : You obtain two %!
9246 : Come one, come all, kupo!

9249 : After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!
9250 : However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!
9251 : At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo.
9252 : Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!
9253 : That's all there is to it, kupo! To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!
9254 : That's all there is to it, kupo! Your partner seems to already be participating in the game. If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!
9255 : Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?
9256 : Play the game? Ready to go! I'll pass.
9257 : When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!
9258 : If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!
9259 : Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?
9260 : Well, kupo? You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?
9261 : Cancel participation in Azimuth Circle? Yes, freedom! I'll keep playing, thanks.
9262 : Your game has been cancelled. If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!
9263 : Wow, you found it! Enjoy your reward, kupo!
9264 : This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!
9265 : You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo! Would you like to cancel the current game instead?
9266 : We can only pass out one item to you each day, kupo!
9267 : The direction of your partner's checkpoint is [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast] as seen from your partner!
9268 : There is a compass here that points to the direction of your partner's checkpoint. The compass is pointing [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].

9297 : Was there something?
9298 : What do you need?
9299 : Is there something I can help you with?
9300 : Anything I can do to help?
9301 : What can I do for you?
9302 : What is it?
9303 : What do you say? Never mind. Let's chat. Tell me your level and combat style. Let's talk about combat signals. Let's talk about jobs. Let's talk about appearances. I need %.
9304 : I'll be going, then.
9305 : Okay, then. See ya!
9306 : Then I'll be leaving. See you around.
9307 : Very well. Until next we meet.
9308 : Then I'll see you later!
9309 : Sure. Don't hestitate to call me again.
9310 : Okay. Take care, then.
9311 : See you later, then.
9312 : Then I bid you farewell.
9313 : Oh? Bye, then!
9314 : Very well. Until next we meet.
9315 : Is that all? Then I'm leaving.
9316 : What do you talk about? Signals for low health. Signals for low magic. Signals for weapon skill usage. Other combat concerns.
9317 : Do you need to know? Yes, that would help. Not really.
9318 : Which do you recommend? Shield style. Attacker style. Healer style. Stalwart shield style. Fierce attacker style. Soothing healer style.
9319 : Time for a change? You betcha. It's fine how it is.
9320 : I was wondering if you'd seen that child we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis. Is she keeping out of trouble?
9321 : Is the little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis doing okay? Just wondering...
9322 : You remember that little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? I was just worried...ah, never mind.
9323 : Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? There's something that's been bothering me...
9324 : The girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis... Have you seen her since then? I'm just a little worried, that's all.
9325 : By the way, do you remember the young lady we saved in Eldieme Necropolis? Such a fragile little thing... I hope she's okay.
9326 : I wonder how the little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis is doing. I was just thinking about it.
9327 : So, have you seen the little girl we found crying in the Eldieme Necropolis lately? Just wondering how she was doing.
9328 : How is the young girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis doing? Hope she's staying out of trouble...
9329 : You remember that adorable little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis, don't you? I wonder if she's doing okay.
9330 : Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis lately? There's something that's been bothering me...
9331 : Do you remember the young girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? If you see her, tell her she shouldn't be wandering outside town alone.
9332 : I was thinking about that dragon we fought in Ghelsba. What was it even doing there? Does it have something to do with that mirror?
9333 : Do you remember the battle we fought with that dragon in Ghelsba? What on Vana'diel was a dragon doing there, anyway!?
9334 : About that dragon we fought in Ghelsba... Do you think the mirror was feeding it power?
9335 : There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba. Why was it there, I wonder...
9336 : Do you remember that terrible dragon we fought together in Ghelsba? It felt as though the power of the mirror had driven it into that frenzied state.
9337 : The encounter we had with the dragon in Ghelsba sure was a close call. I'm sure glad I showed up when I did.
9338 : Why was that dragon in Ghelsba? I hope it doesn't foreshadow something worse...
9339 : I wonder why that dragon we fought was in Ghelsba. Was it after the mirror, maybe?
9340 : Do you remember the dragon we fought in Ghelsba? It's strange that such a creature would be found there...
9341 : Are there usually dragons in Ghelsba? I mean, besides the one we fought...
9342 : There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba. Why was it there, I wonder...
9343 : The dragon we fought in Ghelsba does not belong there. I suspect a sinister hand behind its presence.

9393 : Do you want me to talk during battle?
9394 : I'm not that talkative, but do you want me to say what I'm doing during battle?
9395 : Would you prefer that we kept up communication during battle?

9404 : Do you need to hear it? Yes, I do. Not so much.
9405 : Fair enough.
9406 : Got it!
9407 : No problem.
9408 : Understood.
9409 : Got it!
9410 : No problem!
9411 : Fine with me.

9413 : Okay, then.
9414 : Okay, got it!
9415 : Understood.
9416 : Fine.
9417 : I haven't really thought much about jobs. What kind of combat style would be good, do you think?
9418 : Jobs? I'll try anything once. What style of combat do you recommend?
9419 : I'm not that interested in jobs. Give me a style of combat and I'll stick to that.
9420 : There are so many jobs to choose from. Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?
9421 : What combat style could I use that would be helpful to you?
9422 : Feel free to go ahead and choose my combat style. I don't mind.
9423 : I can fight in any style, no matter what my job is. Do you have any particular style you want me to use?
9424 : No matter the job, I can fight in any style! Is there a particular style you recommend?
9425 : Jobs? If the style of fighting is the same, the job doesn't matter much to me. What kind of combat style do you recommend?
9426 : I don't know much about jobs, but can you recommend a combat style for me?
9427 : There are so many jobs to choose from. Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?
9428 : You presume to have knowledge on how I should approach combat?
9429 : Hmm. I'll give it a shot.
9430 : Right! That's the style for me!
9431 : Hmm. I'll try it.
9432 : Okay. I'll try that next time I fight.
9433 : Okay then. I'll start doing that from next time.
9434 : Sounds good! Leave it to me!
9435 : Okay, I'll look forward to trying it.
9436 : Okay! Sounds like fun!
9437 : Really? Okay, I'll try it out.
9438 : Hmmm. Okay! I'll do my best!
9439 : Okay. I'll try that next time I fight.
9440 : Fine. I will try your suggested combat style.
9441 : What? You think I should change my headwear?
9442 : My headwear? You think it's time for a change?
9443 : You don't like my headwear?
9444 : Are you suggesting a change in headwear?
9445 : You want to choose new headwear for me?
9446 : You're interested in my headwear? Sure, I don't mind you coordinating my fashion.
9447 : What? Come on, out with it. You think I should change my headwear?
9448 : Huh!? You don't like my headwear? Should I wear something else?
9449 : Yes? You want me to change my headwear?
9450 : What are you staring at? Don't you like my headwear?
9451 : Are you suggesting a change in headwear?
9452 : My headwear collection accounts for all possible battle conditions. Pick one that will meet your needs.
9453 : Well, I guess I could wear something else.
9454 : Hmm, I suppose a change couldn't hurt.
9455 : I'll change it, then.
9456 : Very well. I'll find something new.
9457 : Thanks. I'll try this one.
9458 : Ooh, I like your style!
9459 : Okay, I'll change it for you.
9460 : Well, okay. A change is as good as a holiday!
9461 : I'll try something new, then.
9462 : Hmm. I'll see what I can come up with!
9463 : Very well. I'll find something new.
9464 : Well, well, it seems you have an eye for these things. I shall equip this from now on.
9465 : I'll forget you said anything, then.
9466 : Oh? Okay.
9467 : Well, that's a relief.
9468 : I'll stay the way I am, then.
9469 : So I don't need to change it? Fashion can be so frustrating...
9470 : You like me just the way I am, eh?
9471 : Well, that's good to hear.
9472 : Are you sure? Well, I guess that's a good thing...
9473 : Oh? Alright, then.
9474 : Phew! I thought you thought I looked funny or something!
9475 : I'll stay the way I am, then.
9476 : I own only the best gear, so I don't blame you for being indecisive.
9477 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9478 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9479 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9480 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9481 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9482 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9483 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9484 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9485 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9486 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9487 : You lost it? Here, take this.
9488 : You lost it? Hmph. Here, take this. But there'll be hell to pay if you misplace that one, too.
9489 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9490 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9491 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9492 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9493 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9494 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9495 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9496 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9497 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9498 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9499 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
9500 : I just gave you one! You are really trying my patience. Ask me again when I'm not so annoyed.
9501 : With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation. I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.
9502 : Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno? I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to Ru'Lude Gardens!
9503 : Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno? Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.
9504 : You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens. The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!
9505 : Wouldn't heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno? An architectural defect like that shouldn't be left unchecked...
9506 : Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what? And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...
9507 : Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping. You can't beat Bastok for jewelry, though.
9508 : Every time I come here I can't help but think that at least one person must've fallen off the edge...
9509 : Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant. Maybe I should go into the culinary business.
9510 : I wonder what kind of meals the archduke eats? Do archdukes eat curry...?
9511 : You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens. The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!
9512 : My adventurer's instinct tells me that a secret weapon sleeps here in Jeuno. Most likely the part that would form the main body...
9513 : Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete. A structure like the Chateau d'Oraguille must take centuries.
9514 : Chateau d'Oraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything! Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.
9515 : If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice. I think he has some kind of gambling problem...
9516 : Were you aware that the moat in moat carp refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?
9517 : Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all. At least military service isn't compulsory for them anymore.
9518 : A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didn't work out. I mean, where in Vana'diel am I supposed to find a slender Tarutaru beauty?
9519 : The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods. No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.
9520 : How embarrassing... I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!
9521 : Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes. Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.
9522 : Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right? What would happen if the waters rose too high...?
9523 : Were you aware that the moat in moat carp refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?
9524 : That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and-- A-ahem! Never mind...
9525 : Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?
9526 : Don't you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead? No...?
9527 : I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria. Bastok is a weird place...
9528 : I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother. He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...
9529 : How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers? I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.
9530 : I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...
9531 : I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.
9532 : I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...
9533 : I've never eaten a treant bulb before. What do they taste like?
9534 : Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok? What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?
9535 : I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother. He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...
9536 : The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...
9537 : In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor. I wonder if they ever change locations...
9538 : I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head. You should be careful!
9539 : Windurst truly is a magical nation. I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.
9540 : Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars. The property prices must be astronomical.
9541 : Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right? Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?
9542 : Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?
9543 : Windurst is famous for its hat shop. I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.
9544 : The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display. Are they not for sale?
9545 : The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild. I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.
9546 : There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst. What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods? It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...
9547 : Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars. The property prices must be astronomical.
9548 : A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.
9549 : When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...
9550 : I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos. I have my license, though. Really.
9551 : Hmm. I can't think of anything to talk about.
9552 : It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.
9553 : Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.
9554 : Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.
9555 : The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.
9556 : Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?
9557 : I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face. The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.
9558 : Are moogles considered to be beastmen? Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?
9559 : It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.
9560 : The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.
9561 : I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax. Does anything like that ever happen to you?
9562 : And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount? Maybe I'm being paranoid...
9563 : ... Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather. Not very interesting at all.
9564 : Do you notice the change? I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.
9565 : There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.
9566 : The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method. Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.
9567 : The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it! My best dress, ruined!
9568 : But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy. And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?
9569 : I like to be able to see what you're thinking.
9570 : I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...
9571 : Do you notice the change? I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.
9572 : Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and persuaded them to open shop.
9573 : No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...
9574 : I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.
9575 : I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.
9576 : Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?
9577 : I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.
9578 : I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?
9579 : Have you ever seen an aurora? It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.
9580 : I never know what to wear on windy days. I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?
9581 : I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around. What on Vana'diel do they use it for?
9582 : The smilebringers really exist, you know! They live somewhere far to the north!
9583 : Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?
9584 : In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.
9585 : I always thought it would look mysterious and unique. Maybe I just have no fashion sense...
9586 : For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that. Guess I bought too many vases...
9587 : Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go? Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...
9588 : You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.
9589 : But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.
9590 : Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?
9591 : I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it. You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...
9592 : Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...
9593 : Do they trade with people? I wonder what a beastman would buy...
9594 : They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria. You believe me, don't you, %?
9595 : You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.
9596 : But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate. After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.
9597 : You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor. I actually trade my old gear in all the time.
9598 : I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.
9599 : There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days. We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.
9600 : It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls. No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.
9601 : I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.
9602 : You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.
9603 : You really feel like chatting today, I see.
9604 : Do you eat out much?
9605 : I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.
9606 : What do you keep in your Mog House? Do you have furniture and stuff?
9607 : It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls. No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.
9608 : I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?
9609 : I have a friend in the business, you see. I'll introduce you sometime.
9610 : The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...
9611 : Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you. Why don't we train together?
9612 : I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.
9613 : To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?
9614 : M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question! It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!
9615 : Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!
9616 : Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food. Must be a metabolism thing...
9617 : I have as many as four different sets worked out... I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.
9618 : It's probably filled with flowerpots, right? Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!
9619 : I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.
9620 : What? You...journey with other adventurers...? N...not that it's any of my business, of course...
9621 : What do you say? Never mind. Let's chat. Let's talk about quests. Let's talk about battle. Let's talk about appearances. I need %.
9622 : What do you ask about? Quests we've taken together. Quests you're on now.
9623 : What do you ask about? I've changed my mind. Tell me your level and combat style. Combat signals. Combat styles. Weapons skills.
9624 : What do you ask about? I've changed my mind. Headwear. Fashionable equipment.
9625 : What should I wear? Your current headwear is fine. A leather bandana. An iron visor. A trader's chapeau. An iron mask. A mythril sallet. A tiger helm. A war beret. An austere hat. A wyvern helm. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. No headwear at all.

9637 : So, which do you think would suit me?
9638 : Fashionable equipment? Tell me what you think suits me!
9639 : So, what do you think would suit me?
9640 : I wonder what would suit me...
9641 : Is there something that'll suit me?
9642 : Ooh, you wanna coordinate my attire for me?
9643 : I think I look good in most things, but give me your honest opinion on which would suit me best.
9644 : Oh, so much to choose from! You pick for me!
9645 : So, what do you think would suit me?
9646 : Oh! Pick something that doesn't make me look fat!
9647 : I wonder which of these would suit me...
9648 : If you have an opinion, let's hear it.
9649 : What equipment looks best? I'm not really sure. Body. Hands. Legs. Feet. None.
9650 : Any other suggestions? None. Body. Hands. Legs. Feet.
9651 : I think you're right. I'll stick with this for a while.
9652 : I like your taste! I'll wear this for a while.
9653 : Hmm. Well, I guess this isn't too bad...
9654 : Well, then. I'll see that I wear this from now on.
9655 : This one? I think I like it! I'll wear it from now on.
9656 : Heheh, I had a feeling you'd pick this one. I've got a pile of spares, so there's no need to worry!
9657 : Oh? Not a bad choice. I'll wear this for a while, then.
9658 : Oh! That's my wardrobe sorted for a while!
9659 : If that's your choice, I'm happy to go with it for the time being.
9660 : Nice! I'll wear this from now on.
9661 : Well, then. I'll see that I wear this from now on.
9662 : Hm... Looks like your fashion sense is above average. I have no qualms about your selection.
9663 : This...?
9664 : Are you sure...?
9665 : ...
9666 : I see...
9667 : Uh-huh...?
9668 : This thing here...?
9669 : I suppose fashion is not your game...
9670 : This? Um...okay...
9671 : This...?
9672 : Really? Kinda boring, but okay...
9673 : I see...
9674 : Hmph... Remind me not to ask your opinion again.
9675 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
9676 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Do you wanna help me out?
9677 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
9678 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It appears to be a most complicated phenomenon.
9679 : Actually, I've been asked to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Can you help me out?
9680 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It's not exactly exciting, but can I rely on your help?
9681 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. How about helping me out?
9682 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Do you wanna come along?
9683 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
9684 : Actually, I've been asked to look into this Emptiness thing. Why don't you come along?
9685 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It appears to be a most complicated phenomenon.
9686 : Actually, I found a new assignment for you, to fill up your abundance of spare time. It's an investigation of the Emptiness.
9687 : I don't want to interrupt your other adventuring activities, so just come along when you're ready.
9688 : Any time is fine. Just show up and I'll be there. Try not to forget about it though, huh?
9689 : Maybe I'll run into you in Promyvion. See you there.
9690 : If I may, I would like to have your assistance in this matter. I have no strict timetable, so please come along when you are ready.
9691 : Any time is fine, so please help me! I...I'll be waiting for you in Promyvion. Please come quickly--that place gives me the creeps!
9692 : I'd appreciate your help whenever you can afford it.  Looking forward to seeing you in Promyvion!
9693 : Whenever you have free time is fine. I'll be waiting for you.
9694 : Anytime is fine. Just show up and I'll be there. Try not to forget about it though, huh?
9695 : You can show up whenever you have time. I'll even prepare a reward for you.
9696 : Come on, it'll be fun! I'll be there whenever you're ready.
9697 : If I may, I would like to have your assistance in this matter. I have no strict timetable, so please come along when you are ready.
9698 : Considering I was the one who accepted the assignment, it's only fair I accompany you. I will be waiting on location, so hurry up with your preparations.
9699 : Thanks for your help the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
9700 : I'm glad you were there the other day! Here, take this and call any time you need me.
9701 : Oh, I have something for you in return for your help the other day. Here.
9702 : Thank you for your assistance the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
9703 : Thank you so much for the other day. This isn't much, but it's just my way of showing my appreciation. Use it to call me anytime!
9704 : I really appreciate your help the other day. Everything worked out really well. If there's anything I can do in return, just use this to call me, okay?
9705 : Your help the other day was most appreciated. Take this, and use it to call me if you're ever in need.
9706 : Thanks a bunch for your help the other day! Use this to call me and I'll return the favor!
9707 : Thanks for your help the other day. Here, take this and call me anytime.
9708 : Thank you so much for your help the other day! Here, take this and call me if you're ever in trouble.
9709 : Thank you for your assistance the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
9710 : You did very well the other day. Here, this is your share of the reward for completing the assignment.
9711 : That % you're holding, is that about combat styles? Can I take a look?
9712 : Hey, is that % you're holding about combat styles? Can I take a look?
9713 : Is that % about combat styles? Let me borrow it for a bit.
9714 : Does that % you hold pertain to combat styles, by any chance? Might I take a look?
9715 : What's that? Hey, isn't that % about combat styles? Can I have a look?
9716 : How did you come by an unusual item like that? Wait a minute. That %...isn't it about combat styles? Mind if I sneak a peek?
9717 : Hm? Is that % you're holding about combat styles? Would you mind if I borrowed it?
9718 : Hey, is that % you're holding about combat styles? Don't be a hog, hand it over!
9719 : Would that % you're holding be about combat styles? Can I see it?
9720 : Hey, is that % about combat styles? Lemme see! Lemme see!
9721 : Does that % you hold pertain to combat styles, by any chance? Might I take a look?
9722 : Hm? How did you come to be in possession of that %? Go on, show it to me.
9723 : Hmm, that made a lot of sense. Let me know if you find any more of these.
9724 : That was pretty informative stuff. If you find any more manuals like that, let me know!
9725 : Hmm. There's a lot more to combat than I thought. Let me know if you find any more manuals like that.

9727 : Wow, so much I never knew... If you have any more of these, please show them to me!

9729 : Well, that cleared up a few things for me. Let me know if you find any similar books.
9730 : Wow! I never knew there was still so much to learn! If you find any more of these, you know where to bring them!

9735 : Your adventuring fellow has learned a new combat style!
9736 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. Personally, I think it's better off broken...
9737 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. I bet something incredible will happen when we do...
9738 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. Luto has been blinded by her lust for treasure...

9745 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. I'm a little scared, to be perfectly honest...
9746 : I wonder if the mirror can truly be repaired. Let us not waste any time gathering the information Luto mentioned.
9747 : So the fate of that mirror has fallen into our hands... First, we must seek the items Luto spoke of.

9773 : Two mirrors... All this talk of mystery is making me hungry...
9774 : Glass of Blessed Radiance... What connection could it have to the Mirror of Blighted Gloom?
9775 : The Lost Looking Glass... Now there's a book I should like to read.
9776 : Two mirrors... Could there also be an opposing entity to the Glass of All-Seeing?
9777 : Hmmm... I can't help but wonder if there's a reason for there being two mirrors.
9778 : Two mirrors... Sounds kind of romantic.
9779 : Two mirrors... I wonder what the connection is...
9780 : Two mirrors... There's some secret we're missing here.
9781 : Looks like there are two mirrors. What powers does the other one have?
9782 : The Lost Looking Glass... Now there's a book I should like to read.
9783 : The Glass of Blessed Radiance...and the Mirror of Blighted Gloom. The contrasting names suggest much, but reveal little.
9784 : Palometa has had a difficult time, it seems. I hope we can help her out.
9785 : Palometa is a brave little girl. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her!
9786 : Palometa is an unusual child... The daughter of the guardian...
9787 : It seems that Palometa is the true owner of the mirror. I hope for her sake we can locate that unusual metal...
9788 : So the mirror belonged to Palometa. I hope we can fix it.
9789 : All this is too much for young Palometa to handle alone. Let's do what we can to help the little lady!
9790 : Poor Palometa has had it rough. We should do all we can to support her.
9791 : Palometa is a brave little girl. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her!

9796 : The Dark Divinity... Why would anyone want to channel its power?
9797 : Who is this Dark Divinity, anyway? Do you know, %?
9798 : The Dark Divinity... Why would anyone want to channel its power?
9799 : The Dark Divinity... A foreboding title. I wonder if we should be doing this...
9800 : The Dark Divinity... What a scary sounding name... What do you think, %?
9801 : Oooh, the Dark Divinity. This is getting interesting, eh, %?
9802 : The Dark Divinity... Why would anyone want to channel its power?
9803 : The Dark Divinity... I don't think I really want to fix the mirror anymore...
9804 : The Dark Divinity... Should we really be fixing that mirror? I think my instinct in breaking it was the correct one.
9805 : The Dark Divinity... Why would anyone want power from such a scary-sounding source?
9806 : The Dark Divinity... A foreboding title. I wonder if we should be doing this...
9807 : The Dark Divinity... What self-respecting adventurer wouldn't harbor a secret desire to go head-to-head with such a being?

9963 : I heard somebody at the warehouse saying that the people from Aht Urhgan are sneaky.
9964 : I wonder if that's true...
9965 : Being a mercenary sounds so much more exciting than staying cooped up in this town all day.
9966 : Man, I'd really like to go to Aht Urhgan...
9967 : What's an adventurer doing back here? Look, buddy, I've got all these boxes to sort through. If you're looking for work, you should go to the Near East.
9968 : I am surprised that someone like you would be interested in the Empire of Aht Urhgan.
9969 : Lately, the beastmen there have been causing all sorts of havoc. The effect on trade has been rather negative, I'm afraid.
9970 : I'd take my hat off to anyone who could think of a way to actually profit from the situation.
9971 : I'm pretty sure someone mentioned something about a nation called the Empire of Aht Urhgan to me before...
9972 : Now who was that, again...?
9973 : Wait... Would you happen to be one of those adventurers?
9974 : Well, are you? Yes, and proud of it! I know you are but what am I!?
9975 : Well then, I shall entrust you with this!
9976 : It seems I was mistaken. Oh well, I have plenty of these to spare. Take one anyway.
9977 : % obtains %!
9978 : You would like to know more about the badge, would you? Well, do you see how it is shaped like a wildcat's head? That is our company emblem. Go ahead--put it on. It won't hurt you.
9979 : You want to know more? Quite the bother, aren't you? Our company, Salaheem's Sentinels, is the largest, most prestigious, and esteemed establishment in Vana'diel!
9980 : We have even been sanctioned by the mighty Empire of Aht Urhgan! Alright... To put it in words you might understand, we are mercenaries.
9981 : And...! We are currently recruiting new members! Therefore, it would be much appreciated if you could show that badge to others in this town. A bit of advertising would really help us out.
9982 : Oh, hello. It seems that the number of people interested in our organization has begun to increase.
9983 : Your % was created using advanced alchemy techniques. It will shine brightly near people whose thoughts are currently drifting across the vast sea towards the golden fields of Aht Urhgan.
9984 : Oh, it's you! Many people have expressed interest in Salaheem's Sentinels!
9985 : It looks like your % has lost its luster, so I will take it back now.
9986 : % hands over the %.
9987 : I will give you this in its place. If you ever go to Aht Urhgan, please stop by Salaheem's Sentinels.
9988 : You obtain %.
9989 : Remember to visit Salaheem's Sentinels in Al Zahbi the next time you visit the Empire of Aht Urhgan!
9990 : Hello! When it comes to celebrating and festivities, I'm your moogle, kupo! Today I'm here on behalf of the M.H.M.U. to reward adventurers for their hard work in protecting our cities!
9991 : Greetings from the Mog House Management Union! When it comes to celebrating and festivities, I'm your moogle, kupo!
9992 : I don't know what we'd do without you... Keep it up, kupo!
9993 : You there. I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of ghosts?
9994 : Have you heard? Ghosts!? Yes, I've heard.
9995 : Then we may move on to more important matters.
9996 : Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?
9997 : <Sigh>... Allow me to explain. I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.
9998 : I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.
9999 : The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...
10000 : These ghosts are not simple apparitions.
10001 : When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.
10002 : And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.
10003 : The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control. I am at the point of capitulation.
10004 : That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.
10005 : I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.
10006 : Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.
10007 : Will you help? Of course. Not a ghost of a chance.
10008 : Ahaha... How droll. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
10009 : Most excellent. There is one thing you must be aware of, however.
10010 : These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.
10011 : If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.
10012 : I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.
10013 : The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.
10014 : Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.
10015 : Good luck.
10016 : Is that the glow of success I see upon your face? What of the spirit...?
10017 : I see... So that is her purpose...
10018 : The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.
10019 : I will prepare for the exorcism.
10020 : You have been a great help. Please take this as a token of my appreciation.
10021 : This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities. Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.
10022 : However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.
10023 : What has befallen you? Do you wish to give up?
10024 : Give up? I'm done. Not yet.
10025 : A pity. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
10026 : Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.
10027 : Ah, you're back! Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.
10028 : Will you consent to aid me again?
10029 : The second spirit is called Guwanana. She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.
10030 : Good day! I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?
10031 : I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.
10032 : I'll get straight to the point. Do you want to help in an exorcism?
10033 : Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess. Let me give you the short version:
10034 : I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.
10035 : For what? I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist. You know--a banisher of spirits.
10036 : But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.
10037 : They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.
10038 : The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the Cursed Tongue. That's not a language I can understand.
10039 : That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds. Then I can find a weakness.
10040 : That's where you come in...
10041 : I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.
10042 : Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.
10043 : What do you say? Will you help?
10044 : Oh... Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
10045 : Thank you! There is one thing you should know...
10046 : These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too. If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...
10047 : But don't give up if they catch on to you. Just put the disguise back on and try again.
10048 : I've located two spirits floating around this town.
10049 : The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp. I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.
10050 : Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.
10051 : Good luck!
10052 : Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...
10053 : Hmmm... So that's why...
10054 : It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here. The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...
10055 : It's time to begin my preparation.
10056 : Oh, and this is for you.
10057 : It's a witch hat. The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.
10058 : If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.
10059 : Giving up the ghost?
10060 : Oh... Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
10061 : Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!
10062 : You know what? I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.
10063 : What do you think?
10064 : Your target's name is Pretty Heart. Wonder why he's called that...
10065 : Really? I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...
10066 : Hi, I'm Gertrude. I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town. Have you heard anything?
10067 : You have? Well, that makes my job easier, then.
10068 : Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?
10069 : No? Then let me fill you in on the details.
10070 : I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.
10071 : A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.
10072 : But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.
10073 : In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.
10074 : Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.
10075 : In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.
10076 : The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.
10077 : And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.
10078 : Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?
10079 : Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard. Please come back if you change your mind.
10080 : Wonderful. There is one thing I must warn you of, however.
10081 : These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.
10082 : If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up. They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.
10083 : According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.
10084 : The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings. I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.
10085 : Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once. There are many preparations to be made.
10086 : Good luck!
10087 : How did you fare...?
10088 : I see, so that's why she...
10089 : However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.
10090 : I will begin preparing for the exorcism.
10091 : Your help has been invaluable. Would you accept this in appreciation?
10092 : It's a witch hat. Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...
10093 : If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.
10094 : What's wrong? Have you grown tired of your task?
10095 : Oh, I see... Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.
10096 : Then I would ask you to return to your task. Good luck.
10097 : Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?
10098 : I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.
10099 : Then your next target is the one known as Maryse. Please be careful...
10100 : You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders. Return to me once you have had time to rest.
10101 : I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts. Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.
10102 : I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.
10103 : !!! You...you're no monster!
10104 : !!! You...you're no monster!
10105 : !!! You...you're no monster!
10106 : !!! You...you're no monster!
10107 : So pretty...the fountain is still so...
10108 : That must be...the chateau... And over there...the cathedral...
10109 : I never thought...to return here...
10110 : Every morning...I watched him training...from afar... If only...I had had the courage...
10111 : No...he was a Hume... I...am a witch... If I were...to confess...
10112 : And then...there was the lunch...he always carried... Someone...must have made it...for him...
10113 : He passed...without ever knowing... But I...am still here...
10114 : I... I should no longer care... I want to forget...
10115 : The fountain where he took his rest... The stones that grew wet with his tears... Nothing has changed...except me...
10116 : The moat where he swam... The shade where he slept... It is still the same...
10117 : Ah...I know you are there... But to have someone hear my pain...has lightened my soul...if only a little...
10118 : This moat...where I fell in...
10119 : I slipped...on the bridge... I fell...
10120 : He was always there... I didn't notice...
10121 : From the time that I was small... Always there to save me...
10122 : Even when I was loathed and feared... You were there to praise my power...
10123 : My brother...
10124 : But I...I was always angry... I even forgot the lunch you made...
10125 : But here... I want to tell you just once...
10126 : Thank you... Thank you for being there...for me...
10127 : Your lunches...always made with so much care...
10128 : I see you there... Listening to me... I should curse you... But I will forgive you...as my brother would...
10129 : These trees... I burned with the Fire spell... Yet they have grown back...
10130 : This stream... I froze with Blizzaga II... Yet now it flows...
10131 : This building... I toppled with Aeroga III... Yet it has been rebuilt...
10132 : The wall of the Metalworks... I cracked with Thunder IV... Yet it has been repaired...
10133 : It is as if...I never existed... Have my sins...also been erased...?
10134 : My magic...has always been overpowerful... The cold stares...of the townspeople...
10135 : I learned my spells...for vengeance... People called me...heartless...
10136 : I loathed...this nation...this town...its people...
10137 : Then why...? Why do I feel so at home here...?
10138 : Why...? Why does everything feel...so dear to me...?
10139 : You...I see you... Cease your stalking... I wish to be alone...
10140 : A genius...is never understood...by the masses...
10141 : A genius...is isolated...from the common people...
10142 : A genius...will be persecuted...by those who do not understand...
10143 : I wanted to save her... The girl with astounding talent...
10144 : To help...the girl...who had nothing but her magic...
10145 : The Dark Lilies... A coven of...chosen... A sanctuary...for witches...
10146 : Yet...I wonder... Was it all...for the best...? To leave...this world behind...?
10147 : Was she...truly happy...? Being enveloped...in the darkness...?
10148 : I wanted to search...for the answers...one more time... In this town...the town I had forsaken...
10149 : I wished to gaze once more...on the answers to be found... In this town...that I once loved...
10150 : You...go back... Back to the exorcist... Tell him...I am ready...to leave...
10151 : This...was a secret place...
10152 : A place...that nobody knew...
10153 : The perrrfect spot...
10154 : An enchanted spot... So many fish... They would just jump...onto the hook...
10155 : To fill...my empty belly...
10156 : To help...my strrruggling mother...
10157 : I would fish...and fish...and fish... We were poor...I had no other choice...
10158 : Even so...those days were fun... But I hated...being poor... I delved...into forbidden magic...
10159 : I'm sorry...Mother... The day...I left home... I wanted...wanted to tell you...
10160 : I'm sorry... I brrroke my prrromise...to lead an honest life... I wanted...wanted to tell you...
10161 : Enough... You have learned my secret... Leave me in peace...
10162 : Glimmer...shimmer... Shimmer...glimmer...
10163 : Little fishies... Shimmering fishy-wishies... Where have you gone...?
10164 : Little fishies... Glimmering fishy-wishies... Are you here...?
10165 : You mustaru be here... You mustaru be hiding...
10166 : Here and there... The fishy-wishies I let free... Shimmering...glimmering...fish...
10167 : But...I don'taru see you...? Where have you gone...?
10168 : The same as before... Nowhere to be found...
10169 : But wait... That...shimmer-glimmering... The Flash spell fused into your scaly-wales...
10170 : Glimmer...shimmer... So many little fishy-wishies... You survived...
10171 : Shimmer...glimmer... So many little fishy-wishies... You swim...and glide...
10172 : Are you satisfied...? Then hushy-wush and leave... You'll scare the fishy-wishies...
10173 : You hear a voice speaking softly...
10174 : Trick or treat? I've seen the most sensationally scary costumes around town, kupo!
10175 : What a wonderful witch hat, kupo! Since you've shown me your costume, I'll bring out some of my special merchandise, kupo!
10176 : Well met! I'm a Merry Map Marker, and I'd love to make marks all over your merry %, but it appears you are missing the markable map I mention.
10177 : Good day! I'm a Merry Map Marker, and I'd be emphatically ecstatic if you'd allow me to mark your magical map!
10178 : A markless % is like a motherless maiden, meandering through a miasmatic mire of misery.
10179 : Embark on a map-marking mission? Mark me up! Keep your mitts off my map!
10180 : Marvelous! Now allow me a minute to make all my marks.
10181 : Methinks I have marked your map with as many marks as I might manage.
10182 : Monitoring and managing your marks is as simple as merely opening your map and selecting Markers from the main menu.
10183 : If the marks on your map might vanish, mope not like a melancholy milksop. Make another meeting with me and I shall make it my mission to mark the map once more.
10184 : Good day, [milord/milady]. May your marches across meadow and mountain be markedly memorable!
10185 : Here is the area's home point. Once set, your muted remains will be moved here if you are ever...mortally mangled in the midst of a melee.
10186 : Here you will find the immigration ministers. They will help you if you may wish to immediately modify your nationality.
10187 : And mayhap you are immeasurably motivated to compete in the medieval mayhem of Conflict? Might I suggest you mingle with the modest Pursuivant located here?
10188 : Our local minstrel of melodies can be found here. His mirthful musicalities may help you recall misplaced memories.
10189 : Ah, and in the case you might wish to mask a meritorious moniker and replace it with one a mite more merited, a traveling bard strums upon his mellifluous harp here.
10190 : Here, you may meet with a member of the Specialty Goods Trade Union. And, if you are a citizen of this mighty dominion, he'll teleport you all across Vana'diel (for a menial amount of monetary remuneration).
10191 : Need to know the local weather? Our local meteorologist will be making his paramount presumptions here.
10192 : If you wish to summon a merciful mate to this mighty realm, here is where you will find a merry merchant marketing Gold World Passes.
10193 : Those men and women wondering how their deeds are mirrored in the minds of the locals should meander over to this gossip-meister to muster up important material on their respective reputations.
10194 : The armor depository located here will help you maintain any old sets of equipment muddling up your immaculate Mog House.
10195 : And here is the item depository where you may store much of your festive furniture, etcetera until misplaced holiday merriment makes it way back into your miserly heart.
10196 : Let me begin with Southern San d'Oria.
10197 : Now I shall move to Northern San d'Oria.
10198 : And last, but not least, let me mark your map for Port San d'Oria.
10199 : I shall start with Port Bastok and its magnificent drawbridge.
10200 : Now let me move on to the mercantile metropolis known as the Bastok Markets.
10201 : And after the markets, come the massive Bastok Mines.
10202 : And finally, who could forget the marveled Bastok Metalworks, where masterful minds from across the Republic meet to mull over the mysteries of man-made mechanical marvels.
10203 : Let me start with the Windurst Waters.
10204 : Let me continue by marking your map of Windurst Walls.
10205 : And while I am at it, let me see your map of Heavens Tower.
10206 : Next, I shall mark your map of Windurst Woods.
10207 : And finally, let me mark your map of Port Windurst.
10208 : I shall begin by marking the important locations on your map of the Ru'Lude Gardens.
10209 : Next, let me mark your map of Upper Jeuno. Did you know that I often frequent the Marble Bridge whenever I have a free moment? There's just something about the name of that model establishment...
10210 : Now let me mark your map of Lower Jeuno.
10211 : And finally, I shall mark your map of Port Jeuno.
10212 : Hello there! Your chocobo should be fully grown in no time!
10213 : This week's schedule: Minimum care (no charge). Emphasis on exercise (1200 gil). Physical training (1300 gil). Rest (1500 gil). Ask about current condition. Ask for a care report. Never mind.

10222 : It does not seem to have any serious illness or sudden changes in temperament. Everything looks to be in perfect order.

10225 : But its overall physical strength is a bit lower than average.
10226 : Come back any time. Your chocobo is counting on you!
10228 : Kweh!
10229 : (It seems to be in good spirits.)
10230 : Kweh.

10303 : This is the basic care plan for your chocobo. Under this plan, we will provide for your chocobo's most fundamental needs.
10304 : You can choose to give your chocobo a long rest. This will revitalize its energy and accelerate its recovery from injury or illness.

10306 : Listening to music will make your chocobo a more refined creature, and should improve its mental condition.

10309 : Interacting with children will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will have a slightly negative effect on its physical condition.

10315 : You can send your chocobo to deliver official messages. The nation will compensate you for your services.
10316 : Carrying someone on its back for a long period of time will build strength in your chocobo's legs, but will place some strain on the animal.
10317 : You can send your chocobo to dig for items to benefit the stables. We will thank you for your contribution with a certain amount of gil.
10318 : Digging for treasure will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal and may decrease its stamina.
10319 : Your chocobo can even appear in plays. This will require your chocobo to perform simple acts and will improve its receptivity.
10320 : You will receive a gil payment for this service, but appearing in a play will have a negative effect on the animal's strength and will place some strain on your chocobo.

10351 : [Watch over the chocobo/Tell a story/Scold the chocobo/Compete against others/Go on a walk (short)/Go on a walk (regular)/Go on a walk (long)]? Yes. No.
10352 : You should wait until your chocobo has more energy before doing that...
10353 : If you watch over your chocobo, it will gradually return your affection.
10354 : Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.
10355 : When your chocobo acts stubborn, you must discipline it. Remember that reproof is an act of love. It is important to scold your chocobo the moment it acts up!
10356 : You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing. Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as it's done peacefully.
10357 : Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. If you don't wander off too far, your chocobo should not get very tired, either.
10358 : Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. You should try wandering out just a bit sometimes. It might tire your chocobo a bit, but could have some positive effects as well.
10359 : Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. Wandering far from town on a walk will expose your chocobo to all sorts of new experiences!
10360 : Your chocobo already has a name.

10363 : That name is currently unavailable. Please try another combination.
10364 : Choose a word.(%)                               Cancel. View other options.
10367 : I can issue you a card that contains all your chocobo's important information.
10368 : If you trade the card to the chocobo matchmaking authority in Jeuno, you can match up your animal with other chocobos. You can buy a chococard for # gil.
10369 : Purchase a chococard? (# gil each) Yes. Not now.
10370 : To enter your chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you must first receive %.
10371 : Then, simply trade that document to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
10372 : Would you like a free form? Right away! Maybe later.
10373 : You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your %.
10374 : Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.
10375 : You can register a retired chocobo by trading % to me.
10376 : However, I will require a small fee.
10377 : Register a chocobo? (# gil) Yes. Not now.
10378 : I shall make the necessary preparations, then.
10379 : I will now register % to come when you call.
10380 : I require # gil for preparations.
10381 : I shall ready your chocobo, then.
10382 : You lost your %? Of all the irresponsible...
10383 : Anyway, I can give you a new %, but you're going to have to pay # gil for it.
10384 : Purchase %? (# gil) Yes. Not now.
10385 : Hm... This seems to be in great condition! We shouldn't need to do any work on it at the moment.
10386 : Hm... This %'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak...
10387 : For a small fee, I can give you a new % in exchange for it if you wish.
10388 : Pay for a new whistle? (# gil) Yes, please. Not yet.
10389 : Here you go. Take good care of it.
10390 : All right... You can have this back, then.
10391 : I cannot accept a fee from you this time. The % is all I require.
10392 : Here, take this.
10393 : Are you sure that you want to stop caring for this chocobo?
10394 : Stop caring for your chocobo? Yes. No!
10395 : You will never be able to see your chocobo again. Is that okay with you?
10396 : Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?
10397 : What would you like to say? Nothing. I'm sorry. It's just an animal! We weren't compatible. Take good care of it.
10398 : Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...
10399 : Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...
10400 : ... I'm disappointed in you.
10401 : I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!
10402 : We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.
10403 : Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!
10404 : You really want to retire your chocobo?
10405 : Retire your chocobo? Yes. Not yet!
10406 : Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?
10407 : Understood. We hope you enjoyed raising your chocobo.
10408 : Of course not! Such a decision cannot be made in haste!
10409 : Your chocobo learns Gallop!
10410 : Your chocobo learns Canter!
10411 : Your chocobo learns Burrow!
10412 : Your chocobo learns Bore!
10413 : Your chocobo learns Auto-Regen!
10414 : Your chocobo learns Treasure Finder!
10415 : I'm afraid we still aren't finished using the %, so I will have to return your item to you.
10416 : You give the % to the chocobo.
10417 : The chocobo looks like it's already full, but it's forcing itself to eat...
10418 : Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. You cannot feed it now.
10419 : Your chocobo has run away. You cannot feed it now.
10420 : You cannot feed a chocobo that has not hatched yet.
10421 : It seems like it will have some sort of effect on the chocobo...
10422 : Let me know if you have any questions about chocobo raising.
10423 : What would you like to ask about? The Vana'diel Chocobo Society. Time required. Chocobo attributes. Care schedule. Caring for your chocobo. Feed. Abilities and personality. Retirement. Matchmaking. Calling chocobos in the field. Items. Lost chicks. Nothing.
10424 : Just let me know if you ever get curious!
10425 : The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.
10426 : They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.
10427 : Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.
10428 : Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.
10429 : They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.
10430 : The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.
10431 : But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!
10432 : Ask about which attribute? Strength. Endurance. Discernment. Receptivity. Energy. Affection. Satisfaction. Nothing.
10433 : Strength is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.
10434 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
10435 : Endurance is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.
10436 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
10437 : Discernment is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.
10438 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
10439 : Receptivity is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.
10440 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
10441 : Energy is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.
10442 : You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!
10443 : Affection is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!
10444 : You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.
10445 : If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it %, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.
10446 : Satisfaction is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.
10447 : However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.
10448 : What would you like to ask about? What is a care schedule? Basic care. Resting. Taking a walk. Listening to music. Exercising alone. Exercising in a group. Interacting with children. Interacting with chocobos. Carrying packages. Exhibiting to the public. Delivering messages. Digging for treasure. Acting in a play. Nothing.
10449 : A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.
10450 : How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.
10451 : You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).
10452 : When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.
10453 : With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.
10454 : The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.
10455 : You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.
10456 : The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.
10457 : However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.
10458 : We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.
10459 : Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.
10460 : Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.
10461 : If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10462 : Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.
10463 : If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10464 : Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.
10465 : However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.
10466 : If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10467 : Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.
10468 : But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.
10469 : If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10470 : You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!
10471 : The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.
10472 : You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.
10473 : The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.
10474 : You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!
10475 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10476 : You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.
10477 : The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.
10478 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10479 : You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.
10480 : You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10481 : What would you like to ask about? A general explanation. Watching over your chocobo. Telling a story. Scolding. Competing. Taking a walk. Nothing.
10482 : In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.
10483 : Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.
10484 : On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.
10485 : However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.
10486 : You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.
10487 : Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.
10488 : You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.
10489 : I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)
10490 : Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.
10491 : This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.
10492 : Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.
10493 : You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.
10494 : I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.
10495 : Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!
10496 : What would you like to know about? Why feeding is important. Vegetables. Wildgrasses. Carrots. Worms. Medicines. Pastes. Nothing.
10497 : Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.
10498 : However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.
10499 : The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.
10500 : At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!
10501 : Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.
10502 : There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!
10503 : Just trade the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.
10504 : This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which % are most popular.
10505 : Chocobos also seem to enjoy % and %.
10506 : These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.
10507 : Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.
10508 : %, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to %, the effects are different.
10509 : In addition, % is effective for illness, and % for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.
10510 : Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.
10511 : %, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and % are good for its mental attributes. % are in a category of their own.
10512 : Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.
10513 : Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!
10514 : For example, % will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and % will restore its energy.
10515 : But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...
10516 : The most curious of all the worms is the %. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...
10517 : Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.
10518 : % will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.
10519 : % are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.
10520 : A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.
10521 : Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.
10522 : You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.
10523 : Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.
10524 : Which would you like to ask about? Abilities. Temperament. Weather preferences. Nothing.
10525 : Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.
10526 : For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.
10527 : Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.
10528 : But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.
10529 : The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.
10530 : Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.
10531 : Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.
10532 : Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.
10533 : You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.
10534 : After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.
10535 : When your chocobo retires, you will receive %. Be sure not to lose it.
10536 : You can use the % to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.
10537 : The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!
10538 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.
10539 : You will need % and % if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.
10540 : You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them %.
10541 : I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.
10542 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using %.
10543 : You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.
10544 : That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.
10545 : When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade % to a VCS member.
10546 : Also, the %'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.
10547 : If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.
10548 : What would you like to ask about? %. Chococards. %. Nothing.
10549 : % proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.
10550 : With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.
10551 : If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!
10552 : You can use % to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.
10553 : The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.
10554 : Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get %, so good luck with that...
10555 : Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.
10556 : If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.
10557 : Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.
10558 : If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade % to a VCS member.

10734 : should be able to sleep well with this.
10735 : Thanks to the %,  has been sleeping soundly at night.

11436 : I've got your % right here. You can have it now.
11437 : You lost your %?
11438 : Well, I guess I'll have to get another one from Hantileon. It's going to cost you # gil, though.
11439 : This item links you and  together. You would be wise not to lose it again.
11440 : It looks like you're taking good care of this. There seems to be no problem.
11441 : This %'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak.
11442 : I can give you a new % in exchange for it if you wish.
11443 : Here you go. Take good care of it.
11444 : All right... You can have this back, then.
11445 : Here, let me give you a new % in exchange for this old one.
11446 : And don't worry about the usual fee. The % is all I'll be needing from you this time.
11447 : I still have not given your chocobo its food, so I will return it to you.
11448 : Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. Please wait until it awakens before feeding it.
11449 : Your chocobo has run away. Please wait until it returns and then feed it.
11450 : Your chocobo has not hatched, so you cannot feed it yet.
11451 : Alright. Let's give  its food.
11452 : I hope it gets well soon.
11453 : I hope we can make this animal into a fine chocobo!
11454 : I hope your chocobo awakens soon.
11455 : Ah, %! I've been waiting for you. You can have this.
11456 : To enter your current chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you will require %.
11457 : You need only trade it to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
11458 : Hi, %! What's all this about?
11459 : I see... So it was wandering around lost, was it? Poor thing.
11460 : %, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.
11461 : I'm sure its owner is searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.
11462 : If you find anything, have a chat to Kiria-Romaria over there.
11463 : %, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I've been collecting information, too!
11464 : The owner's name starts with the letter [ / / / /G/ /K/P].
11465 : The owner is [/ / / / / / / /a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra].
11466 : The owner is [ / / / / /a guild worker/someone affiliated with one of the ministries/a hunter/an adventurer].
11467 : I'll do my own searching when I have the time. I hope we manage to find something.
11468 : I've got new information on the owner of the lost chick!
11469 : That's all I could find! The rest is up to you!
11470 : The chick's owner came and picked it up not long ago. I'm glad we found its rightful home.
11471 : I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.
11472 : Oh dear... You see, that name violates VCS naming conventions. You'll have to choose another one, I'm afraid.
11473 : First, we must test the level of trust between you and .
11474 : Chocobos have a habit of hiding things that they consider valuable.
11475 : I'm sure even  hides things while you are not around...
11476 : Find an item it has hidden and bring it to me.
11477 : If you and  really have a trusting relationship, I'm sure you will be able to find something.
11478 : is completely absorbed in its current activities.
11479 : What will you do? Search for the chocobo's item. Watch over the chocobo.
11480 : You find something in the ground.
11481 : You obtain %!
11482 : There does not seem to be anything of particular notice here.
11483 : Kweh!
11484 : appears to be very happy.
11485 : Kweh!!!
11486 : noticed what you were doing...
11487 : You gave this to  when it was still a chick, didn't you?
11488 : It looks like  held the item very dear. Your bond with your chocobo seems very strong.
11489 : I have no qualms about entrusting you with this now.
11490 : One of the workers at our stable gave this to  when it was still a chick, right?
11491 : seems to trust the stables' employees more than you...
11492 : At least you were able to find it, though... Here. You can have this.
11493 : Your egg feels the tender warmth of your gaze.
11494 : The chick inside the egg seems to want out...
11495 : The chick inside the egg seems to be anxious to meet you...
11496 : looks happy to see you.
11497 : doesn't look very happy...
11498 : is in high spirits.
11499 : looks irritated.
11500 : is sleeping peacefully.
11501 : You feel a faint warmth in the room left behind by ...
11502 : Now feeding the chocobo...

11521 : has found something!
11522 : seems interested in your story.
11523 : Which would you like to talk about? Random chitchat. An impatient chocobo. A curious chocobo. A worrisome chocobo. A youthful chocobo. A happy chocobo. A diligent chocobo.
11524 : learns the ability Gallop!
11525 : learns the ability Canter!
11526 : learns the ability Burrow!
11527 : learns the ability Bore!

11529 : learns the ability Treasure Finder!
11530 : doesn't seem to understand your story...
11531 : is inspired by your story.
11532 : hangs its head in shame.
11533 : awakens from its sleep.
11534 : is still fast asleep...
11535 : Don't feel too bad when you lose... You never stood a chance anyway!
11536 : W-wow... You're pretty fast!
11537 : Th-this is absurd...
11538 : You're lucky our chocobo wasn't feeling that well today. You would be eating our dust any other time!
11539 : This would never have happened if Bashraf hadn't been telling the chocobo those foolish stories...
11540 : That's not true! The chocobo always looked very interested in what I had to say!
11541 : I'm sure your chocobo would be, too. You should give it a try sometime!
11542 : Now have you learned never to underestimate ?
11543 : This baby's going to earn us a mint at the races! As for you...at this rate, you'll need all the luck you can get to even earn the right to compete with me!
11544 : It's a tie!
11545 : Hey, your chocobo isn't half bad...
11546 : Hmph. If  had only been feeling up to it, we would have been here hours ago!
11547 : Luck was simply not with us today...
11548 : Well, hello there! You're out on a walk with your chocobo today, too?
11549 : Your chocobo is adorable, isn't it? It should get along with  just fine!
11550 : Cheep!
11551 : Keh!
11552 : Kweh!
11553 : becomes friends with !
11554 : Oh, you're out walkin' your chocobo, too?
11555 : Mighty fine specimen ya got there. Let's see how well it gets along with  here...
11556 : You're out on a walk with your chocobo, too?
11557 : Nice-looking chocobo. Let's see how well it gets along with %...
11558 : Good day to you, [Sir/Ma'am]! Fine day to walk a chocobo.
11559 : I must say, that is a fine specimen. I am curious to see how it would get along with my ...
11560 : Hey! You're raising a chocobo, too?
11561 : Take a look at our chocobo. Is it not a splendid creature?
11562 : What'd you mean, why are all three of us raising one chocobo? Like an amateur would understand!
11563 : We're aiming to raise the best of the best...the creme de la creme of all chocobos!
11564 : Bashraf is fostering its psychological state.
11565 : Foudeel is working on its intelligence.
11566 : And I'm making it the strongest chocobo in Vana'diel!
11567 : Brilliant, right? What better way to raise a perfect animal than to divide the tasks and focus on each aspect wholeheartedly?
11568 : Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but our chocobo is far superior to yours.
11569 : Do you not agree? Surely you would not have the nerve to suggest that your chocobo is...dare I say...better than ours?
11570 : But if you insist, a simple race will make the difference in quality quite clear. Try it if you still have any complaints, and may the best chocobo win.
11571 : Hey, I remember you!
11572 : I'm glad you're taking the time to take  out for fresh air. Keep up the good work!
11573 : Oh, there you are!
11574 : Glad to see you're taking  out on walks! Keep it up!
11575 : Well, what a coincidence.
11576 : I'm glad to see that you're taking  outside every now and then. Keep up the good work.
11577 : Well, well! Fine meeting you here, %.
11578 : I am pleased to see that you are taking  outside every now and then. I hope you continue the fine work.
11579 : You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo!
11580 : Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important!
11581 : Let me teach you a story that I often recite to my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too!
11582 : You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo...
11583 : Don't forget just how important regular communication with your chocobo is.

11593 : Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with . Keep it up.
11594 : Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with . Keep it up.
11595 : Well, hello! I haven't seen you in forever. Is that your own chocobo?
11596 : Ever since you showed me the error of my ways, I've been goin' to meet my old chocobo practically every day now. I know Brutus's takin' good care of him, but I just can't help but wonder how he's doing.
11597 : Today when I went to the stables, Brutus was just about to take him out on a walk.
11598 : But when he saw me, he came runnin' over!
11599 : It looked like he wanted me to take him out...
11600 : Kweh!
11601 : Anyway, I'm glad he's happy. Don't you make the same mistakes I did, now.
11602 : Cheep!
11603 : Kwee!
11604 : Kweh!
11605 : Cheep.
11606 : The chocobo appears to be lost...
11607 : The chocobo chick appears to be lost...
11608 : What will you do? Bring it home. Leave it.
11609 : Cheep...
11610 : The chocobo chick follows %...
11611 : You look like you have something you want to ask. What do you want?
11612 : The owner of a lost chick? Hm... This is just a hunch, but...
11613 : Not long ago, I saw someone walking a chick.

11618 : I thought about it a while, and remembered something else...
11619 : It's been on my mind, but I haven't been able to remember anything else yet.
11620 : You look like you have something you would like to ask. Is there something wrong?
11621 : I see... So, you are searching for the owner of a lost chick? This is simply conjecture, but...
11622 : I saw somebody walking a chick not too long ago.

11651 : Ask if this person is the chick's owner? Yes. No.
11652 : appears to have found something.
11653 : You see something half-buried under the straw. Could it be %...?
11654 : You find something on the floor of the chocobo stall. Could it be %...?
11655 : Ah, it appears your chocobo found this during one of your walks.
11656 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
11657 : Looks like your chocobo found this on one of your walks.
11658 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
11659 : It seems your chocobo found this on one of your walks.
11660 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
11661 : Obtained: %!
11662 : Inventory is full. % could not obtain the %.
11663 : Could not trade the % and %. Please try again.
11664 : Hear the report? Hear a detailed report. Hear a brief report. Skip the report. I'm done here.
11665 : Are you sure? Yes. No.
11666 : Continue the report? Please do. I've heard enough.
11667 : Skip all remaining reports? No. Yes.
11668 : One moment please...
11669 : Choose the pace for your [short walk/regular walk/long walk]. Leisurely. Brisk. Cancel.
11670 : Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.
11671 : I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.
11672 : Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess % or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.
11673 : How about you, [sir/ma'am]?
11674 : If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in [Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.
11675 : What do you say? Tell me more. Sign me up! Not today.
11676 : Congratulations, %! You are now an official member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
11677 : I see. Please come back if you ever change your mind!
11678 : What would you like to know? Why race chocobos, anyway? How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kind of races are there? What are racing teams? Quit. Return.
11679 : Why not!? Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.
11680 : We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A win-win situation, as we like to call it in the business.
11681 : However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...
11682 : The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.
11683 : And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.
11684 : Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!
11685 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
11686 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
11687 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
11688 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
11689 : Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.
11690 : Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.
11691 : In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.
11692 : Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.
11693 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
11694 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
11695 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
11696 : There are two main types of races.
11697 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
11698 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
11699 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
11700 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
11701 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.
11702 : You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)
11703 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
11704 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
11705 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
11706 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
11707 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
11708 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
11709 : Ah, it says here that you are a member of the [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
11710 : Have you come today to change your affiliation?
11711 : Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
11712 : Join this team? Yes. No.
11713 : Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
11714 : Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.
11715 : Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.
11716 : What do we have here...
11717 : %:
11718 : Alright, %, I will store this in our safe.
11719 : Alright, %, I will store these in our safe.
11720 : I am sorry, but you have already brought me one of those.
11721 : I am sorry, but you have already brought me these items.
11722 : Hello! What might I interest you in today?
11723 : (You have # [chocobuck/chocobucks].) Chocobo [registration/confirmation]. Item confirmation. Free run (# gil). Official race (# [chocobuck/chocobucks]). Re-run. Rule confirmation. Nothing.
11724 : (You have # [chocobuck/chocobucks].) Chocobo [registration/confirmation]. Item confirmation. Free run (# gil). Official race. Re-run. Rule confirmation. Nothing.
11725 : You cannot access this menu until you have registered a chocobo to race.
11726 : To register your chocobo, you must first bring me either % or %.
11727 : You can only register one chocobo at a time, but you may always register a new one whenever you wish.
11728 : We currently hold for you:  %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Quit. Return.
11729 : With newly developed CRA technology, you can now relive the excitement of a previously cleared official race!

11987 : What would you like to know about? Racing teams. Race rules. Race types. Victory points. Race Progression. That's about it.
11988 : A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.
11989 : Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.
11990 : In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.
11991 : For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.
11992 : The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.
11993 : What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.
11994 : Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.
11995 : Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.
11996 : The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.
11997 : The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.
11998 : The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.
11999 : In such an event, the less endowed of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.
12000 : Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.
12001 : Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the race grade.
12002 : For example, a C4 Chocobo Race would indicate a typical grade 4 race.
12003 : We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.
12004 : No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.
12005 : Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.
12006 : As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.
12007 : Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.
12008 : Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.
12009 : Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.
12010 : The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.
12011 : As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.
12012 : Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.
12013 : We have a total of four races that run in succession.
12014 : Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.
12015 : Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.
12016 : Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!
12017 : What would you like to hear more about? Race preparations. Signup procedure. Collecting winnings. Signing up for another race. I'm fine, thanks.
12018 : There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.
12019 : First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.
12020 : Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a race chocobo, for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.
12021 : Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...
12022 : All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.
12023 : A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.
12024 : Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.
12025 : There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.
12026 : There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.
12027 : Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given %, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.
12028 : In the event that you should lose or misplace your %, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.
12029 : The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!
12030 : You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.
12031 : To collect, simply hand in the % you received during race signup at any signup center.
12032 : The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.
12033 : You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.
12034 : After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
12035 : This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.
12036 : We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.
12037 : What would you like to ask? What is chocobetting? How do I bet? What are odds? When do I bet? How do I collect winnings? Nothing.
12038 : Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.
12039 : To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.
12040 : Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.
12041 : For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.
12042 : And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.
12043 : Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.
12044 : The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!
12045 : To place a chocobet, you must obtain % from the chocobet center.
12046 : For any single %, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.
12047 : We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.
12048 : Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.
12049 : Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.
12050 : It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.
12051 : What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.
12052 : Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.
12053 : The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.
12054 : Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.
12055 : Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.
12056 : Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.
12057 : Once the race is finished, you can exchange your % at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.
12058 : Without % you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.
12059 : % is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.
12060 : Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.

12115 : Greetings, and welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service area is here to accommodate our more experienced and accomplished racers.
12116 : I am truly sorry [sir/ma'am], but we are unable to service your request here. This service area only caters to [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] CRA Classic winners.
12117 : Registration for such an event can be carried out at the service areas for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
12118 : The organizing attendants in each location are as follows: [Southern San d'Oria: Alangriche/Bastok Mines: Jazgeh/Windurst Waters: Turumi-Byrumi] [Northern San d'Oria: Monteverle/Bastok Markets: Galienne/Windurst Port: Lhimo Keanyohn] [Port San d'Oria: Ramiene/Port Bastok: Salvador/Windurst Woods: Rungaga].
12119 : For beginning and intermediate races, you'll want to speak with [Alangriche/Jazgeh/Rungaga].
12120 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
12121 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for advanced and veteran racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
12122 : Which would you like to hear about? CRA rationale behind veteran races. How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kinds of races are there? What are racing teams? What about race opponents? Quit. Return.
12123 : With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.
12124 : As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!
12125 : The Monster Races!
12126 : Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing!
12127 : Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele. What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?
12128 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
12129 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
12130 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
12131 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
12132 : Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!
12133 : The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal. It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.
12134 : Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern. If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.
12135 : Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area. Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.
12136 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
12137 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
12138 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
12139 : There are two main types of races.
12140 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
12141 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
12142 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
12143 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
12144 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.
12145 : You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Thank you for your understanding.
12146 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
12147 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
12148 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
12149 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
12150 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
12151 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
12152 : Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.
12153 : We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence. The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.
12154 : Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits. And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.
12155 : As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind. It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack. Consider yourself warned.
12156 : In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well. Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part. It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!
12157 : Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed. These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.
12158 : Dueler's Race Participants: 2 Objective: Place 1st
12159 : And now, Markovich's undeniably unorthodox, and arguably downright unethical, monster race is about to begin!
12160 : Survival Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
12161 : Following such a fine showing in the Dueler's Race, the next contest is about to start! Who will be the last beast standing?
12162 : Deadly Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
12163 : Warning! The next race contains monsters of unprecedented nastiness. Enter at your own risk! The name says it all!
12164 : Mystery Race Participants: 4 chocobos & 4 ??? Objective: Place 1st
12165 : What's this? We've been asked to pass along yet another challenge, this time from an anonymous source! I'm not altogether clear on what is about to transpire...
12166 : Lethal Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
12167 : The games are over, ladies and gentlemen. Markovich is laying it all on the table. Here come his most ferocious beasts to date!
12168 : Dream Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
12169 : This is the moment you've all been waiting for. The CRA has brought its racing elite out from the stables! The treacherous offroad track is fraught with perils! And an absolutely awe-inspiring trophy is ready for the winner! Bragging rights for life are on the line!

12218 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.
12219 : Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...
12220 : ...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.
12221 : Good day, fol--
12223 : Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.
12224 : Alrighty then, our next race features # of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.
12225 : First we have , who will be ridden by [the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing allstar, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].
12227 : She says, When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.
12228 : She says, And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' allstar!
12229 : She says, This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.
12230 : She says, There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.
12231 : She says, This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.
12232 : She says, Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.
12233 : She says, This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.
12234 : She says, This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'
12235 : Next we have [Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by [the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].
12236 : Sakura says, Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!
12237 : Sakura says, This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.
12238 : Sakura says, Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.
12239 : Our next chocobo is [Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by [Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].
12240 : Sakura says, Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.
12241 : Sakura says, She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.
12243 : Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...
12244 : The next contestant is [Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by [chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].
12245 : She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.
12246 : She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.
12247 : She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.
12248 : And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.
12249 : And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?
12250 : The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.
12251 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
12252 : And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
12253 : ...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!
12254 : Good day, fol--
12256 : Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.
12257 : And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!
12258 : ##:  ##:  ##:  ##:
12259 : And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
12260 : Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
12261 : I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.
12262 : Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!
12263 : Yeah... Good luck, %...
12264 : Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.
12265 : And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, [Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].
12266 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'
12267 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.
12268 : Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.
12269 : They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.
12270 : Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell [him/her], Wahboud!
12271 : Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!
12272 : As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.
12273 : %. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.
12274 : Good luck, %. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!
12275 : Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!
12276 : And next we have [Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by [VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].
12278 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.
12279 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.
12280 : Sakura says, Big things often come in small packages.
12281 : Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--
12282 : a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!
12283 : This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.
12284 : Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!
12285 : It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted piece de resistance?
12286 : We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.
12287 : Well, there you have it.
12288 : Now let's take a look at today's participants...
12289 : Ladies and gentlemen! President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...
12290 : ...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!
12291 : Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.
12292 : Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?
12293 : Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?
12294 : Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--
12295 : The Rakapopo Cup!
12296 : Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Kupipi!
12297 : So, I've learned that you have entered your very own personal chocobo in the cup. What do you think her chances are of taking home the grand prize?
12298 : Are you making fun of me, sir!? Well, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my gutty-wutty when my Starlight sails across the finish line years before the nearest competitaru!
12299 : Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.
12300 : My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!
12301 : [Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing allstar/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Never heard of [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!
12302 : We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one Kamp Kweh. We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.
12303 : Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...
12304 : Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take more than an embiggened brainy-wainy to beat Starlight!
12305 : What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.
12306 : Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...
12307 : Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fan! I won't let Starlight lose to some imposter!
12308 : Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called reincarnate's redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!
12309 : Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?
12310 : Hah! Well, I have been riding chocobos for twenty-one years!
12311 : And next is [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by [San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!
12312 : Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.
12313 : Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...
12314 : Both Starlight and the professor hate to take orders... Maybe that's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!
12315 : The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.
12316 : When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.
12317 : When the professor's not stumbling over his speech impediment-ethy, he's researching the intricacies of chocobo behavioral patterns.
12318 : And they're off!
12319 : Markovich, what did you think of the start?
12320 : Well, I fel--
12322 : Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
12323 : Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
12324 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
12325 : And as they pass the halfway mark...
12326 : ##  holds on to the lead!
12327 : # different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!
12328 : While from behind the pack, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
12329 : While from behind, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
12330 : All # chocobos battle for the lead!
12331 : Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
12332 : And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
12334 : Sakura says, The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.
12335 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
12336 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
12337 : Incredible! 's speed is approaching dangerous limits!
12338 : It looks like  is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!
12339 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
12340 : 's speed has begun to drop off!
12341 : It looks like  has begun to tire!
12342 : The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
12343 : The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
12344 : The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
12345 : The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
12346 : The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for !?
12347 : Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for !?
12348 : And yet  seems completely unaffected by the attack!
12349 : And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
12350 : And now they're approaching the final corner!
12351 : ##  still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
12352 : It's crowded up front with # chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
12353 : ##  is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
12354 : It's crowded up front with all # chocobos still fighting for the lead!
12355 : The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
12356 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ##  today!
12357 : And  takes the crown!
12358 : What's this? ##  is making its move on the lead!
12359 : And it's  by a beak!!!
12360 : Let's take a look at the results...
12361 : #:  (##)
12362 : There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!
12363 : Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.
12364 : Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.
12365 : Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.
12366 : What an amazing race! The other chocobos were no match for [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?
12367 : What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?
12368 : [Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!
12369 : The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.
12370 : Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!
12371 : Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...
12372 : Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exactly as I expected!
12373 : The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no way Starlight could lose! Her horoscope said so!
12374 : And there you have it. This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!
12375 : And now, let's see the results from the last race.
12376 : #:  (##)
12377 : And that's all she wrote, folks!
12378 : The winnings for a #-# bet come to # gil per quill!
12379 : Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
12380 : She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
12381 : She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
12382 : Until next time, race fans...
12383 : Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.
12384 : Taking the crown for today's race was none other than !
12385 : To the winning steed's owner we present the %, %, and the exalted title of Rocochookie, I mean, Chocorookie!
12386 : And to the ambitious and sporting %, we present this undeniably useful %!
12387 : Good show, %. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.
12388 : Excellent race, %! You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.
12389 : Okay, maybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I still think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!
12390 : Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.
12391 : But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.

12405 : With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...
12406 : Oh...? Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?
12407 : I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.
12408 : Is that so...? Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...
12409 : Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone. You of all people should know that the show must go on!
12410 : Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own baby will be taking the field!
12411 : Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!
12412 : But of course! I had forgotten all about it! Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you! Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!
12413 : But that's not where it ends! There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?
12414 : A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself. Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?
12415 : It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.
12416 : Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state! But...
12417 : But...?
12418 : I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.
12419 : I see... Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?
12420 : You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo. Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?
12421 : But enough talking, I say. It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!
12422 : Oh, yes, right... Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay! It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!
12423 : In the chocobo corner, we have , undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.
12424 : Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo? I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.
12425 : 's formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, a wolf in sheep's clothing!
12426 : I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!
12427 : I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?
12428 : Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that monsters like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.
12429 : Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!
12430 : With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!
12431 : Whoopee! Bring them on, I say!
12432 : Erm...yes... Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.
12433 : Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.
12434 : Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki! Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.
12435 : Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo. I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.
12436 : And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!
12437 : My, oh my...! I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--
12438 : A-ahem! I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.
12439 : All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies! Well done, my pretty! Well done!
12440 : It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders... <Sniffle>
12441 : Next in the lineup is Sakura. ...!? What on Vana'diel!?
12442 : Hrmmm... Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
12443 : Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...
12444 : What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man! There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!
12445 : Um, yes... Please forgive me...
12446 : And won't you look at the lineup! This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks? I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?
12447 : And with me today is our regular guest commentator...
12448 : Huh? Why isn't Markovich here?
12449 : Ohohohohohoho! You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.
12450 : <Gulp> You...you're that mage from Windurst...
12451 : ...Professor Shantotto!
12452 : If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich, as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.
12453 : Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence, four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.
12454 : So if you care to hear out my little proposal, these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.
12455 : With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice... Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?
12456 : With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused? Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.
12457 : First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.
12458 : Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold. I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.
12459 : Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.
12460 : Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word failure. Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.
12461 : Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.
12462 : Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable. If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.
12463 : Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!
12464 : For Ace of Trophies, championship contender is an unfitting description. Even consecutive champion would not be too high an expectation.
12465 : Um...Professor Shantotto... Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?
12466 : Ohohohohoho! Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so. But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!
12467 : Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage. Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.
12468 : Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview. So let the race begin, without further ado!
12469 : Ohohohohohoho! Of this inevitable result, I was always assured-- that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!
12470 : The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor. But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.
12471 : H-hey! What do you think you're trying to pull here!?
12472 : My, my, what a pleasant surprise! I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.
12473 : How dare you ohoho your way into my hard-earned commentary seat! This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!
12474 : Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification. I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.
12475 : And you, Goccilo! What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!
12476 : Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing! Until next time...!
12477 : %, I knew you'd make it all the way here.
12478 : What's with the baffled expression? It's me, Sakura.
12479 : You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird. I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.
12480 : I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.
12481 : I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...
12482 : And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.
12483 : I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.
12484 : Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.
12485 : I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.
12486 : I hope that'll be your chocobo, %!
12487 : And next, we have Sakura. But something seems to be different... Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.
12488 : She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!
12489 : The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.
12490 : I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround! A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.
12491 : And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.
12492 : It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.
12493 : And that completes the lineup, folks. With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!
12494 : You find %.
12495 : Welcome to the Dream Race, %.
12496 : I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.
12497 : I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.
12498 : I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.
12499 : But no more... If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.
12500 : This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.
12501 : I won't hold back in today's race, %.
12502 : Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.
12503 : Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.
12504 : I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?
12505 : Next, we have Sakura...
12506 : Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!? This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!
12507 : Well I'll be... In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!
12508 : ...
12509 : Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks. For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?
12510 : %, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded %, %, and the exalted title of Chocochampion!
12511 : Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far! Congratulations!
12512 : Great race, %. It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.
12513 : But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come.. With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...
12514 : Princess... Princess Sakura!
12515 : Princess...? What are you talking about? Who are you?
12516 : Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion. I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.
12517 : Searching for...me?
12518 : Yes, Your Highness. You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.
12519 : Are you serious!? Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?
12520 : That is correct. Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.
12521 : D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?
12522 : ...! I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...
12523 : Wh...what happened?
12524 : You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world. You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...
12525 : She...she gave up her life to save me?
12526 : Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again. But, I never once gave up hope...
12527 : My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.
12528 : So that's what happened...
12529 : Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos!
12530 : ...
12531 : I'm sorry, but I can't go.
12532 : Your Highness! But...why!?
12533 : Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like %'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.
12534 : What's more...
12535 : I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...
12536 : I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.
12537 : What...?
12538 : The only place I belong is here, beside you.
12539 : And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer? I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?
12540 : I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!
12541 : Heehee! Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!
12542 : %, I'm looking forward to our rematch! Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?
12543 : You're still here, eh, %?
12544 : Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?
12545 : What? How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?
12546 : Hohoho... It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.
12547 : I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...
12548 : Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos? No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.
12549 : Sakura is the queen, you say?
12550 : <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises. But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.
12551 : You know what they say: Home is where the heart is. To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.
12552 : And you, our new Chocochampion! Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.
12553 : Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today. These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.
12554 : And they're off!
12555 : Hrmmm! [Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
12556 : Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
12557 : All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance. But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
12558 : Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
12559 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
12560 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
12561 : The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
12562 : The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
12563 : And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
12564 : It's crowded up front with # contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
12565 : It's crowded up front with all # contestants still fighting for the lead!
12566 : The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
12567 : What's this!?  has used %!
12568 : still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
12569 : is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
12570 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching  today!
12571 : What's this?  is making its move on the lead!
12572 : #:
12573 : What's this!? 's using [Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!
12574 : Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those [monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!
12575 : just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed! And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
12576 : I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about 's step.  And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!
12577 : And here's some unexpected drama, folks! The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
12578 : Look at that! 's stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!
12579 : Uh-oh, what's going on here!? The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
12580 : Oooh! In a bold move,  has just used a [Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!
12581 : What's this!? All of the chocobos other than  and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
12582 : Thanks to that brazen little act,  can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks! That just might seal the deal for !
12583 : Never in all my days, race fans! In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
12584 : How could my creation make such a rookie mistake? In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
12585 : Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
12586 : The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
12587 : The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
12588 : The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
12589 : Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!? What in the world do you think you're doing!?
12590 : Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame. This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
12591 : What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today? I've heard it being said that today's [creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal. This could get heavy, folks!
12592 : All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them. Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
12593 : It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
12594 : There's still plenty of race to go, race fans! More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
12595 : And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
12596 : The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now. This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
12597 : This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent. Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
12598 : And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty! Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
12599 : And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them! But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
12600 : I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call! Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
12601 : It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now! The time for a final spurt is now or never!
12602 : And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
12603 : You see a single, ivory venture roll die on the table. There are currently #/# other players wishing to participate.
12604 : What would you like to do? Join table (# gil). Leave. Read manual.
12605 : There are currently #/# players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)
12606 : You place # gil in the pot.
12607 : The final participant has arrived. Your group is allowed # [minute/minutes] at the table.
12608 : %'s primary roll is #!
12609 : Double up? (Currently: #) Yes. No.
12610 : % doubles up... Your venture roll total is now #!
12611 : % doubles up... BUST!!!
12612 : % holds fast.
12613 : Double up complete.
12614 : Results...
12615 : %'s final total is #!
12616 : % has gone BUST!
12617 : The game has ended in a draw!
12618 : The winner is %!
12619 : Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.
12620 : The final place at the table has already been taken.
12621 : You do not have enough gil.
12622 : Someone has dropped the die!
12623 : Read which chapter? 1. The Heart of Venture Roll. 2. Rules of the Roll. 3. Putting the Book Down.
12624 : Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.
12625 : Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (doubling up) as many times as the table time limit allows (# [minute/minutes], Earth time).
12626 : In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (hold fast).
12627 : If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.
12628 : Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).
12629 : Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.
12630 : If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a draw and all participation fees are repaid in full.
12631 : Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.
12632 : That look in your eyes... I sense the fear of one frightful femme fatale flowing forth from your soul... Don't tell me... You're one of Salaheem's Sentinels!
12633 : Which means, I am allowed to provide you with this special offer!
12634 : For a small fee, I can teleport you directly to Aht Urhgan Whitegate!
12635 : Simply trade me # gil, and you'll be sipping chai with [mysterious veiled beauties/bronzed, battle-hardened warriors] before the hour is up.
12636 : Thank you very much, [sir/ma'am].
12637 : Now let us be off!
12638 : Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those [San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!
12639 : Congratulations on your victory, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!
12640 : Where would like to go, kupo? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
12641 : Happy travels, kupo!
12642 : Moogles from across Vana'diel have heard of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!
12643 : Oooh! It's %! Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!
12644 : ***GM Commands*** ***Use with CAUTION!***
12645 : Set this area's A flag to: Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
12646 : Switch on this area's B flag? No (OFF). Yes (ON).
12647 : Flag settings complete. A Flag: [Nowhere/San/Bas/Win] B Flag: [OFF/ON]
12648 : The previous Adventurer Appreciation Campaign was a resounding success, kupo! However, there were a lot of people who didn't have the opportunity to collect their %.
12649 : It wouldn't be fair if those poor souls missed out on such an incredible item, so I've brought a whole new bag of them!
12650 : Ah, but my list shows that you already received a ring. I'm sorry, %. I am not allowed to give you a new one, kupo!
12651 : Hrmmm... It looks like you weren't registered with the MHMU at the time of the campaign. I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to give newcomers a ring.
12652 : Oh, and my list shows that you haven't received % yet, kupo! Here, you can have this one, but be careful not to throw it away, as you'll never be able to get another...ever!
12653 : Hey! The MHMU has a basketful of special goodies for all the brave adventurers who work hard to protect the poor little moogles of Vana'diel, kupo.
12654 : Oh, and your name is on my list, %! Let me show you the items you can choose from...
12655 : Choose wisely... Never mind. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12656 : Hey! The MHMU has a basketful of special goodies for all the brave adventurers who work hard to protect the poor little moogles of Vana'diel, kupo. Ah, but it looks like I have nothing for you! Sorry!
12657 : The MHMU appreciates your sustained support! May you use our present for productive purposes, kupo!
12658 : Should you get your mighty mitts on anything like %, make it known by trading them to me. I'll give you a great gift in return, kupo.
12659 : So you've deemed it time to trade in a ticket-like %, huh? For what exemplars of enjoyment will you exchange it, kupo?
12660 : What do you want in exchange? Nothing. Equipment. Items. Currency.
12661 : What equipment? Never mind. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Previous page. Next page.
12662 : What item? None. %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) Previous page. Next page.

12665 : You sure you're perfectly pleased with %, kupo?
12666 : You sure you're perfectly pleased with # %, kupo?
12667 : Are you completely confident you want # [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes/Bayld/Fishermen's Guild points/Carpenters' Guild points/Blacksmiths' Guild points/Goldsmiths' Guild points/Weavers' Guild points/Tanners' Guild points/Boneworkers' Guild points/Alchemists' Guild points/Culinarians' Guild points], kupo?

12677 : Unfortunately, to keeps their secret, thosea guys always breaks the goods up into four pieces.

12687 : Whaddo I look like here, a charity?
12688 : It looks like something is buried here. If you had % you could dig it up.
12689 : You dig up a strange wooden casket!
12690 : But your % breaks in the process.
12691 : You find % in the box!
12692 : You find # gil in the box!
12693 : Obtained: %.
12694 : Obtained # gil.
12695 : Your inventory is full. You cannot carry any more items.
12696 : You must be closer to the spot to dig.
12697 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
12698 : Kupopopo... You do realize what we're selling here, don't you?
12699 : Whatever could they be selling? %. %.
12700 : If you looked up the entry for wrong answer in an encyclopedia, that's exactly what would appear, kupo!
12701 : You can purchase your  tickets here, kupo.
12702 : What would you like to do? Purchase ticket. Learn about prizes. Learn about the [Mog Bonanza/Nomad Mog Bonanza]. Nothing.
12703 : The Mog Bonanza is a number guessing game, kupo.
12704 : The player selects a number between 0 and #. This number is then recorded on %, which can be purchased for # gil, kupo.

12707 : Trade me % that has a winning number, and I'll give you a prize in exchange.

12854 : Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
12855 : I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain %.
12856 : Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
12857 : May I be of service? Not now. Learn recipes. Check fewell. Replenish fewell. Purchase materials. Receive training. Trade cinder. Get information.
12858 : Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
12859 : ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.

12879 : There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
12880 : But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your % for a moment...
12881 : Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: # # # # # # # #.
12882 : Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
12883 : Replenish fewell? Yes. No.
12884 : Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
12885 : ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
12886 : Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for # gil.  How does that sound?
12887 : Pay # gil? Deal! No thanks.
12888 : Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
12889 : I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
12890 : Excellent! Now we just pop open your % here, and...
12891 : There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
12892 : Your % has been filled to capacity!
12893 : You hand the synergy engineer # gil.
12894 : How do you expect me to do that when your % is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
12895 : Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
12896 : Purchase something? Not today. # %: # gil. # ): # gil. # ): # gil.
12897 : For # %, that comes to # gil.
12898 : Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
12899 : ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
12900 : And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
12901 : Train in which technique? Cancel. Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: #) Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: #) Safety lever. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: #) Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: #)
12902 : You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
12903 : It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
12904 : Train in this technique? Yes. No.
12905 : Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
12906 : ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
12907 : ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
12908 : ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
12909 : <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
12910 : ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
12911 : Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level #!
12912 : Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
12913 : Trade in your cinder? (Currently: # Pz) Not now. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. # gil: # Pz.
12914 : This is what you want, correct?
12915 : Make the exchange? Yes. No.
12916 : It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
12917 : Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
12918 : You transferred # Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. # Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
12919 : Ask about what? Nothing. Synergy furnaces. Synergy overview. Synergy procedure. Synergy recipes. Fewell replenishment. Materials for sale. Synergy techniques. Trading cinder.
12920 : The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
12921 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
12922 : Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
12923 : Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
12924 : You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
12925 : Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
12926 : This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call fewell. To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
12927 : As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
12928 : With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
12929 : The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
12930 : But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
12931 : If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
12932 : Take heart, though, as any materials inside your % will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
12933 : Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
12934 : Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
12935 : Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
12936 : You may be asking yourself, Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?
12937 : Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
12938 : The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
12939 : Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of %, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
12940 : Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that % may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
12941 : Mind you, % is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
12942 : Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
12943 : First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
12944 : You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
12945 : Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
12946 : You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
12947 : From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
12948 : Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
12949 : Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
12950 : However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
12951 : If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
12952 : You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
12953 : The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
12954 : It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
12955 : This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
12956 : As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
12957 : For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
12958 : You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
12959 : In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
12960 : Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
12961 : If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
12962 : Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
12963 : What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
12964 : The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
12965 : ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
12966 : Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
12967 : Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
12968 : Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
12969 : The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
12970 : In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as % can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
12971 : % cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of % can then be embedded.
12972 : The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
12973 : If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
12974 : As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
12975 : You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
12976 : Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
12977 : My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
12978 : The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
12979 : Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
12980 : To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
12981 : When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
12982 : Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
12983 : Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
12984 : As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call fewell. The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
12985 : Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
12986 : To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
12987 : For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
12988 : That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your %! What could be easier?
12989 : Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of %? If so, you've come to the right place!
12990 : We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
12991 : Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
12992 : Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
12993 : Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
12994 : My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
12995 : Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
12996 : Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
12997 : Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
12998 : The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
12999 : Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
13000 : Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
13001 : We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
13002 : It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
13003 : Wondering if your % can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
13004 : A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
13005 : Congratulations! Your % can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A %-shaped aperture, to be exact...
13006 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: # / [///////].
13007 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
13008 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
13009 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
13010 : That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
13011 : Hmm... I'm afraid your % cannot house any more apertures.
13012 : ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your % cannot be etched.
13013 : Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your % cannot be etched at this time.
13014 : Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

13017 : View which recipe? ([Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice/Journeyman/Craftsman/Artisan/Adept/Veteran], p. #). None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Return to page selection. Previous page. Next page.
13018 : Oh, the %? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
13019 : Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
13020 : Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
13021 : Learn about synergy? Not today. Teach me! Just give me %.
13022 : A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
13023 : I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
13024 : Using % in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
13025 : What we call % serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
13026 : Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
13027 : Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your % into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
13028 : Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
13029 : Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
13030 : You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
13031 : But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
13032 : A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
13033 : That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
13034 : An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for %, you've certainly come to the right place.
13035 : I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for # gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
13036 : # gil, paid in full!
13037 : As promised, here's your %. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
13038 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
13039 : Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
13040 : Ah, you must be the one they call %. It's an honor to finally make your acquaintance.
13041 : My compatriot Joachim has told me much of your exploits. It'd be my pleasure to assist you any way I can.
13042 : Good day, %. Is there something you need?
13043 : What would like to ask about? I want %. Learn about %. Current % stock. Cavernous maw locations. Teleporting to a cavernous maw. Nothing right now.
13044 : All set for now, are we? I'll be right here if ever you have need of me.
13045 : Interested in the cavernous maws, are we?
13046 : La Theine Plateau, Konschtat Highlands, Tahrongi Canyon...
13047 : Jugner Forest, Valkurm Dunes, Buburimu Peninsula...
13048 : Xarcabard, North Gustaberg, South Gustaberg...
13049 : In these [zero/three/six/nine] areas gateway maws have manifested.
13050 : Planning a trip to Abyssea, I gather? You'd be wise to make a habit of taking stock of your % prior to departure.
13051 : The function of the % is twofold.
13052 : First and foremost, it's the key by which one gains entry to Abyssea.
13053 : Secondly, it serves as an anchor that secures one's essence to foreign dimensions.
13054 : A single stone is good for a #-minute (Earth time) jaunt in Abyssea, and up to # can be in your possession at any given time. Multiplying those two numbers will give you the limit of your stay.
13055 : One thing to remember is that a good twenty hours (Earth time) are required to fully charge one stone. As such, I might not always have one on hand. I must beg your patience in that case.
13056 : Here for your %? Let me see what I have for you...
13057 : Hm? Why, it appears you already have # stones. I'm sorry, %, but it'd be irresponsible of me to furnish you with any more. Heavens forbid I have a hand in stranding you in a foreign world.
13058 : Oh dear, I'm afraid I don't have any fully charged stones for you right now. Could you check back again in a while?
13059 : Here you are, %. That should suffice for the time being.
13060 : With the power of cruor, it's possible to teleport to any cavernous maw serving as a gateway to Abyssea. You only need to have visited that maw once before.
13061 : If you wish to go somewhere, a quick word with my assistant beside me here and you'll be off to your destination in the blinking of an eye.
13062 : It'll take me # more [minute/minutes] (Earth time) to fully charge another %.
13063 : You wish to know how many % I have for you? Why, that'd be # of them.
13064 : Obtained key item: # %!
13065 : Obtained key item: # %!
13066 : I'm sorry, but I don't believe we're acquainted. Please leave me be.
13067 : <Sigh>... To see such vistas of peace and prosperity restored to my homeland once more...
13068 : Greetings, friend of Abyssea. [/Ivan/Ernst/Kierron/Cyril/Willis/Vincent] is my name. My superior officer [/Gilburt/Erich/Jerrett/Adrian/Fabricius/Fabien] and I have been dispatched here to provide logistical support to allies of our cause.
13069 : As you endeavor to restore light to our ravaged world, so too will we endeavor to aid you in every possible way.
13070 : How might I assist you this day?
13071 : What would you like to ask about? My current cruor balance. Resistance outpost status. Teleporting to a cavernous maw. Nothing right now.
13072 : The figures in my logbook tell me you have # cruor to your name.
13073 : Ask about which area? Abyssea - Vunkerl. Abyssea - Misareaux. Abyssea - Attohwa. Never mind.
13074 : According to the latest intelligence reports...
13075 : This area's pulse martello defense rate presently stands at #%. The likelihood of an Abyssean horde invasion, on the other hand, is #%.
13076 : You wish to teleport to a cavernous maw? In that case, please tell me your precise destination.
13077 : Go to which area's gateway? Abyssea - La Theine. Abyssea - Konschtat. Abyssea - Tahrongi. Abyssea - Vunkerl. Abyssea - Misareaux. Abyssea - Attohwa. Abyssea - Altepa. Abyssea - Uleguerand. Abyssea - Grauberg. I've changed my mind.
13078 : # cruor is required for transport to the gateway to Abyssea - [La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Uleguerand/Grauberg].
13079 : Ah, it seems you have insufficient cruor to make that journey.
13080 : Will you proceed? (Cruor balance: #) Make it so. Make it no.
13081 : These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes. Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.
13082 : I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.
13083 : I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos. Would you be needing something of me?
13084 : Need something? Assist with replenishment. Assist with upgrades. Martellos? Come again? Nothing in particular.
13085 : Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort. To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these % into the structure.
13086 : Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and % at the same time.
13087 : Take along the %? Yes. No.
13088 : We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations. Best of luck in your efforts!
13089 : Why, is that not % already in your posssesion? You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.
13090 : I see that you currently possess %. Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?
13091 : You return the % and obtain % in its stead!
13092 : Your support is most heartening in these dark times. Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as %.
13093 : Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy. You will not be able to carry it and % at the same time.
13094 : Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better. Be careful out there!
13095 : Hm? Is that not % you hold in your hand? You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.
13096 : Is that % I see? Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?
13097 : Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that % off your hands. How did you fare in your efforts?
13098 : I see, I see... Martello #0#, you say? It sounds as if the operation was [a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]
13099 : The resistance greatly values your contributions. Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.
13100 : I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high. Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.
13101 : Ask something? So, what's a martello? Martello replenishment. Martello upgrades. Cautionary notes. Not now.
13102 : The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war. Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.
13103 : You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.
13104 : In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.
13105 : This % is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers. Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.
13106 : That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.
13107 : I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel. Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word. Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.
13108 : Feast your eyes on this %. She's a beauty, isn't she? Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.
13109 : An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations. Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.
13110 : Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex. As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.
13111 : % are quite large and unwieldy. Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and % at the same time.
13112 : Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.
13113 : 'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...
13114 : Warning: Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
13115 : Your % has been lost.
13116 : The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage. Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.
13117 : The % breaks!
13118 : Table: #
13119 : Very well, friend. Should you ever find yourself in need of assistance, do not hesitate to return.
13120 : Hail, soldier. I am a purveyor tasked with furnishing the brave men and women of the Voidwatch with essential supplies. My wares can be yours, provided you've got [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes] to trade. After all, we can't afford to let our limited resources go to waste in the hands of some unproven rookie.
13121 : Procure supplies? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Not now. % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#).
13122 : How many? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: #) None, actually. One (Cost: #). Three (Cost: #), Six (Cost: #). Nine (Cost: #). Twelve (Cost: #).
13123 : This % will cost you # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13124 : It seems you're short on [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing credits/Allied Notes], soldier. Come back when you've got a bit more seasoning under your belt.
13125 : Proceed? (Required [Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Yes. No.
13126 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13127 : % obtains # % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13128 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13129 : This % will cost you # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13130 : You already have %, and I'm not authorized to furnish you with another. Resources are in short supply. You'll have to make do with what you've already got.
13139 : How many? ( [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes]: #)
13140 : You may purchase up to # at a time.
13141 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
13142 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
13143 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
13144 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
13145 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
13146 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
13147 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
13148 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
13149 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
13150 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
13151 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
13152 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
13153 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
13154 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
13155 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
13156 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
13157 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
13158 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
13159 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
13160 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
13161 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
13162 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
13163 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
13164 : Deal, kupo? (Current gil: #). Check storable items. Deal. No deal.
13165 : The % will allow you to store the following items:
13166 : %.
13167 : %.
13168 : ...and that's all.
13169 : % (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
13170 : Warning! If you lose your % while storing a corresponding item, you will be forever unable to retrieve that item!
13171 : Is that % I see, kupo?
13172 : What will you do? Retrieve an item. Confirm storable items. Nothing.
13173 : Retrieve an item? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
13174 : Retrieve %? Retrieve it. Leave it.
13175 : You retrieve % from the porter moogle's care.
13176 : Kupo? I'm already taking care of that item for you.
13177 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
13178 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
13179 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
13180 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
13181 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
13182 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.
13183 : Why, it looks as if you have % located in your [inventory/Mog Safe/Mog Safe 2/Mog House storage/Mog Locker/Mog Satchel/Mog Sack/Mog Case/Mog Wardrobe/Mog Wardrobe 2/Mog Wardrobe 3/Mog Wardrobe 4/Mog Wardrobe 5/Mog Wardrobe 6/Mog Wardrobe 7/Mog Wardrobe 8/Recycle Bin]!

13193 : Merry Starlight! Come one, come all, and try your hand at the chocobo treasure chests!
13194 : Lately it's been really frigid outside, but with those hands warm and snug inside those fuzzy mittens, I'll bet you'll be seeking a more challenging level of competition!
13195 : What's your pleasure? Hear an explanation of the game. [Play/Play the simple version]. [/Play the advanced version.] I lost my synthesis materials. Not interested in playing, thank you.
13196 : The goal of this parlor game is to guess which treasure chests contain the baby chocobos.
13197 : I'll first show you which one has our little feathered friend.
13198 : Then it'll be your chance to guess after I give the boxes a quick shuffle.  If you're right, you win! If not, you lose.
13199 : In the advanced version, there are two chocobos instead of one for twice the feathery fun!
13200 : Each game costs # gil. Whaddya say?
13201 : Give it a go? (You currently have # gil.) Let's do this! Not right now.
13202 : Perfect!
13203 : Well, I suppose I do have some extra %... How does # gil for one sound?
13204 : Would you like to purchase this material? Yes. No.
13205 : So, where do you think it's hiding? [/(first)/(second)] The far left. [/(selected)] Second from the left. [/(selected)] Third from the left. [/(selected)] Fourth from the left. [/(selected)] Fifth from the left. [/(selected)] Stop playing.
13206 : Really stop playing? Yes. No.
13207 : Well done! I could tell you had an eye for this! Take this amazing prize!
13208 : Outstanding! It isn't every day you see someone up to the challenge! Here, you deserve this!
13209 : You won't be able to accomplish a thing with just that, however. To complete the synthesis, you need to collect two other items by traveling to the other nations.
13210 : Oh ho, wait just a moment! Looks like you've got the three things you need. Smash these babies together and see what splurts out!
13211 : Let me give you a little extra something for your hard work. Once you've synthesized an % and placed it in your Mog House, sit back, relax, and enjoy a tune or two.
13212 : Better luck next time, friend!
13213 : A bit out of your league, I suppose. No harm in trying again later, right?
13214 : Vague images of worlds beyond coalesce and diffuse within.
13215 : Enter the light? Take me now! Absolutely not!
13216 : Enter the light? Take me now! I'll dive in head first! Absolutely not!
13217 : Nothing happens...
13218 : I am elated that this lambent glow is apparent to thee. Your obvious lack of experience, however, causeth mine eyes to overflow with ruth.
13219 : I am elated that my lambent glow is apparent to thee. Visit my kinsman who dwelleth in the Pashhow Marshlands anon if thou yearnest for an experience like none other.
13220 : ...I am aware of thy mission. Thou art to provision me with %, %, or %.
13221 : Shouldst thy journey take thee to another nation, my kindred spirits in either [Northern San d'Oria/Port Bastok/Port Windurst] or [Northern San d'Oria/Port Bastok/Port Windurst] would also suffice.
13222 : May the winds blow thy way, adventurer.
13223 : ...And thus [he/she] arriveth.
13224 : I shan't cause thee teen. All I ask is that thou wearest this % upon thy finger and let thyself bathe in its luminescent emanations.
13225 : Wearest that % upon thy finger and let thyself bathe in its luminescent emanations.
13226 : Quotha...the light that shines forth from thy soul hath brightened a considerable degree.
13227 : Natheless, it remaineth but a dull glow akin to twitherym dust whenas compared to the blindingly refulgent souls of more accomplished combatants.
13228 : To fulfil thy true potential, thou needs assume the role of gladiator and bathe in monipulator blood.
13229 : As a monipulator, thou hast likely reduced opponents everywhere to bawling babes at the mere mention of thy name.
13230 : Simultaneously, though, combatants who hath cut swaths through adversaries while inside bestial vessels betimes yearneth for more...to bite the hand that feedeth.
13231 : A saga sung of those who instill terror and those who release the land from it... Bwahaha, a worthy tale of spiritual strife, forsooth.
13232 : Now that the stage hath been set, I shall impart the extent of my gladiatorial knowledge to thee. Simply ask and thou shalt receive.
13233 : What shall you ask about? Belligerency. Ranks. Prestige. Spoils. Domination. Nothing.
13234 : Those who have the ambition to slay monipulators can do battle against them by speaking with [me/my Northern San d'Orian ally] or one of my brethren in either [Port Bastok or Port Windurst/Northern San d'Oria or Port Windurst/Northern San d'Oria or Port Bastok] and receiving %.
13235 : This % is thy metaphorical muster as well as official avowal to enter belligerency.
13236 : While it doth provide myriad boons to thee, it preventeth not those outside thy coterie from interfering with thy duty. Such a benediction will only descend upon the yare souls who hath claimed monipulators as their prey.
13237 : I must also caution thee to beware that, depending on thy level of expertise, it may not behoove thee to tread upon the soils of certain lands.
13238 : Lastly, should thy bloodlust cease or resolve wither on the vine, speak to me and I shall grant thee permission to withdraw from belligerency.
13239 : Lastly, should thy bloodlust cease or resolve wither on the vine, speak to one of my compatriots and they shall grant thee permission to withdraw from belligerency.
13240 : Three ranks doth serve to classify the world's monipulator executioners. There is the eponymous gladiator (Gla), champion gladiator (CG), and high champion gladiator (HCG).
13241 : Naught else needs be explained anent this simple concept...save that a gladiator's rank is determined by his prestige.
13242 : Prestige is the gladiator's equivalent of the common adventurer's fame.
13243 : Defeating both monsters and monipulators increaseth thy prestige, while falling victim to their claws decreaseth it.
13244 : Each rank also hath a corresponding maximum amount of prestige, much like the infamy of monipulators.
13245 : Ascertaining thy current prestige is merely a trifle. (Access the Profile menu under Status.)
13246 : Of course, prestige is not simply a means by which to boast to thy inferiors. Thou canst cede it to me in exchange for troves of splendid rewards.
13247 : No victory doth taste as sweet as one where the stakes are high. Flaying treacherous notorious monsters and high notorious monsters occasionally earns thee spoils of war.
13248 : A little cockatrice told me that monipulators even relinquish equipment betimes, so hold not back from slicing, stabbing, and spellcasting thy savage enemies to smithereens.
13249 : Eke, the equipment thou dost obtain may be engraved with arcane glyptics.
13250 : Eke, the equipment thou dost obtain may be engraved with arcane glyptics by my consorts.
13251 : Athwart terrestrial beings such as thee, our mezzotinting process leaveth nary a scratch on extant arcane glyptics.
13252 : In sooth, it would be pure idiocy to charge nothing for our services. However, I shan't discuss figures at this juncture.
13253 : Forget not that we must have % in order to engrave arcane glyptics, lest thou wish to incur the wrath of my people.
13254 : Thy soul pineth for more than thou canst conceive. Set it free and embark upon gladiatorial exploits the likes of which Vana'diel hath never witnessed.
13255 : Aroint, thou malmsey-nosed fustilarian!
13256 : What shall you do? Receive %. Return %. Participate in PT Content. Exchange prestige. Hear an explanation. Engage in friendly banter. Nothing.
13257 : Possessing % enableth thee to enter combat with monipulators. Dost thou assent?
13258 : Give your assent? Yes. No.
13259 : Thou tardy-gaited poltroon! Dost thou soothly desire to return thy % and withdraw?
13260 : Return and withdraw? Yes. No.
13261 : Bear in mind that transferring thy soul to the frames of other creatures hath its limits. Occasionally stretch thy sinews as a gladiator to both round thy world view and reach higher heights.
13262 : What is it thou desirest?
13263 : Which reward? (Prestige: #) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) None.
13264 : Thou art willing to part with # point[/s] of prestige to obtain this %, nay?
13265 : Proceed with the exchange? (Prestige: #) Yes. No.
13266 : Quotha, the least thou canst do is provide the requisite amount of prestige... Where are thy manners?
13267 : Assuming the form of a monster for too many moons doth exert an unwanted influence upon thy anima. Take pleasure in thy time spent within multiple forms, but not so much that thou canst never return to thy original vessel.
13268 : Though monipulators and gladiators art diametrically opposed, thou mayest shift alliance betwixt both sides of the conflict as thy humors see fit. There cannot be good without evil, and the sides shall for all eternity be in stasis.
13269 : Good and evil, monipulator and adventurer...they are but two sides of the same coin.
13270 : Oh, how I yearn to assume the form of a monster in the same manner as thee. Wellaway, I must be content with mine empty husk of a vessel.
13271 : I suppose that I too a monipulator hight. Natheless, that fact doth not give thee permission to assail my frame with thy blows.
13272 : One could conceivably clepe me a monipulator as well, sith I too possess hosts.
13273 : This % hath yet to be mezzotinted.
13274 : Drastic changes are in store for this %, methinks.
13275 : This % hath reached the pinnacle of enhancement. I can do naught but stare in amazement at thy progress.
13276 : In return for # point[/s] of prestige from thee, I shall [enhance the arcane glyptics extant on/engrave arcane glyptics upon] this %.
13277 : This %'s [original/post-augmentation/post-enhancement] attributes are thus:
13278 : This % doth be in good...tails?
13279 : This % hath been enhanced with arcane glyptics already.
13280 : This % hath reached its limits and cannot be further enhanced, but may still evolve into newer forms.
13281 : This % hath reached its limits and cannot evolve further.
13282 : What do you wish to do? Evolve the item. Mezzotint. Nothing.
13283 : Which type of glyptics shall you engrave?
13284 : Which type do you want engraved? Arcane Glyptic Type A. Arcane Glyptic Type B. Arcane Glyptic Type C. None.
13285 : Do you wish to mezzotint your weapon so that it is primed to receive the aforementioned attribute enhancements?
13286 : Do you wish to mezzotint your weapon again so that it is primed to receive these attribute enhancements?
13287 : Your % has successfully undergone mezzotinting.
13288 : How do you feel about these attributes? I heartily enjoy them. I despise them and want new ones.
13289 : In return for # point[/s] of prestige from thee, I shall mezzotint this %.
13290 : Into which weapon shalt thou evolve this specimen?
13291 : Which one? None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
13292 : Shall this be the one?
13293 : How do you feel about this weapon? I thoroughly enjoy it. I loathe it and want a new one.
13294 : <Glare>... This is no place for the weak. Leave at once.
13295 : <Glare>... Strength is not everything. I find your lack of experience disturbing.
13296 : <Glare>... There is no denying your skill and experience. I deem you worthy.
13297 : The adversaries that once vexed you and your companions are now but specks of settled dust on your trail of conquest. However, I can make them worth battling once more.
13298 : <Glare>... In exchange, I require a vessel containing your memories and something you adventurers refer to as merit points.
13299 : Life is finite and fleeting. How will you spend the rest of what remains to you?
13300 : What will you do? Let time pass by idly. Exchange merit points. View accomplishments 1. View accomplishments 2.
13301 : Exchange for what? (# point[/s]) Nothing. %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) %. (#) Previous page. Next page.
13302 : Truly relinquish # merit point[/s]? Yes. No.
13303 : <Glare>... I can do nothing with that amount.
13304 : <Glare>... If all you covet is peace, then I have nothing further to discuss with you.
13305 : If that is what you want, then take it.
13306 : Make for the territory to which your phantom gem belongs.
13307 : It is there that your desires shall be fulfilled.
13308 : Be not so cavalier to think that your success is assured, however. Those with no heart show no mercy. Challenge them without just resolve, and your bout will surely end in failure.
13309 : Contained within are the annals of your encounters with the world's most vicious foes.

13330 : Wait one short second while I get your goods!
13331 : Something went wrong, kupo! Try again later.
13332 : Hey, you--able adventurer! Cast your gaze on the countenance of this misbegotten mutant.
13333 : Glance at the good-natured glimmer in his eyes!
13334 : Take in his tiny teeth scintillating in the sunlight, kupo!
13335 : You mean...you're familiar with its furry form?
13336 : Oh hush, hustler. Listen to the lowdown before you loosen your lips.
13337 : Remember the gristly green gobs who came before? Now its mauve and maroon mates have come to wreak wrongdoings upon our realm!
13338 : At least, I suppose so. They haven't lifted a limb of late, so maybe there should be nothing nagging at my noggin after all...
13339 : Let me tell you a troubled tale. Not long ago, some grisly green gobs came to Vana'diel, and we amassed a fabulous fortune crafting countless curios in their likeness.
13340 : But there was an--inconsequential?--issue with them consuming crystals like crunchy candies.
13341 : Thanks to hardy heroes and moogle magic, we turned them into cerulean stone shards and sent them scurrying home, kupo.
13342 : But we gave the victors great gifts resembling those rowdy ruffians, so our profits plummeted and we had to cancel our tropical travel plans...
13343 : But the past is in the past. We must make the most of the moment!
13344 : And so! With the multicolored monsters now manifesting themselves, we found our next best chance!
13345 : They haven't lifted a limb of late, so maybe there's nothing to knock my noggin over...
13346 : Thus, we have an ostensibly outstanding opportunity to manufacture new knickknacks, kupo!
13347 : Part of the proceeds will be diverted to do up dilapidated Mog Houses, with the rest funding our jovial jaunts!
13348 : Kupopopo! How magnificently marvelous!
13349 : You can't discern the difference between the dimensional delegates?
13350 : Give them a good glance!
13351 : I guess their terrible teeth and enchanting eyes do look alike...
13352 : But the metal in their mitts and trinkets on their waists! Those are different, kupo!
13353 : Wonderful! We can cut down on costs and rake in the revenue! Vivacious vacations for all!
13354 : A-ah! Forget my frivolous fettering.
13355 : But if we captured the cerulean creatures before, then how did they surreptitiously scuttle back?
13356 : Undeniably unimportant. What matters most is the moment!
13357 : Oh ho? A covert communique from my cohort in charge of the stone shard storage.
13358 : Yes? Mm hmm... Mm hmm...
13359 : Altana kupo it all!
13360 : The ones we previously petrified have escaped, and they're traipsing outside town!
13361 : Then again, the clock was ticking on the enchantment expiring.
13362 : ...And now a nuanced notification from outside town? Oh, dear.
13363 : Th-then it's true, kupo!
13364 : Great gasping Goblins! Those furry freaks are capturing crystals again!
13365 : And their bespeckled brethren are helping, kupo!
13366 : If they succeed in pilfering our precious prizes, Vana'diel will descend into a desolate decay!
13367 : And worse, snafu will surely stain the M.H.M.U.'s resplendent reputation!
13368 : Most excellent explorer, please travel outside town and round up these recidivist reprobates!
13369 : A mixture of moogle magic will enable you to ensconce the evildoers by subjugating them into stone shards.
13370 : Of course, I'll reward your righteousness with the requisite remuneration, kupo.
13371 : But since we have such a short supply of stuff, I have to let Lady Luck look upon you with...a lottery!
13372 : The most prestigious prizes are awarded in the order of mauve, vermilion, and chartruese stone shards.
13373 : The goods we've gathered can be chosen from a long list that lengthens depending on your success.
13374 : Simply stated, if you procure first prize, you can select spoils from lower levels should you deign to do so. And so on.
13375 : This is a dire dilemma, so I shall send you off to the outskirts immediately. Are you ready, kupo?
13376 : Be teleported outside of town? You bet! I don't think so.
13377 : Ready and raring to go! The M.H.M.U.--and all Vana'diel--appreciates your assistance!
13378 : O-oh dear, kupo... But we really require reinforcements! Please reconsider, kupo!
13379 : You have phenomenally procured a prodigious amount of # chartruese stone shard[/s], # vermilion stone shard[/s], and # mauve stone shard[/s]. What would you like, kupo?
13380 : What will you do? Spin the wheel! (# chartruese shard[/s]) Spin the wheel! (# vermilion shard[/s]) Spin the wheel! (# mauve shard[/s]) Check the item list. Warp outside town. Nothing.
13381 : You have not harvested a sufficient supply of [mauve stone shards/vermilion stone shards/chartruese stone shards], kupo! Clobber more critters and come back later!
13382 : Altana above, kupo!
13383 : Congratulations!
13384 : You're more likely to get on a hot streak thanks to the intricacies of that item!
13385 : You are on a hot streak!
13386 : Your hot streak has burned out.
13387 : Roll them bones, kupo!
13388 : And the outstanding outcome is...
13389 : [.../First prize! Absolutely amazing!/Second prize! Emphatically excellent!/Third prize! Positively peachy!]
13390 : ...the booby prize, kupo...
13391 : Select your prize from the long list I'm about to lay upon you, kupo!
13392 : [What would you like/View which item]? %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. [I'll decide later/I'm done].
13393 : Would you like this item, kupo?
13394 : Really select that item? Undoubtedly. Let me think on it.
13395 : Come back and call upon me when you determine which doodad you desire!
13396 : View which category? First prize. Second prize. Third prize. Booby prize. None for now.
13397 : It goes something like this, kupo.
13398 : That little black bugger has been staring into your soul for some time now, kupo.
13399 : Don't be charmed by its conniving countenance! It'll con a crystal from you!
13400 : Here where?
13401 : Give shiny rock! Shiiiny. Shiiiiiiny!
13402 : You give [hot/dirty/wet/sparkly/cold/windy/bright/dark/many/big] stone! Love you! Looove! Loooooove!
13403 : Happy! Much happy! For you! Yooou!
13404 : I have! Still have! No need more!
13405 : Hey! You there! I've got a proposition of sorts for [a fresh-faced/an able-bodied/a world-class] adventurer such as yourself!
13406 : You can call me Clarion Star. I've come from Jeuno, the lovely city in the northeast that connects the Quon and Mindartia continents.
13407 : Specifically, I'm a representative of sorts from the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies. You could call me a headhunter!
13408 : Bwahaha! And the heads I am hunting today are those of bright-eyed explorers like yourself!
13409 : So here's the deal. Not too long ago, the institute held an international symposium of sorts, at which we announced the development of a fascinatingly useful new type of magic.
13410 : We made it available for everyone to utilize, and so we are trying it out here in Bastok and other places throughout Vana'diel.
13411 : We've chosen to call the new magic Trust, and as an official delegate of the institute, I want adventurers of your caliber to be the lucky first participants.
13412 : So? What about it? Want to try it out?
13413 : Try out the new magic? What have I got to lose? Magic scares me.
13414 : An adventurer of sorts scared of magic? Pffft. Your loss, bud.
13415 : That's the kind of spunk I like!
13416 : You're surely aware that Bastok is no stranger to developing new technologies, and as such Cid and the Mythril Musketeers are conducting research of sorts into the application of this new magic.
13417 : You know how they are--always at odds with the Beastman Confederate. They think that Trust might be able to help bolster their forces, they say.
13418 : However! Not just anyone can use Trust.
13419 : As you can imagine, the institute is thus collecting data of sorts in San d'Oria and Windurst, too, trying to get as many people as possible to participate.
13420 : It should come as no surprise, then, that we have other representatives in those two nations. If you'd rather head over there, then we've got nothing more to discuss...
13421 : But I'm sure the Mythril Musketeers here would appreciate any help you could give 'em.
13422 : Let's cut to the quick. Helping them earns you the aid of a powerful warrior of sorts, which can only help you in your travels.
13423 : Assist in Trust endeavors in Bastok? Of course. No, thank you.
13424 : If you're dead set on going elsewhere, I can't stop you...but I'm right here, and surely you'd rather not take a long journey.
13425 : Bwahaha! Perfect response!
13426 : [If that's the case,/Okay! So] let's get right to it. Before we go any further, let me give you this.
13427 : Your first task of sorts is to speak with Naji of the Mythril Musketeers, in the Metalworks. He can guide you further.
13428 : Do you know where it is? Just head up the staircase behind me and cross the bridge to the west. Someone in the markets just past there can guide you further.
13429 : Take the lift up to the second floor, where you'll find him waiting by the staircase that leads to the president's office. No one across the land is as faithful or skilled a guard as he.
13430 : How are you finding those alter egos? Need an explanation of sorts as to how they work?
13431 : Inquire about what? What Trust is. What happens when one uses Trust. How to learn new Trust spells. Whereabouts of Trust participants. Nothing at the moment.
13432 : Trust is a new category of magic developed and announced by the Jeuno Institute for Magical Studies.
13433 : Though it is a magic of sorts, unlike ordinary spells it does not require mana. Instead, it draws on the power of trust, friendship, and [brotherly/sisterly] love.
13434 : Friendship, of course, crosses all boundaries, so Trust magic can be used regardless of your job.
13435 : But for the love of all that is holy, don't go around bonding with alter egos in cities. It'll confuse everyone.
13436 : Using Trust magic calls forth an alter ego of someone you have formed a strong personal bond with.
13437 : They say friendships work best as a relationship between equals. Thus, the alter ego is only as strong as the person who willed it into existence.
13438 : The alter ego will gladly fight by your side, but you will be unable to issue it direct orders.
13439 : Research of sorts is ongoing, but it might take a while for any concrete progress to be made.
13440 : When you wish to release an alter ego from service, you only need speak to it.
13441 : It goes without saying that if an alter ego falls in battle, it will vanish into thin air. But don't fret--you can summon it again once a certain period of time has passed.
13442 : Trust magic is quite aptly named. It calls forth an alter ego of sorts using the power of trust, friendship, and [brotherly/sisterly] love.
13443 : To employ its powers, you must first find and befriend one who is allowed to harness them.
13444 : If they do not listen to your request, then perhaps they don't think highly enough of you. Get the town talking about your deeds and I'm sure they'll give you another chance. If they still won't listen--well, you just come back to me.
13445 : Of course, they still might not want to be friends. Maybe you're like me and doomed to be forever alone! Bwahaha! <Sob>
13446 : Oh ho[/, I almost forgot]! There is another way to utilize this magic. There are ongoing investigations of sorts into how to call forth an alter ego without directly meeting the person.
13447 : It takes a little something special, but if you find a scroll with this exceptional ability, all you need do is give it to me.
13448 : Hang on just a tick. Let's take a look...
13449 : [Excenmille/Naji/Kupipi/Curilla/Ayame/Nanaa Mihgo/Trion/Volker/Ajido-Marujido/Iron Eater/Prishe/Ulmia/Shikaree Z/Cherukiki/Gadalar/Zazarg/Nashmeira/Gessho/Ingrid/Maat/Arciela/Chacharoon] can be found in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Tavnazia/Aht Urhgan/Adoulin/the Mog Gardens].
13450 : Wish I had new information of sorts to share with you, but I don't!
13451 : I can't believe that you got your hands on %! Amazing!
13452 : I can't believe such a celebrity would want to participate!
13453 : This is all thanks to people like you who have succeeded in calling forth alter egos.
13454 : Just let me analyze this data for a...what do you mean, hurry up?
13455 : The Trust initiative has seen some outstanding breakthroughs in recent days thanks to the tireless dedication of those like yourself.
13456 : Your bonds with that person far exceed anything we have ever seen!
13457 : I could espouse for hours about how lucky...what do you mean, hurry up?
13458 : Who on Vana'diel is this person? I've never heard of... Ugh. And to think I call myself a fine representative of the institute.
13459 : Hmmmmmm? Okay, okay, I'll make it snappy!
13460 : A curious case, this one...
13461 : Some ethereal force is preventing the cipher from displaying its true potential.
13462 : ou cannot read this cipher due to an event occurring in Rhapsodies of Vana'diel.
13463 : This cipher appears to be the real deal, but damned if I know who it'll actually call forth. Let's give it a try!
13464 : ...An apparition, you say?
13465 : Ah, the fresh face of youth as they acquire a new alter ego. Never shall I tire of it.
13466 : I'll let you in on something--the Trust initiative is being spread beyond the five races...with some very interesting results.
13467 : Close your eyes and go to your happy place, where trust and friendship and [brotherly/sisterly] love blossom like flax flowers in a meadow.
13468 : What an amazing success of sorts!
13469 : So many of our trials ended in failure. I kept hoping it might work...but this--this is beyond my wildest dreams!
13470 : H-how did you know that it's called Trust!? Were you at the symposium?
13471 : Ohhh, I see. You got a lesson of sorts in one of the other nations. This makes it simple. How's about undertaking Trust experiments here in Bastok?
13472 : Impressive! It's no small feat to acquire %!
13473 : Doctor Monberaux is a powerful person of sorts in Jeuno. Having an alter ego of him will make your journey that much easier.
13474 : The good doctor was a bit surprised to be paid a visit by the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies. I think he expected a high-ranking friend of his to be chosen first.
13475 : You see, his friend Wolf... No, I don't suppose it's our place to talk about that.
13476 : Close your eyes while picturing Doctor Monberaux and go to your happy place, where trust and friendship and [brotherly/sisterly] love blossom like flax flowers in a meadow.
13477 : It's a smashing success!
13478 : Just as the Institute of Magical Studies suspected, Doctor Monberaux is an excellent candidate of sorts for using Trust magic. This is excellent news!
13479 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
13480 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
13481 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
13482 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
13483 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).
13484 : Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.
13485 : The % nods in agreement.
13486 : new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
13487 : new Records of Eminence objective, %, is now available!
13488 : You wish to exchange your sparks?
13489 : Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
13490 : Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
13491 : Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
13492 : Thanks to your donation, I now have # % in safekeeping.
13493 : Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
13494 : Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
13495 : Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
13496 : Why? What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
13497 : Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of # % from you.
13498 : You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
13499 : Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
13500 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
13501 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
13502 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
13503 : Grrreat! Now I have # % from you. Thanks!
13504 : Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
13505 : I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
13506 : Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
13507 : I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
13508 : Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of # % for you.
13509 : Records of Eminence is a system brought to you by the caring folks at the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Set your own objectives whenever you desire, and fulfill them to receive compensation.
13510 : To set these tasks, select 'Objective List' from the Quests menu, then choose ones that suit your fancy.
13511 : You will be rewarded with gil and sparks of eminence, which serve the same function as points, notes, credits, and other such methods of quantifying one's greatness. As an extra incentive, adventurers will earn three times the amount of sparks for completing an objective the first time.
13512 : Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
13513 : As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
13514 : Lastly, any and all acts of vandalism directed against your % are strictly prohibited.
13515 : Should you be found in violation of this dictum, the heavens will part and wrath incarnate will descend to mete out justice upon you.
13516 : The maximum number of % that may be stored is #.

13589 : Heigh-ho, kupo! I'm the boatswain for this darned-good dinghy, and it's my duty to divulge all the discursive details about Mog Gardens. So, what kind of cognition are you craving?
13590 : What do you want to know? Nothing. What Mog Gardens are. How to get to one. What Mog Garden books are available.
13591 : We've got staggering stores of the following scholarly scripts and tantalizing tomes, kupo!

13594 : Buy the book? Yes. No.
13595 : Trading tender for treasures...isn't shopping sublime, kupo?
13596 : Disappointingly, I doubt you've the discernment to descry the details of these documents. Exit then, and expand the extent of your experience.
13597 : Sorry, but our stocks of such sundries are so scarce we can't sell them.
13598 : Mog Gardens are lovely locales that lie latent in the west, on the Adoulin Islands. They're true treasure troves of taintless resources, frothing with fish, bursting with birds, and filled with forests, kupo!
13599 : Think of it as your Mog House away from home! Just like that fantastic facility, there's a wealth of wonders just waiting to well up for your disposal.
13600 : Spread your wings as wide as you wish without worrying about the consequences, kupo. The Green Thumb Moogle will handle the husbandry of this homestead while you're out hacking at hordes of hellions and cavorting across continents.
13601 : If you're shivering to shove off, then shuffle aboard the Mog Dinghy over there! It may seem small and slightly slipshod, but the mysterious moogle magic we manifest upon it is magnificent enough to move you malms and malms in mere minutes.
13602 : Once you adjust to your Adoulinian asylum, I'll even proffer printed publications that will make your Mog Garden more majestic. Grab your gil and get ready, kupo!
13603 : While it'd be wickedly wonderful to whisk away everyone to Mog Gardens, only Certified Adventurers and pioneers are allowed entry to these excellent expanses of escape, kupo.
13604 : Certified Adventurers are those who have applied themselves assiduously, attaining the third mission rank in any nation.
13605 : It doesn't have to be here as long as you were once appropriately accredited in times antecedent.
13606 : If Adoulin's body politic has properly permitted you to perform pioneering duties, however, your so-called rank can be lower than a leech's legs and you'll still be let in, kupo.

13630 : Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
13631 : Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.
13632 : Unity is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.
13633 : Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.
13634 : Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as %.
13635 : Chat settings may be changed by selecting Status from the main menu, and choosing Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
13636 : You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.
13637 : Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.
13638 : The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.
13639 : Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).
13640 : Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.
13641 : Wanted objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.
13642 : These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as Unity accolades to undertake.
13643 : Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.
13644 : Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.
13645 : The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.
13646 : A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.
13647 : Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.
13648 : Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.
13649 : When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.
13650 : Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.
13651 : No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.
13652 : You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.
13653 : An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.
13654 : One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.
13655 : A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.
13656 : You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.
13657 : Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.
13658 : Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.
13659 : Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.
13660 : The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.
13661 : It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.
13662 : The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.
13663 : Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.
13664 : These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.
13665 : Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.
13666 : Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of # accolades per week (Earth time).
13667 : You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.
13668 : This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.
13669 : This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.
13670 : However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.
13671 : Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.
13672 : The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.
13673 : Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.
13674 : Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.
13675 : On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.
13676 : Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by #. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.
13677 : The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.
13678 : Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.
13679 : Those with evaluations of # or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.
13680 : Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.
13681 : A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.
13682 : Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.
13683 : A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.
13684 : It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.
13685 : Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.
13686 : ou are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.
13687 : he A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.
13688 : ou call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.
13689 : ou have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.
13690 : hould you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?
13691 : Teleport anyway? Yes, please. No, thank you.
13692 : The mandragora surreptitiously hands you something.
13693 : The crystal resonates deep within your soul!
13694 : Vana'diel...in the year 898?
13695 : I must make haste for Reisenjima and find the master before...
13696 : Master, look at the orb.
13697 : You have set us on the proper course and passed through the first of many gates to come.
13698 : This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.
13699 : Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.
13700 : Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.
13701 : In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.
13702 : Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.
13703 : Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.
13704 : I've set up shop at this site in search of souls to sell sundries to, kupo! Come back later for some glorious goodies!
13705 : Come hither, able adventurer! From precipitously perilous peaks to completely creepy caves, I've gathered glorious goodies to sell to one such as yourself!
13706 : Y-you don't seriously suspect I stole this sumptuous stash through some surreptitious scheme!? I assure you I acquired them on the up-and-up!
13707 : You won't find frivolous frauds here, only absolutely authentic articles, kupo!
13708 : Back to buy, kupo?
13709 : Tremendous timing! I've imported an incredible inventory of immaculate items!
13710 : What would you like? Nothing for now. Medicine. Ammunition. Ninjutsu tools. Foodstuffs. Scrolls. Keys. Ciphers. Various key items.
13711 : Get your hands on what? None of these. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. %: # gil. Previous page. Next page.

13713 : Purchase that item? (# gil) Yes, please. No, thank you.
13714 : Always a pleasure!
13715 : Master, behold your orb.
13716 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.
13717 : But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...
13718 : And I am unable to remain here in 884.
13719 : My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.
13720 : Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...
13721 : But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.
13722 : May your steps remain swift and true.
13723 : Head for...the palace...
13724 : Master, behold your orb.
13725 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.
13726 : But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.
13727 : I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.
13728 : If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!
13729 : Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!
13730 : Master...forgive me.
13731 : Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.
13732 : I'm so hungry...
13733 : Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?
13734 : I'm here...[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...
13735 : Luzaf...I wish you were here...
13736 : Please...help me...
13737 : Razfahd must be stopped...
13738 : Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...
13739 : I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.
13740 : I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.
13741 : Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.
13742 : The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.
13743 : Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?
13744 : Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?
13745 : Old gods? New?
13746 : No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.
13747 : We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.
13748 : And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.
13749 : There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.
13750 : Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.
13751 : And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.
13752 : Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.
13753 : But I am not a human such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.
13754 : For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.
13755 : Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.
13756 : Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.
13757 : It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.
13758 : I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.
13759 : All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...
13760 : An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.
13761 : I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.
13762 : Can you truly say that you [did/would have done] any different?
13763 : I channeled my love for my homeland into power.
13764 : When I fell before you...
13765 : ...did it mean everything was for naught?
13766 : I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.
13767 : And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.
13768 : This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.
13769 : Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.
13770 : Open your eyes and witness the truth!
13771 : Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!
13772 : %...
13773 : What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?
13774 : Is this a dream? What else could it be? No. It's something more...
13775 : Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.
13776 : A keen eye, as always.
13777 : The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.
13778 : As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.
13779 : I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.
13780 : And those...
13781 : ...Who you are destined to stop.
13782 : I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.
13783 : Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.
13784 : And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.
13785 : You don't really expect to save the world, do you?
13786 : At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.
13787 : Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.
13788 : So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.
13789 : One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.
13790 : Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.
13791 : False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers... The truth is the pain I feel inside.
13792 : Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.
13793 : Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.
13794 : Perhaps not even your precious-wecious hope.
13795 : Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.
13796 : No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...
13797 : ...no matter how much you want to give up...
13798 : You must not. You cannot.
13799 : Hope is something seized, not given.
13800 : Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...
13801 : There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.
13802 : You are the culmination of all your experiences.
13803 : Even those who are gone still depend on you.
13804 : %, this rhapsody is yours to sing.
13808 : Master--the orb.
13809 : You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.
13810 : Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.
13811 : He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.
13812 : I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?
13813 : What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.
13814 : We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.
13815 : Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.
13816 : And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...
13817 : The future should have changed...
13818 : ...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.
13819 : Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.
13820 : And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.
13821 : You have entered the crafting target area.
13822 : Crafting the requested items in the current target area will count towards the number of items you are required to deliver them.
13823 : You have left the crafting target area.
13824 : # % remaining.
13825 : I am in need of some %. Can you get # more for me?
13826 : Yes, this is the % I am looking for. Please bring me # more.
13827 : Yes, these are the % I am looking for. Please bring me # more.
13828 : This is the last of them. They look so delicious, I think I might want to order some for myself!
13829 : I'm looking for % and require # more.
13830 : With this delivery of %, I need # more to fulfill the order.
13831 : With this delivery of %, I need # more to fulfill the order.
13832 : That should do it! I have all the % I require. You can consider the order fulfilled.
13833 : Welcome to the Steaming Sheep, home of the finest cuisine Bastok has to offer.
13834 : Today we're pleased to be hosting the 1st Annual Brygid Cosplay Fiesta!
13835 : Enter the Steaming Sheep? Ready to go! I need more time.
13836 : Wow! What a performance!
13837 : Yes, words absolutely fail me at how your outfit accentuates your, um...curves? Well, a job well done, even though I would normally hope for something a little more family friendly.
13838 : Ladies and gentlemen, things are really starting to heat up in today's event, with people coming from far and wide to show all Bastok that they've got what it takes to become our champion.
13839 : Who'll be next to take the stage and wow us with their devastatingly accurate and altogether embarrassing representation of famous Bastokers?
13840 : Hey, I don't think embarrassing is the best word to use here...
13841 : Our next three contestants are ready to take the stage! Here they come, so give them a big round of applause!
13842 : Yes, feast your eyes on these wonderful reimaginings of real-life stars! Ogle them from head to toe and take in every last nook and cranny of their delectable forms!
13843 : O-ogle? Delectable!?
13844 : You all did such fantastic jobs! I would have mistaken you for the real thing!
13845 : Let's cut now to the judges and see what their frank assessments are. Judges, take it away!
13846 : I gotta say, it took a lot of guts for you to choose Ayame, but that's one heck of a show you've put on!
13847 : Ayame, fourth member of the Mythril Musketeers, is known for her grace in attitude and attire, as well as her skill on the field of battle.
13848 : I would have expected many more people to choose to dress up as her, but it looks like you blew the competition away before they could even come out!
13849 : No one wanted to choose me...
13850 : Huh!?
13851 : And if it isn't the woman, the myth, the legend herself! Ayame, would you give us your impression of the contestant's best attempt at reproducing your loveliness?
13852 : Uh... Well, yes, it certainly is quite the sight.
13853 : I might not be the, uh, most popular choice, but I'm touched that someone chose me as their inspiration.
13854 : Oh, no, Ayame, it has nothing to do with popularity! People are just so blinded by your brilliance that no one felt they could even hold a candle to you. Isn't that right?
13855 : Oh, yes! Of course! I'm, um, sorry that I couldn't hold a candle...
13856 : And that's a big fat no from me! It seems our participant finally realized that they can't cut the mustard!
13857 : Thanks...I guess?
13858 : That's right, Ayame is just completely untouchable!
13859 : Let's move on to our next contestant, shall we?
13860 : Wow, I can't believe that someone would actually choose Azima, perhaps the stuffiest woman in all of Bastok!
13861 : When I see your stunning profile, as wrinkled and gnarled as the old oak tree mere moments before it is felled by the lumberjack...
13862 : I think back on my own mother, may she rest in peace...
13863 : What ya blabbering on about, talking about me like I'm some old hag!?
13864 : Urk--!
13865 : Why, if it isn't the esteemed Azima herself, here to give us her frank assessment of our challenger!
13866 : Oh no, you don't escape that easily, young lady. I heard every word you said!
13867 : N-n-no! Don't hurt me! I was just providing some color commentary!
13868 : Hmmm. I suppose I could give ya an honest opinion.
13869 : Try learning some respect for your elders!
13870 : Look at the fire in her eyes--obviously a reflection of the pile of hot garbage she sees before her!
13871 : H-hey! I did my best...
13872 : And yet another catastrophic failure abandons the stage! Azima's biting tongue remains too much to bear!
13873 : I can't believe youngsters these days...
13874 : Don't let this put a damper on your spirits, folks, for the show must go on!
13875 : Would you take a look at this--a recreation of the magnificent Iron Eater, whose steely gaze can silence even the loudest of crying babies!
13876 : True to his name, he can devour even the toughest of metals!
13877 : I really don't think that he--
13878 : For this contestant, let's hear from one of our female judges!
13879 : I-Iron Eater?
13880 : Amazing! Even Hilda is fooled by the costume's incredibly high degree of accuracy!
13881 : Hey, Ken, you're finally starting to sound like a real emcee!
13882 : Well, given how much you've talked over me across the years--
13883 : But no, our contestant is not, in fact, the real thing!
13884 : Wh-what the--!?
13885 : So, Hilda, what do you say!?
13886 : Our challenger looks like Iron Eater, but the mannerisms are missing a little...je ne sais quoi.
13887 : Je-ne-sais-what now?
13888 : Ahhh, I think I get it. No matter how accurate you can recreate the outfit, it is all for naught unless you can properly mimic the original's quirks! Yes, another person for our ever-growing trash heap!
13889 : Marin...I think you're being a bit too harsh on everyone.
13890 : So crawl back under the rock you call home and show not your face again!
13891 : Feast your eyes on our next model--a true sight to behold!
13892 : Why, look at the aura of loserness emanating from him! Absolutely true to the original!
13893 : Can't you be a little more positive!?
13894 : Let's hear from one of our female judges. Hilda?
13895 : I-is that Naji!?
13896 : Wow! If she really thinks that's Naji, the costume must be perfect!
13897 : Hey, Ken, you're finally starting to sound like a real emcee!
13898 : Well, given how much you've talked over me across the years--
13899 : I've, uh, got some unfortunate news. Naji was scheduled to give a few words, but I'm afraid he can't be here today.
13900 : Oh no! What a terrible turn of events!
13901 : But, uh, our audience remains unfazed by this unexpected twist!
13902 : Yet someone just like him is right up there on the stage.
13903 : Ah, and you mean to say that our contestant is close enough to the real Naji.
13904 : Or, to put it another way, everything would have turned out the same with or without Naji here!
13905 : I don't think you should be putting words in her mouth...
13906 : Anyway, thank you, Naji! I'm sure your efforts will be reflected in your final score!
13907 : And next, we've got-- Ack!
13908 : Zeid...
13909 : Ha ha ha!
13910 : Amazing costume! This is clearly the pinnacle of mankind's achievement!
13911 : You don't know how difficult it was to get ahold of all this rare equipment!
13912 : All that mythril set me back an arm and a leg.
13913 : Mythril...?
13914 : You do cut an impressive pose, to be sure, but there's something about you that isn't quite Zeid-like...
13915 : Ah, yes! Now that's more like the Zeid I know.
13916 : This costume is absolutely perfect! You should follow this young man's lead and make your Zeid outfit more like his!
13917 : You there! I'm enlisting you into our little show. Come up onto the stage!
13918 : Yes, you! Come on, being asked to participate in such a wonderful show is quite the honor! Get your rear in gear!
13919 : I, uh, just came here to talk to Oggbi...
13920 : Of course, of course! What Oggbi thinks of your outfit is quite important indeed! So take the stage and hear just what he thinks of your getup!
13921 : Oggbi, I'd really prefer to talk someplace quieter...
13922 : So, judges, what do you have to say about this magnificent Zeid costume?
13923 : I don't think I've ever seen a more impressive Zeid! Everything is just as it should be--the way you walk, the way you talk...it's uncannily close to the real thing!
13924 : Wherever did you get such wonderful equipment? It's absolutely marvelous!
13925 : I don't think the real Zeid is supposed to be in Bastok right now...
13926 : Why, even Oggbi is fooled by the realism that our newest contestant exudes! Spectacular!
13927 : Why, Zeid-alike, I think our judges are beyond impressed by the extent of your efforts!
13928 : What the heck is going on?
13929 : It's like you're actually him...!
13930 : <Sigh>...
13931 : While I'd love to be able to chitchat with you more, Zeid-alike, we've got some more contestants to get through!
13932 : And without further ado, here's our next challenger...
13933 : [Azima/Naji/Black Mud/Michea/Nbu Latteh]!
13934 : Why, this is the costume to end all costumes! Look at how [he/she] positively gleams with radiance!
13935 : I bet our maven of fashion, Brygid, is brimming with pride at how you've really helped bring the show together!
13936 : I'm impressed by the accuracy of your attempt. But my opinions don't matter as much as the judges'!
13937 : Surely the audience also appreciates all the effort you put into your appearance!
13938 : Well, you certainly do have an...interesting take, to be sure! Words fail me.
13939 : So, uh, Ken! Take it away!
13940 : I...well...yes, words fail me, too.
13941 : ...
13942 : Yes, yes, this is exceptional. The time and effort you must have put into this is astounding.
13943 : I absolutely love it. I'd love to have you wait on me hand and foot...or is that asking a bit too much?
13944 : Something is a little off...but then again, Naji himself is usually a little off, too.
13945 : You're right, Cid. Naji always did have a couple screws loose.
13946 : Hahaha!
13947 : You put nearly no thought and effort into this, did you? Yet that in and of itself is rather Naji-esque.
13948 : Speaking of Naji, it's about time for him to pay his tab...
13949 : We were scheduled to hear a few words from Naji himself, but unfortunately he can't be with us today.
13950 : So instead, Ken will give us the final word!
13951 : M-me!? Well...thanks for coming!
13952 : And there we have it, folks! A big round of applause for our Naji lookalike!
13953 : Hang on...[he/she] looks nothing like Azima.
13954 : O-oh no. I can feel all the war memories come flooding back...
13955 : I may have only caught a glimpse of her once, but that matronly figure cannot be denied.
13956 : Perfect. Absolutely perfect. I remember once having thought that she was the wickedest of witches.
13957 : War memories? What the--
13958 : My goodness, you certainly have Azima down to a T. I can feel her gaze of self-superiority bearing down on me even now.
13959 : Yes, you certainly do have the same air of competence about you.
13960 : Azima and I have a long history. Why, it was she who introduced me to my now-husband.
13961 : Really? She did that!?
13962 : Wait, this is supposed to be an Azima outfit? Hmm...
13963 : Haha! For a moment, I thought I misheard, too!
13964 : And now we'll hear from Azima herself!
13965 : The Hermitess of the Highlands...
13966 : The what!?
13967 : Yes, that is what they used to call me! And you, young one, can certainly make something from nothing.
13968 : I have no idea what you're on about, Azima, but thanks for your insight! A big round of applause!
13969 : Outstanding work, adventurer! You took someone who doesn't really stand out from the crowd and brought them to life!
13970 : Workers of all stripes really deserve more recognition for their efforts. Why, even my apron was made by a skilled laborer such as him.
13971 : And let's all be thankful that no one but you wears something like that.
13972 : Black Mud and I share a long history of camaraderie. I was prepared to give you zero points if you didn't do him justice...but you have.
13973 : I just wish he was a little better at reading maps.
13974 : Cid, can you help jog my memory? I can't properly recall how Black Mud dresses.
13975 : Hahaha, me neither! In fact, who is Black Mud, anyway?
13976 : And now for a few words from Black Mud himself!
13977 : If you're ever on the lookout for rare materials from Tavnazia, Adoulin, and places beyond, be sure to visit me, and I'll place them on order for you. Black Mud, here for all your everyday needs!
13978 : Um, you're not here for the free advertising. We're all waiting for your comments on [his/her] outfit.
13979 : I don't know what this is all about, but if you're using my likeness, you need to pay the proper compensation--
13980 : Yes, yes, thank you, Black Mud! Now go back to where you came from, to the rousing applause of our audience!
13981 : Why, I didn't think it was possible for someone to recreate Michea so faithfully!
13982 : Her wares have always impressed me with an inner warmth that can only come from someone who truly loves their craft, and you have brought that same warmth to your costume.
13983 : As warm as your wonderful meals, Hilda.
13984 : Oh, Oggbi, you're making me blush! Maybe I'll have to make you a little extra next time you stop by.
13985 : I think you did a good job of emulating Michea. What do you think, Cid?
13986 : Hmmm... A goldsmith, huh? I think maybe I should order my special someone a new ring...
13987 : Dalzakk, if only you were here to see this... But I guess [he/she]'s just a contestant, not the real thing.
13988 : Michea currently works as a goldsmith here in Bastok, but she originally hails from San d'Oria.
13989 : Oh, maybe that's why I can't quite place the outfit.
13990 : No, I think it's because the entire getup is all wrong.
13991 : And finally, a few words from Michea herself!
13992 : Of all the people you could have chosen, I'm humbled and honored that you chose me.
13993 : This entire event has been such a joy, and it helped me to reaffirm that fashion is an important part of everyone's lives.
13994 : But there is one thing that I don't understand.
13995 : Why aren't you giving out points for accessories!? I'm a goldsmith, and I can say with confidence that accessories are the glue that holds an outfit together!
13996 : The next time you hold this event, be sure to give them their proper due! I'll be happy to lend my expertise to the panel.
13997 : Thank you, Michea, for that absolutely riveting--if rather out of place--tirade! We would expect nothing less from a Bastokan merchant!
13998 : A big round of applause for Michea and our competitor!
13999 : I'm quite impressed at how you've made Nbu Latteh really come to life!
14000 : Yes, it's astounding. Perhaps it's because you share a bond as adventurers?
14001 : Nbu Latteh is an adventurer? Really?
14002 : In the flesh. She's as fast as a famished chocobo and never lets prey elude her.
14003 : That's odd. I heard stories from the guards that...you know what? Forget I said anything.
14004 : Hmmm. I certainly have seen worse...but I've also seen better.
14005 : Yes, although we do appreciate the efforts you've put into replicating her one-of-a-kind charms.
14006 : I'm not sure charms are what's lacking here...
14007 : I'll tell you what's lacking--ale! I need more ale!
14008 : Nbu Latteh is an adventurer who is often spotted in Bastok Mines. Ah, yes, doesn't she have a lovely daughter...?
14009 : Not that we see her too much these days. I wonder what she's up to.
14010 : Well, she is an adventurer. But I don't recall ever seeing her dressed in...that.
14011 : Thank you for your assessment, judges. Normally we'd ask Nbu Latteh to come say a few words herself, but she's a bit tied up at the moment.
14012 : So instead, we've got her fan club here to comment on her behalf!
14013 : Ah, hello! I'm Roh Latteh, here on behalf of my mother.
14014 : Oh, aren't you just the cutest thing! I could gobble you right up! Maybe I should trade my brother for you.
14015 : ...That wouldn't be so bad.
14016 : If I do a really good job, she said she'll give me some candy, so...I'll try my hardest!
14017 : Oh, how precious and well-behaved you are! We might just have some cookies for you too!
14018 : Baked fresh by Hilda herself! Why, I would even give my brother for one of those chewy delights!
14019 : ...Again, that doesn't sound half bad.
14020 : [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer...
14021 : Thanks for doing so well!
14022 : That's all!
14023 : That's right, everyone, looks like our cute little friend is done for now! A big round of applause!
14024 : I was watching the whole time, %!
14025 : It must have been tough coming up with your outfit, but I think you did a great job.
14026 : Brygid was pleased, too, so she's sure to help us get a really great disguise for Raebrimm.
14027 : Thanks for participating today!
14028 : We're still tallying up the judges' score, so hang on just a little while longer.
14029 : Even those who didn't place highly will receive a token reward from Brygid herself, so be sure to connect with her soon.
14030 : Take care!
14031 : I've got to head out myself. See you shortly!

14083 : I'm finally able to settle down with a nice drink, but it just doesn't taste as good as it usually does...
14084 : Of course, I know it's because I'm worried about so many different things right now. <Sigh> I wonder what's going to happen...
14085 : Oh! How have you been!?
14086 : Have you seen Gumbah and Raebrimm yet?
14087 : Have you seen them? Yes, I have. No, not yet.
14088 : In that case, you may have heard that Raebrimm hasn't been feeling well lately.
14089 : In that case, you might not have heard this yet, but Raebrimm hasn't been feeling well lately.
14090 : According to him, he says that the spirits are summoning him...
14091 : Does that sound familiar to you? It's what that demon said when it appeared at the gates of the underworld.
