6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

6946 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6947 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.

11492 : does not seem to be responding to your orders...
11493 : Welcome to the Pit Stop! If you're thinking of doing anything other than just watching, you'll need jettons...and lots of them!
11494 : What can I do you for? I'd like to browse your wares. I need jettons...and lots of them! What in Altana's name is a jetton? Absolutely nothing.
11495 : Jetton is just some fancy Elvaan word for token, which is just some fancy Tarutaru word for money that can't be used anywhere but here in the Pit. And I don't care how big your wallet is, Pankration participants are only allowed to carry up to #. Period.
11496 : Anyway, with jettons you can forge %, buy items like %, and probably do lots of other keen things such as...ah, but I've said too much already.
11497 : But how do I get my hands on this magic cash, [he/she] asks. Well, that's an easy question--you purchase it from me, but I only take Imperial currency.
11498 : Oh, and remember, I'm not allowed to buy back jettons, so don't go getting any hair-brained ideas about trying to make a living off of this Pit fighting craze.
11499 : The current exchange rate is: 1 % = # [jetton/jettons] 1 % = # [jetton/jettons]

11507 : Let's see... It says here that you currently have # [jetton/jettons].
11508 : Whoa there. You don't have enough jettons to purchase that.
11509 : Thanks for stopping by. I'll be seeing you around, %!
11510 : Let me see... I can give you # [jetton/jettons] for this amount.
11511 : Do we have a deal? Yes. No.

11520 : After each battle, you must speak with a registration official in order to reflect the results of the previous match.

11521 : Currently, we are holding a Pankration tournament.
11522 : The rules are simple--only the winners of their respective battles advance to the next fight, with the final monster standing declared the victor.

11552 : Which do you choose? Cancel the results. I'll wait a little longer.

11633 : Which would you like me to explain? Nothing. Feral skills. FP. Discipline. Temperament.
11634 : Feral skills is the collective term used when referring to the various abilities and attributes assigned to monsters participating in Pankration.
11635 : Some feral skills have job, monster family, and level restrictions and cannot be assigned to monsters who do not meet certain requirements.
11636 : In addition, most feral skills have levels, with higher-level skills yielding better results. However, keep in mind that there are some feral skills which never increase in level.
11637 : Feral skills will generally improve after a monster's continued participation in Pankration events.
11638 : While most monsters possess no feral skills upon capture, there are rare cases when a subject will already be blessed with one or two skills.
11639 : These special monsters usually are more receptive to additional feral skills, though it is impossible to remove the skills they are born with.
11640 : FP is the abbreviation for feral points. These points are used when assigning feral skills to monsters.
11641 : Assigning a feral skill requires a certain amount of a monster's total FP capacity. Generally speaking, the more powerful a skill, the more FP will be required when assigning it.
11642 : Every monster has a different FP capacity, and once that capacity is reached, additional feral skills can no longer be assigned.
11643 : Discipline describes how seasoned a monster's battle senses are.
11644 : The more disciplined a monster is, the more receptive the beast is to commands during battle.
11645 : Temperament describes the overall nature of a monster.
11646 : Most monsters range from wild to tame, and defensive to aggressive. A monster's temperament greatly affects its battle style.

11652 : Your % does not meet the requirements for adding this feral skill.
11653 : I'm sorry, but a similar feral skill has already been added to this %. I cannot assign this one.
