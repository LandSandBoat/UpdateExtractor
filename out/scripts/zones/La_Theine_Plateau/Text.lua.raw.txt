6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7323 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7324 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7325 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7326 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7327 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7328 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7329 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7330 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7331 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7332 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7333 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7334 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7335 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7336 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7337 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7338 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7339 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7340 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7341 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7342 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7343 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7344 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7345 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7346 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
7347 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
7348 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
7349 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.
7350 : A mysterious power absorbs the malice!
7351 : Please select absorption value. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
7370 : Nothing happens...
7371 : You can feel the warm, moist breath of the maw on your skin.
7372 : An unseen force is drawing you towards the maw.
7373 : A portal has opened within the depths of the maw.
7374 : Raise your %? Yes. No.
7375 : You fit the % into the hollow.
7376 : There is a hollow here in the shape of %.
7377 : The lycopodium is entranced by a sparkling light...
7378 : Your memory is engraved with an image of your surroundings and the fragrance of flowers...
7379 : The ground is sparkling with a strange light.
7380 : The sparkling light seems vaguely familiar to you...
7381 : You sense that a certain trigger may awaken the memories slumbering in your mind.
7382 : The fragrance of the flower sends your senses reeling back to the world of the past...
7383 : The relevant battle data has been recorded in your %.
7384 : An unseen force is drawing you towards the maw.
7385 : Warp to Abyssea - [Dummy/La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Grauberg/Uleguerand]? Proceed. Not yet.
7386 : Warp to [Dummy/the La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/the Tahrongi Canyon/the Buburimu Peninsula/the Valkurm Dunes/the Jugner Forest/South Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/Xarcabard/Qufim Island]? Proceed. Not yet.
7387 : You do not possess %...
7388 : Your body cannot cope with further strain. You must rest for another # [minute/minutes].
7389 : To where will you head? [The past/The present]. Walk of Echoes. Nowhere for now.
7391 : Temple Knights of San d'Oria, friend. We're conducting rescue drills in this valley. You're free to go down; just stay out of the way.
7392 : Rescue drills in progress. Try to stay out of the way.
7393 : Sorry, no time to chat. I'm a little busy right now.
7394 : Nothing to report.
7395 : Head down here if you wish to take part in the rescue drill.
7396 : They're conducting drills up ahead... At least, I think they are.
7397 : Sir! We've looked everywhere, with no luck so far!
7398 : One of the injured soldiers has gone missing! Well, don't just stand there! Help us search!
7399 : Well? Find anything?
7400 : No, nothing, sir!
7401 : He's not here. We'll have to spread out and try to cover more ground.
7402 : Well? Any sign of him?
7403 : What could have happened to him!?
7404 : Hey!
7405 : Hey! Come take a look at this! Quickly!
7406 : Look, a cave! Maybe he went in there!
7407 : Are you in the rescue drill?
7408 : Head to the other side of that valley over there. One of my compatriots will assist you.
7409 : Greetings. I'm Vicorpasse, squad captain in the Temple Knights.
7410 : We are supposed to be conducting rescue drills, but one of our injured soldiers has gone missing. Your assistance in finding him would be appreciated.
7411 : The missing soldier is a new recruit by the name of Ruillont. I just hope nothing's happened to him...
7412 : The San d'Oria Temple Knights are conducting drills in this area. Daily training is essential for the maintenance of an able fighting force, you know.
7413 : Ruillont's sword? Don't look at me; I've nothing of the sort!
7414 : Ruillont's sword? Yes, I was keeping it for him during training.
7415 : What, Ruillont's stuck in a cave? How typical of him to refuse your help...
7416 : Yes, I believe you; I'm sure it's him. Take this to him in there, would you? We'll keep it between you and me.
7417 : Didn't I give you his sword? Just hand it to Ruillont. Don't you lose it!
7418 : What? Ruillont's in that cave? And he doesn't want us to send help, eh? That's my boy! He's an elite in the making, that one!
7419 : Well, the rescue training was a wash, but you helped us find our lost soldier. I think you've earned this %.
7420 : No, really. These drills are naught compared to venturing into one of those caves. Hand that certificate to the knight at the gatehouse, and you'll be done.
7421 : Don't forget to take the % to the knight at the gatehouse.
7422 : Ah, it's you again! My men and I thank you for your help.
7423 : They canceled the rescue drill. Funny how no one's come back up yet...
7424 : Training finished a while ago, and still no one. Something's fishy, here.
7425 : Not here...
7426 : Well? You find it!?
7427 : No good. There's nothing here at all...
7428 : Our captain sure likes to give orders, but I don't see him lifting a finger...
7429 : Hey! It's not here, either!
7430 : Ah, you again. Nothing for you to worry about, j-just move right along.
7431 : Those men should have been back from training by now... I wonder what's keeping them?
7432 : Greetings. traveler. Sorry, I've little time to chat. I must focus on my prayer.
7433 : Ah, the %! Thank you for making such a long journey to bring this! May the Gates of Paradise open to all.
7434 : Please deliver that % to the high priest in the San d'Oria Cathedral.
7435 : My thanks again for your services. May the Gates of Paradise open to all.
7436 : You see a message engraved on the stone:
7437 : This plateau is a land of many features, but by far the most memorable is the Crag of Holla.
7438 : I call it a structure, for I have no other word. It is surely not a rock born of nature, nor does it seem to be a hall built by the gods, as the priestly scholars say.
7439 : Yet there are no seams in its bone-white surface, and it is faintly warm to the touch. But through a fortunate accident, I have found proof of its artificial origins.
7440 : I shall head north to the land of Valdeaunia to verify my findings. I fear this may be the longest, most perilous journey of my life.
7441 : I leave my daughter Enid to find her own path. May the gods watch over her in my stead.   --Gwynham Ironheart, 764 Crystal Era.
7455 : My spirit was imprisoned in darkness, but you have released it! I am called Gerwitz, and you have my thanks.
7456 : You will certainly help stop the blade of the dark god that wanders the Crystal Line and yearns to shed new blood!
7457 : The weapons I wrought are now far from my formless hands, and have gained a will of their own. I forged the axe and sword that you defeated.
7458 : But my scythe has left this land, and seeks even greater power. Should it find it, I fear for the lives of many!
7459 : My soul cannot rest if things are left like this!
7460 : Is that really what's keeping you here, Gerwitz? You mean that the weapon gained a will of its own here in Ordelle all by itself?
7461 : Zeid... How wise you have become! I hid myself when I felt you were near, but it seems you know everything.
7462 : You're right, Zeid. I wanted my soul to migrate, but the fear of losing these memories was too great.
7463 : And that's why you abandoned the path?
7464 : No, that is not all! There are too few who can work with darksteel. All my work was in vain!
7465 : I began to hate even Raogrimm the Talekeeper. I could not accept how everyone must lose all memory when they transmigrate over and over again, while only he inherited their memories. My feelings turned to a deep loathing that refused to leave this world, even after my departure.
7466 : Your soul no longer knows time. You cannot have known that Raogrimm is dead.
7467 : After all, things are different now. They say this is the age of adventurers. Some even wrought things of darksteel. All you accomplished did not go to waste.
7468 : So, thirty years has gone by this quickly...
7469 : That is right. Ours is a world full of pain and suffering, yet there is always hope. How foolish it was to become a prisoner to darkness and stop the flow of your soul's time.
7470 : And I have found an heir to the ways of darkness.
7471 : Hah! How you've changed, Zeid.
7472 : I have absolute faith that [he/she] can shatter the blade of death.
7473 : Adventurer, are you ready to stare into the face of death? Then, return whence you first were recognized as a follower of darkness.
7474 : Wait, Zeid. Tell me this: has the new Talekeeper made himself known?
7475 : Yes. Indeed, the one who inherits all memory has come.
7476 : Then, tell him this: lead our people away from the pits of fear and hatred.
7477 : ...
7478 : Adventurer, I leave you this armor of my crafting. Please...stop the blade of the dark one!
7479 : You cannot carry any more %. Try again later.
7480 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
7481 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7482 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7483 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7491 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7492 : Something about this patch of ground alerts your thief instincts.
7493 : You need % to dig here.
7494 : There is nothing else of interest here.
7495 : (dig...dig...dig...dig)
7496 : You find an old chest!
7497 : However, your % breaks.
7498 : Hey! What do you think you're doing, finding the trrreasure chest before me!?
7499 : Rrright, move it or lose it. I'll be the one to open it.
7500 : There might be some kinda nasty trrrap just waiting to spring on a kitten like you.
7501 : ...Rauuugh! Got it open! Now, let's take a look at the treasure...
7502 : ...Huh? This is a poor haul... Some musty old armor, some velvet mantles and...ah! A golden scepter! This will go for a good price!
7503 : But this... This is not what I expected at all... There's something strange going on here...
7504 : Well, well. It seems we have some uninvited guests...
7505 : You two! Stay where you are!
7506 : I've seen that face before!
7507 : Who would've thought someone would get here before us?
7508 : There are only two of them... We should take care of this before it becomes a problem.
7509 : Wait, I know these people. They helped me with a little task at the Tenshodo.
7510 : I thought this might happen, but... For the two of you to make it this far, it would seem that not all thieves are totally incompetent these days.
7511 : Would you mind introducing your friends to the rest of us, Vauderame?
7512 : Of course. This is Nanaa Mihgo of Windurst, and %, an adventurer [of San d'Oria/of Bastok/also of Windurst].
7513 : Linzaza, you mentioned someone asked for your signature again. I'm assuming that that someone is standing before you now.
7514 : Yes, you're rightaru. I need to be more of a villainy-willain, and start being suspicious of people.
7515 : Now that you mention it, I rolled dice with [her/him].
7516 : And that Mithra over there was the one who came to my hideout.
7517 : ...More than half of us have been unmasked. I'm going to take care of this while there are no witnesses...
7518 : You forget, Kanika. Atarefaunet's band is no more. We are now known as Vauderame's Knights.
7519 : I waited twenty years for the former Marquis to remember everything. All that is left is to restore the glory of our lost kingdom.
7520 : But Vauderame, these guys have seen what's in the chest. If we don't knock 'em off now, there's bound to be trouble later.
7521 : The royal scepter has already found its way into that Mithra's pocket. Even if her knowledge of its history is lacking, she still has a nose for value.
7522 : Not one of you has changed, even after all these years. Luckily, I was prepared for this.
7523 : ...Take care of it.
7524 : ...This is all of it, Vauderame. The whole set of knights' equipment is here, just as it used to be. The smell of the past still clings to it.
7525 : It will be gone by the time we reach Tavnazia. Mightaru be a good idea to lose that tummy-wummy on the way, as well.
7526 : I'll get rid of the rust. I brought the gear with me.
7527 : ...Are you sure about those two? It's not like you to leave loose ends, even if their memory has been erased.
7528 : Mithra might seem wild and free, but they are deeply tied to one another. If we kill this one now, others will come looking for revenge. They will chase us to the ends of Vana'diel.
7529 : Then there is this adventurer. [He/She] looks like someone I did away with in another time...
7530 : So you're going to leave that % here? It's almost as if you want [him/her] to come after you.
7531 : ...Perhaps you're right. A foothold into the country I have spent twenty years restoring... Maybe my ego demands a witness to all that I have accomplished.
7532 : ...Vauderame. We will await you and the Marquis in our homeland.
7533 : I will join you as soon as I can. Let us meet again in a newborn country...
7534 : My homeland, Tavnazia.
7535 : Hey! The catnap is over!
7536 : You're finally up... We were caught by a trrrap on the treasure chest and sent into dreamland. It took me by surprise.
7537 : I thought I had disarmed the trap, but... Now my head is all woozy and I can't think straight.
7538 : ...Anyway, there was nothing of great value in the chest.
7539 : The thief boots I found in there...I already put them in your pack. They're a little worse for wear, but being part of Atarefaunet's treasure, they should be worth a bit.
7540 : All that's left are a couple of gems, which I claim for myself. I have those two kittens to feed--you know how it is.
7541 : Time to leave this place behind. Although I would like to see Vauderame's face when he opens the chest to find it empty...
7542 : ...Hmmm. I get the feeling there's something important I'm forgetting...
7543 : If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess % and have a high enough job level.
7544 : You can rent a chocobo for # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
7545 : You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.
7546 : If you still want one, it will cost you # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
7547 : Do you wish to rent a chocobo? Yes, I do. No, thank you.
7548 : You don't have enough gil.
7549 : You cannot obtain the %. Come back after sorting your inventory.
7550 : Would you be so kind as to deliver her to [the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?
7551 : Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo. First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of %.
7552 : Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of # Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have # Allied Notes.
7553 : Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
7554 : I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with %. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?
7555 : Roar!
7556 : Grrroar!
7557 : Grrrgroooar! Grrrgroooarrr!
7558 : Grrroar! Grrrgroooar!
7559 : Groar! Grrroar!
7560 : Roar! Groar!
7561 : Roar!
7562 : Grrr...
7563 : Happy-wappy New Year to you, [sir/ma'am]! And apparently...commiserations!
7564 : Happy-wappy New Year to you, [sir/ma'am]! And apparently...a strong tiger has appeared in the north!
7565 : Oooh, you're sure to like this! He says, Beforrre me stands a person-werson who'll be swimming in fantarustic forrrtune this year!
7566 : Oooh, nice! He says, You're going be in for a grrreataru year with oodles of elation!
7567 : That was, Justaru the rrright amount of happiness is going to be coming your way!
7568 : That translates to, You win some, you lose some. But on the whole, there's no rrreason-weason why you should be pessimistic!
7569 : Uh-oh! That was, You'll need to dig deepy-weep for some luck of your own this yearrr!
7570 : Hrrrm... Rather than interpretaru that, let me just say, whatever happens this year, always rememberrr to keep your chinny-win up!
7571 : A fabulous-wabulous yearrr to you, adventurer!
7572 : Grrr... (Boy, it sure looks hungry.)
7573 : Grrr...Grrr... (It doesn't look like that was enough.)
7574 : Grrr! Grrr! Roar! (It looks quite satisfied.)
7575 : The [orange/1/2/3/red/red/blue/blue/yellow/yellow/green/green/indigo/indigo/violet/violet] light... I can feel its power run through me.
7576 : Come, %.  Follow me...
7577 : Carbuncle vanished off in the direction of the La Theine Plateau.
7578 : Carbuncle vanished off to another area in the La Theine Plateau.
7579 : The % jumps in your hands.
7580 : Ahahahahaha! I can sense the power of the ring! Get yourself moving [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7581 : Ahahahahaha! Don't slow down now, slacker! The readings are coming from the [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7582 : Ahahahahaha! You're getting close now! I can feel the ring's power from the next area!
7583 : Ahahahahaha! You're almost on top of it! It's somewhere in this area!
7584 : Surrounded by these pillars, you feel a strange energy.
7585 : Your % shines brightly, but something seems to be missing.
7586 : Your % shines brightly. A voice echoes, Come, raise it higher!
7587 : You can now become a summoner.
7588 : You can now summon Carbuncle.
7589 : Thank you, %. My name is Carbuncle. I am one of several new forces here in Vana'diel.
7590 : I became a crystal, was divided into shards, and fell into the hands of beasts and people alike...as the world changed around me.
7591 : And then, I knew. I knew that you needed me.
7592 : That's why I'll lend you a little of my power. I'll fight by your side, and watch over you always.
7593 : I demand you perform a labor: visit the ancient beings that sleep in faraway lands and places of legend.
7594 : Vana'diel is the world in which you live. You should see the true Vana'diel with your own eyes.
7595 : I will extend a bridge. A bridge between the people of the present, and beings of ages past.
7596 : You sense something strange...
7597 : The air around you is slightly stagnant...
7598 : The air around you has suddenly changed!
7599 : Don't you have something better to do right now?
7600 : %... A single fragment of light. The way in which it shines suggests that it is resonating with something...
7601 : Do you remove the %? Yes. No.
7602 : It is an oddly shaped stone monument. A shining stone is embedded in it, but cannot be removed...
7603 : You have already obtained this monument's %. Try searching for another.
7604 : You have obtained all of the fragments. You must hurry to the ruins of the ancient shrine!
7605 : You have obtained %! You now have all 8 fragments of light!
7606 : It is an ancient Zilart monument.
7607 : MONUMENT BOSS POP'N FRESH!
7608 : Touching the red jewel has infuriated the Opo-opos of the forest. It would be wise to leave immediately.
7609 : You put down the %.
7610 : Opo! Opo-opo-opo!      Oppopopo-opo!
7611 : Oppopo! Ohpopo!
7612 : Opopo!
7613 : The Opo-opo is holding something.
7614 : There must be a way to soothe the weary soul who once guarded this monument...
7615 : You place % on the monument as an offering.
7616 : ...tha...nk...you...
7617 : Something is lying on the ground.
7618 : The air in this area remains stagnant. You begin to feel sick... It would be wise to leave immediately.
7619 : The % begins to glow.
7620 : You will have to move closer to remove the %.
7621 : A cold wind chills you to the bone.
7622 : The Opo-opos attack!
7623 : Gimme everything ya got in your bag.
7624 : Your offering is refused.
7625 : Leave ya bag and scram.
7626 : You hear a voice from right beneath the surface of the ground.
7627 : You hear a voice coming from somewhere extremely close to the surface of the ground...
7628 : You hear a voice coming from somewhere very close to the surface of the ground...
7629 : You hear a voice coming from somewhere close to the surface of the ground...
7630 : You hear a voice from under the ground...
7631 : You hear a voice coming from somewhere deep under the ground...
7632 : You hear a voice coming from somewhere very deep under the ground...
7633 : You hear a voice coming from somewhere extremely deep under the ground...
7634 : Gimme more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7635 : Gimme more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7636 : Gimme more!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7637 : Gimme more!!!!!!!!!!!!
7638 : Gimme more!!!!!!!!!!!
7639 : Gimme more!!!!!!!!!!
7640 : Gimme more!!!!!!!!!
7641 : Gimme more!!!!!!!!
7642 : Gimme more!!!!!!!
7643 : Gimme more!!!!!!
7644 : Gimme more!!!!!
7645 : Gimme more!!!!
7646 : Gimme more!!!
7647 : Gimme more!!
7648 : Gimme more!
7649 : Ah, you must be the adventurer Sir Elmemague spoke of.
7650 : You're finally here. Our opponent is a heinous criminal. Your cooperation in this matter is highly appreciated.
7651 : What word on our quarry?
7652 : Sir! He appears to be resting up within Ordelle's Caves. This is our chance to bring the knave to justice!
7653 : This is merely a trap. A ruse to draw us into a battlefield of his choosing. Who knows how many allies lie in ambush within?
7654 : An ambush...
7655 : Do not underestimate this villain. I know this breed; they are wily and treacherous. It is not unlikely that this thief of ours is a feared member of the underworld who has survived through countless battles and tight spots.
7656 : What in Altana's name was that burst of light?
7657 : No matter. I must set out for San d'Oria without delay. Everything depends on this mission's success.
7658 : Who is this strange character?
7659 : Sir! He is the suspected thief!
7660 : Temple Knights! Have I wandered into a trap!?
7661 : A Royal Knight? But there's something different that I cannot quite...? You there, state your name!
7662 : I have no name to give to the likes of you!
7663 : This man bears no resemblance to the sketch I was shown. What is going on here?
7664 : My apologies, sir! He was acting so suspiciously, I just assumed...
7665 : A wild goose chase. I should have known this was too easy.
7666 : The others must have gone on ahead. What a sorry state of affairs.
7667 : Ah, now I see! You are my guides, disguised as Temple Knights. You've come to lead me in from the storm, am I correct?
7668 : Storm? There was no storm. What were you doing out here, anyway?
7669 : I was on my way to deliver the Scepter Royaulais to the Chateau d'Oraguille. You should already know this. Now, enough of this meaningless chitchat. Take me to the capital immediately.
7670 : The Scepter Royaulais?
7671 : You have it on your person? Quickly now, hand it over.
7672 : I think not, my good sir. My mission is to deliver the Scepter Royaulais to the king's brother, Prince Fellenant, and him alone.
7673 : Where is it!? The scepter is gone!
7674 : Clap this man in irons. He'll be accompanying us back to the chateau.
7675 : What is the meaning of this!? I am the vassal of King Raigegue R D'Oraguille! You will show me the proper respect or your fate will be most unpleasant!
7676 : Take your hands off me, I say!
7677 : That man... He has a role to play in all of this, I am certain.
7678 : Adventurer, I regret dragging you all the way out here for nothing. Feel free to be on your way; we'll take it from here.
7679 : Oh, and please mention to that guard that we won't be needing any further assistance after all.
7680 : You have found the villain who stole the Scepter Royaulais? There is no mistake this time?
7681 : Sir! He exactly matches the man in the sketches we have!
7682 : Millechairale is no thief! Please, let me go and persuade him to give up the scepter!
7683 : Stand down, citizen. You know the penalty for interfering with a Temple Knight investigation.
7684 : I beg you! Listen to me!
7685 : Back off, I say!
7686 : Sir! The thief has emerged from another cave exit!
7687 : Dash it all! After him! There's no escape this time!
7688 : Simple-minded buffoons.
7689 : Vijartal...
7690 : I...you misunderstand! I am not here for any Bastoker... Come, we must rescue Millechairale while those fools are distracted!
7691 : We should split up to widen our search. Vijartal, %, please take that tunnel over there.
7692 : Come to think of it, this is where...
7693 : We've finally found you. You are Millechairale, I presume? Your sister and brother-in-law have been looking for you.
7694 : You...!
7695 : I was instructed to give you this.
7696 : The Scepter Royaulais...
7697 : I do not...?
7698 : Please, just take it! I have been requested to give this to the first knight I meet on this day, at this time, in this place.
7699 : One moment, young man. Why me? Who asked you to do such a thing?
7700 : Vijartal Caphieux.
7701 : Vijartal...?
7702 : A secret legacy has been passed down by word of mouth in my family for generations. It is an oath made to a distant ancestor. A duty that I must fulfill.
7703 : An ancestor? You mean that you...
7704 : Yes. My sister and I bear the Caphieux name. Our family is that of the famous hero, Vijartal Caphieux.
7705 : Which would mean that I made this request myself? I would need the Pierre Errante of the Scepter Royaulais to return to my own time...
7706 : Millechairale!
7707 : Roido...
7708 : You had us worried... You shouldn't have put yourself in such danger just to fulfill that oath of yours.
7709 : I am sorry for the trouble I've caused. But it was the will of Vijartal Caphieux. I wanted to answer the request of my most respected ancestor, no matter what it took.
7710 : ...
7711 : They have found me!
7712 : Quickly! You must flee before they arrive!
7713 : Vijartal, %. Take Millechairale and get out of here. You should be able to escape from another tunnel deeper in the caves.
7714 : Roido!
7715 : Are you insane!? If you stay here, things will not go lightly for you!
7716 : Please, hurry! There's no time to debate the issue!
7717 : Why do you do this...?
7718 : Even if I am not of the same race or bloodline, I need no reason to protect my family!
7719 : Roido...
7720 : Bastok, San d'Oria--none of that is important! Don't you understand? Surely you have someone who you would die to protect, no matter the consequences?
7721 : !!!
7722 : For me, those people are Phillone and Millechairale. Now please, just go!
7723 : Wait... There is one way to save all of us...
7724 : I see what she means now. The most important thing is understanding...
7725 : Vijartal?
7726 : Do not resist the Temple Knights when they come. Leave everything to me.
7727 : You have nowhere left to run! Hand over the Scepter Royaulais!
7728 : Roido, you have made me realize that Bastokers are not to be so easily dismissed. There is something to Prince Fellenant's reasoning after all. I see now why I cannot allow him to be assassinated.
7729 : It is just like the last time... These caves are responding in some way to the Pierre Errante. Did you know that this place was once known as the Shrine of Endless Travels?
7730 : Vijartal...?
7731 : There is nothing to fear. Please let Phillone know that I need no thanks; I already have my reward. I am the Obsidian Bolt, such deeds are my reason for living...!
7732 : We have you now, thief! Surrender quietly!
7733 : He's vanished! Where is the knight that accompanied you? Sorcery...!?
7734 : Wait...this is the Scepter Royaulais!
7735 : Now we have the thief and the scepter in our possession.
7736 : ...
7737 : I have my suspicions that you aided the thief in his crime, but for the moment I will let that small detail pass. We will see what the villain confesses, however.
7738 : This can't be happening. I've failed to protect Millechairale...
7739 : Sir Elmemague has taken the suspect to the chateau for questioning. It's back to regular training drills for us.
7740 : We have received a report from Sir Elmemague that the suspect we apprehended wasn't the criminal after all. We must be ready to send word to the chateau if any other suspicious characters are sighted.
7741 : Thanks to our effective training drills, we were able to capture the new suspect with little trouble. Although I do wonder where that other knight disappeared to...
7742 : The suspect appears to have taken refuge within Ordelle's Caves. We will follow our training drills and stick to our posts!
7743 : Our rigorous training drills have shown their worth. That preparation honed the skills we needed to handle the situation this day.
7744 : Another suspect has been discovered in Ordelle's Caves! We must be ready to move at a moment's notice! Take care to stay out of our way.
7745 : We have succeeded not once, but twice at capturing a suspected criminal. I'm certain that this will be the site for developing even more effective training exercises in the future.
7746 : I have spoken with Sir Elmemague. Narvecaint is currently monitoring the suspect's movements from the entrance to the caves.
7747 : Well, I suppose we can regard this as an adequate performance. It will still be necessary to further refine our soldiers' training... However, this was an excellent opportunity for the knights to practice their skills in a real-life situation.
7748 : Another chance to test the effectiveness of our training in almost exactly the same setting! This time, I expect perfect coordination and execution from my men.
7749 : Hmm, there is still room for improvement. They need to work on communication to facilitate speedier responses... Lady Curilla will not be pleased.
7750 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7751 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7752 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7753 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7754 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7755 : Now, listen close...
7756 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7757 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7758 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7759 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7760 : .........listen......
7761 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7762 : Do you want to hear a story? No thank you. Let's hear one.

7767 : The telepoint has been shattered into a thousand pieces...
7768 : Investigate further? Yes. No.
7769 : Have you made your preparations?
7770 : Preparations complete? Yes. Not yet.
7771 : Hm...? Someone seems to have arrived here before us.
7772 : %, state your reason for coming here.
7773 : You! What are you doing here?
7774 : Calm down, Ayame. [He's/She's] an adventurer. It's [his/her] job to go adventuring.
7775 : We're here to investigate something. It could get pretty dangerous, so I suggest taking a few steps back if you know what's good for you.
7776 : Why, Cid. What business do you have here today?
7777 : Well, if it isn't little Wolfgang. How have you been?
7778 : We're here to check out the Crystal Line. Recently I've been receiving some very strange readings from this area.
7779 : According to the data retrieved by a Republican party that visited here last month, the once stable energy flow has begun to fluctuate.
7780 : I've never seen such high readings...
7781 : The flow of energy is so overwhelming that the Telepoint you see over there was shattered to pieces! And now there are reports that a giant beast appeared over the sea, just to the north of Delkfutt's Tower.
7782 : I have a bad feeling that these two events are connected, and that they're warning us of something worse to come.
7783 : ... I understand that research inclines you to pursue these matters. However, I ask that you leave the investigation to the Duchy.
7784 : Eh? So the Duchy knows the cause of all these strange phenomena?
7785 : Not exactly. We have numerous parties investigating the situation. However, many of those sent into the field have...vanished.
7786 : We cannot allow any more accidents. The damage to Vana'diel would be great if we were to lose such an important engineer as you, Cid.
7787 : Hah!  Let me guess... The scientists back in Jeuno told you to get rid of all those who got in their way.
7788 : Who do they think they are!? Come to think of it, I have good reason to believe that it's those lunatics that are causing all this trouble!
7789 : Wh-what is going on!?
7790 : A moment, %!
7791 : Common rumor has it that one can meet here with the terrestrial avatar Carbuncle. Could this be true...?
7792 : Carbuncle, bringer of rainbows! I am Tenzen of the Far East, sent here across the seas at the behest of Phoenix!
7793 : The Keeper of the Apocalypse has come to Vana'diel, and four of the mothercrystals are besieged by darkness!
7794 : Yet in the face of this crisis, Bahamut and Diabolos do nothing to defend them.
7795 : Diabolos draws souls into his dreamworld to shelter people from the Emptiness.
7796 : And Bahamut rallies his wyrms for the destruction of every last person on Vana'diel in the name of some ancient pact!
7797 : Carbuncle. We all carry the curse of Promathia within us...
7798 : And it is not within our power to lift this bane...
7799 : But I cannot accept this as justification for genocide! We were born as a part of fate's design, and we will live the lives we have been given!
7800 : You, who have brought the soul of Phoenix across the waves. And you, who carries the blessings of the mothercrystal.
7801 : You have finally come into contact with the will of Promathia...
7802 : I knew that even should the past be ground into dust, there would come a time when people would uncover the truth.
7803 : No matter how tightly sealed, as long as it exists alongside the mothercrystal, Promathia's will shall one day awaken.
7804 : That is why I have come to guide you. Guide you to the power of the slumbering gods.
7805 : As many people as possible must possess this strength to prevent the awakening of the Twilight God.
7806 : The slumbering gods... You speak of the great avatars that dream away their existence in every corner of Vana'diel?
7807 : ...!?
7808 : I sense that Phoenix does not approve of my actions.
7809 : He who tries to save the world and he who tries to save mankind... Bahamut and Diabolos would also surely oppose me if they knew of my plans.
7810 : Every time the power of the avatars is granted to a person, it hastens the awakening of the sleeping gods.
7811 : If the siphoning of energy continues, the boundaries of the crystal world they protect will shatter, and their true forms will manifest upon this world of Vana'diel.
7812 : And then a furious battle will ensue between the terrestrial avatars and the newly awakened gods.
7813 : But I believe that this is the only option remaining to prevent Promathia's rebirth.
7814 : The awakening of Promathia draws near.
7815 : With the Keeper of the Apocalypse now among us, all that remains is for the Gates of Paradise to be opened...
7816 : I don't understand. Has not the pursuit for the Gates of Paradise all been the result of Promathia's curse?
7817 : If so, then everything has been for the purpose of awakening the Twilight God...
7818 : Carbuncle! Destroying his minion ourselves is the only way to save the children of Altana!
7819 : I beg of you to lend us the strength we need! Please tell us where to find the Keeper of the Apocalypse!
7820 : You shine so brilliantly... I know that guiding light well.
7821 : It is the light standing at your side, merging with your own, that so fills you with hope.
7822 : Very well. I will grant you my assistance.
7823 : You will help us!?
7824 : Thirty years ago, I sensed the birth of the Keeper of the Apocalypse.
7825 : After a number of years the presence faded, and I can no longer sense its location.
7826 : However, the fiery bird of resurrection will continue to lead your steps on this journey.
7827 : And that is why I will lend my strength to Phoenix's diminished soul...
7828 : You have our thanks! Bringer of rainbows, I am delirious with joy at your words!
7829 : Do not rejoice just yet, Tenzen. The energy I will share with Phoenix does not exist here.
7830 : It can be found in the city built by the Kuluu on the outskirts of the Zilartian capital. A place known as Pso'Xja.
7831 : The power we granted the Kuluu in ancient times should still be sealed within that city.
7832 : %. Venture deep within the ruins and open Carbuncle's gate. With the knowledge you now hold, you should be able to operate the device that lies within.
7833 : As I have no strength for battle, this is the best that I can do... But I am sure you will find it helpful.
7834 : Carbuncle! We are in your debt!
7835 : %! This is the first terrestrial avatar to aid us in our cause. For the others, it will be welcome news indeed!
7836 : But first we must secure the energy that is sealed within the ruins of Pso'Xja. Let us rendezvous before the gate of Carbuncle!
7837 : The nest's owner appears in a flurry of rage!
7838 : There is a broken egg on the ground here. Perhaps there is a nest in the boughs of this tree.
7839 : No more goodies 'round here! Me go looks somewheres else!
7840 : Where next one?
7841 : We no lose to smelly Moogles this time!
7842 : Need more cards!
7843 : ......?
7844 : Lookin' for cards in all the wrong places.
7845 : This chocobo riding is a lot more painful than it looks. I think I'm starting to chafe.
7846 : I wonder how much I could get for this at the local pawnshop...
7847 : Would somebody explain to me why we're collecting these things again?
7848 : Digging holes in the dirt... Yeah, this is my idea of excitement.
7849 : % digs up # strange trading [card/cards] and places [it/them] in the treasure pool.
7850 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7851 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!
7852 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7853 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip the %, kupo!
7854 : I can't work my moogle magic while you're involved in other events, kupo!
7855 : Time elapsed: # [hour/hours] (Vana'diel time) # [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] (Earth time)
7856 : %. While I'm sure you are in the middle of some important mission, could you spare a few moments for me?
7857 : You know about the sleeping gods...the avatars that guard the protocrystals?
7858 : I am as different to those beings as fire is to water, and yet we share the same desire to protect Vana'diel.
7859 : That is why I aided the blossoming of their power within you and your fellow adventurers.
7860 : I believed that if their aspects fought beside you, they would learn from an existence that had lost the gift of eternity.
7861 : Finally, the sleeping gods begin to stir from their slumber.
7862 : Will they consent to join us in our roles as guardians of Vana'diel?
7863 : I hope to ask this very question to an old friend of mine who resides at the Full Moon Fountain. A very, very old friend...
7864 : But in order to wake him, I need a vast source of energy.
7865 : I hope to visit the Full Moon Fountain, and ask the sleeping Fenrir to see what the future holds.
7866 : But in order to wake him from his weakened torpor, I need an energy source of immense proportions.
7867 : That is where you come in. If you could gather the power of the sleeping gods and bring it to the Full Moon Fountain, we might have a chance.
7868 : If you use this % to enter the protocrystals, you will be closer to the true avatars than anyone has ever been before. But be warned: the ensuing battle will be that much more difficult.
7869 : You and your fellow adventurers are the only ones capable of besting the six sleeping gods and tapping the elemental energy that they wield.
7870 : I set this task before you, %. There is little time to waste...
7871 : Gather the elemental energy from the six sleeping gods and make your way to the Full Moon Fountain...
7872 : Then we shall see if my ancient friend can be roused...
7873 : Thank you for bringing the shell of my avatar, %.
7874 : I thought that you would never return to this place. I threatened your life, even if it was for the purpose of defeating the sleeping gods.
7875 : But you fought me with every ounce of your strength, and bent the power of those slumbering deities to your will.
7876 : That is what saved us at the end.
7877 : Unfortunately, it did not have the desired effect...
7878 : You were never meant to submit to the will of the sleeping gods. And I will never lose my faith in the children of Vana'diel.
7879 : Even those ancient beings will one day learn a great truth from mortals.
7880 : So I want for you to have this. Lend me your strength again, %. We will succeed in waking my old friend.
7881 : %. I have need of your help.
7882 : My old friend at the Full Moon Fountain calls for me.
7883 : The more power we siphon from the sleeping gods, the closer they edge towards wakefulness. But there is no other way.
7884 : They will bring battle to us once more. And when you can no longer control them, you must fight with me as before.
7885 : You are the only one I can ask to bear their power.
7886 : Take this. Use it to enter the six protocrystals.
7887 : Good luck, %. Time, as ever, grows short...
7888 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7889 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!
7890 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7891 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip % or %, kupo!
7892 : The compass reads # yalms.
7893 : The compass is pointing [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].

7896 : You cannot check any more points.
7898 : Kweh!
7899 : There are chocobo tracks on the ground here.
7900 : There is treasure somewhere in the vicinity of this marker...
7901 : K-KWEHHH!!! (You're right on top of it!)

7960 : The % is ripped violently to pieces!
7961 : Greetings, fair traveler. My people would entreat thy assistance, and offer rich reward in return. Thou shouldst speak with my sister Callisto, who abides in Grauberg's Witchfire Glen.
7962 : Hark! Our foe lurks thither. How wouldst thou proceed?
7963 : How will you proceed? Withdraw. Charge in. Scout the enemy. Check weapon.

8050 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
8051 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
8052 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
8053 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
8054 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
8055 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
8056 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
8057 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
8058 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
8059 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
8060 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
8061 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
8062 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
8063 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
8064 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8065 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
8066 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8067 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
8068 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
8069 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
8070 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
8071 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
8072 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
8073 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
8074 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
8075 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
8076 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.
8077 : Your fate is currently entwined in the swirling mists of [Promyvion - Holla/Promyvion - Dem/Promyvion - Mea].

11186 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11187 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
11188 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
11189 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
11190 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
11191 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
11192 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
11193 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
11194 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
11195 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
11196 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
11197 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
11198 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
11199 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
11200 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
11201 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
11202 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
11203 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
11204 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
11205 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
11206 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
11207 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
11208 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!
11209 : Choose a location: West Ronfaure. East Ronfaure. La Theine Plateau. Valkurm Dunes. Jugner Forest. Batallia Downs. North Gustaberg. South Gustaberg. Konschtat Highlands. Pashhow Marshlands.

11210 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there by %, kupo!
11211 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there, kupo!
11212 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
11213 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
11214 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
11215 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
11216 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
11217 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
11218 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
11219 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
11220 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
11221 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
11222 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
11223 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
11224 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
11225 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
11227 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
11228 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
11229 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
11230 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
11231 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
11232 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
11233 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
11234 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
11235 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
11236 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
11237 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

11256 : Hi there! I'm  your friendly neighborhood smile sergeant! I'm in charge of running the [beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.
11257 : I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too! You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?
11258 : What will you do? Undertake training. Hear an explanation. What's the qualifying time? What's the fastest time? Nothing.
11259 : Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don't have %. Well, that's just too bad!
11260 : It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem! The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!
11261 : The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.
11262 : But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree. The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!
11263 : Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!
11264 : With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da! Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.
11265 : The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor! When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. Smile helpers are posted at each, so you can't miss them!
11266 : Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage. The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?
11267 : I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.
11268 : Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!
11269 : What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!
11270 : Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!
11271 : One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled. But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?
11272 : So far, the fastest time in this area is # minute[/s] # second[/s]. Wow! And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is %. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?
11273 : We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within # minute[/s] # second[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young [wolf/vixen] like you, surely! And if you manage a time quicker than # minute[/s] # second[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?
11274 : Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad... But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!
11275 : At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of # gil from each participant. All proceeds go towards presents for the children. Oh, won't you think of the children? <Sniffle>...
11276 : Give to the children? I live to give! Charity begins at home.
11277 : But of course! First, I'll need you to lend me your %... Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!
11278 : You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated. Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?
11279 : There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you. If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>
11280 : So, are you ready-steady? [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO! Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!
11281 : Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.
11282 : But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!
11283 : Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness. Let's start from the top, shall we?
11284 : Oh, what're you doing here? Aren't you in the middle of a run right now? Couldn't stand to be parted from your favorite smile sergeant, maybe? Teehee!
11285 : What will you do? Hear an explanation. Where're the smile helpers again? Cancel the training. Nothing.
11286 : Awww... These rivulets of tears streaming down my face... B-but it's okay... You have your own reasons for quitting, and I understand... <Sob>
11287 : Welcome back! Let's check your time, shall we? You cleared the course in # minute[/s] # second[/s].
11288 : Oh my Goddess! You've set a new record for this area! Hooray! Somebody, break out the fireworks!
11289 : You've successfully qualified! Yay! Here's a little something to commemorate this marvelous achievement.
11290 : You obtain %!
11291 : Ah, just the knowledge that there're capable adventurers like you around helps me sleep better at night. The children...they're in good hands... <Sob>
11292 : You did just fine, but don't be resting on those laurels, you hear? As we smilebringers say, there's always a bigger, brighter smile to be had!
11293 : Oh no! I'm afraid your time falls short of qualification! As much as I want to give you a passing grade, headquarters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
11294 : Oh no! Please don't be mad, but...I forgot to record your time. I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this scatterbrain of a smile sergeant...
11295 : It might surprise you to learn this, but even the toughest--grrrrrr!--and roughest of us smilebringers need rest and relaxation. Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!
11296 : Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, work hard, play hard is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too. After you complete a run with a qualifying time--yay!--you're required to rest up until the next day (Vana'diel time).
11297 : Awww, seeing the way you're simply bursting with enthusiasm makes me want to cry tears of joy. But you have to be cruel to be kind. No more training until tomorrow, young [man/lady]! No siree!

11340 : Am I correct in assuming that you're %?
11341 : Are you %? The one and only! ...
11342 : Truly!?
11343 : My name is Ragemont, and I was told that you might show--
11344 : Aaargh! C-confound it!
11345 : I must ask you to disregard these abrupt outbursts. This pain is an inseparable part of inter-dimensional travel.
11346 : Though I'm made to understand that people of this world do not experience it.
11347 : Oh, you've not been informed? Then it would be my pleasure to explain.
11348 : In crossing over to this world, residents of Abyssea suffer from a phenomenon wherein their strength is halved. Devivification, 'tis called, though the exact science of it remains beyond our fathoming.
11349 : Curiously, the reverse is known to occur when people of your world cross over to ours.
11350 : And it is exactly for this reason that you're so important in our struggle. Only with the help of your enhanced powers could we hope to subdue the Abyssean menace and set the world to rights.
11351 : Ah, but I do ramble. Should you have any questions, my knowledge is at your disposal.
11352 : What will you ask about? Devivification. The reverse effect. Nothing in particular.
11353 : As I had mentioned prior, the journey here from Abyssea causes our strength to become halved.
11354 : In practice, it's as if we're in a constant state of weakness. Adding insult to injury, an unbearable chafing sensation assails us without warning.
11355 : Sounds bothersome, doesn't it? Yet we do what we must. The pain that ensues after each crossing compares not to the eternal death of our world.
11356 : Not everyone is possessed of the ability to traverse dimensions, mind you. How it's decided that one child will be born with the gift but not another, mortals such as ourselves may never learn the truth of it.
11357 : No rewards for guessing correctly, but the reverse effect is referred to as vivification. The process can be described in terms of plants.
11358 : Imagine yourself as a sapling, and Abyssea a pot many times larger than you're accustomed to, filled with humus-rich soil. As the sapling thrives in such an auspicious environment, blooming forth with flowers beauteous and many, so too will your strength and abilities flourish in Abyssea.
11359 : Only those of your world with the ability to cross over to ours may attain the strength that is needed to battle the Abyssean hordes. Do you understand now why your aid is so valuable to us?
11360 : I see...
11361 : Ah, yes. With regards to the %...
11362 : Beyond this cavernous maw lies another La Theine Plateau, though you will find little resemblance beyond the name.
11363 : I must say, it eases the heart to stand beneath a sky that isn't a constant and bloody reminder of encroaching death...
11364 : Ah, once again I must apologize. I am wont to become lost in such sentimental thoughts on occasion.
11365 : The La Theine of Abyssea is no longer the picturesque, tranquil plateau we stand upon. Seeing its former beauty restored is my fervent desire.
11366 : There exists an Abyssean monster that has been a great scourge to us--a Gigas of fearsome stature and savagery who dons a golden helm.
11367 : Defeating this creature would be tantamount to laying the foundation stones for our dreams of peace.
11368 : Yet a foundation requires many a heavy stone to be laid if a sturdy tower is to be built. More often than not, though, it feels as if we go about constructing this tower of dreams bereft of an architectural plan.
11369 : And so we come to this world, seeking the aid of brave souls such as you. By ourselves, we stand not a sliver of a chance against the Abyssean hordes.
11370 : Egads, I've lost track of time yet again. I must away before I'm missed. Before I take my leave, however, I would offer you a few words of advice.
11371 : You are not alone. There are others of this world who have been blessed with the same gift as you.
11372 : And do tread warily when first you set foot on Abyssean soil. For though our worlds may bear some resemblance, the difference may well determine life and death.
11373 : 'Til we meet again...fare you well!
11374 : ...
11375 : The stranger stares intently at %.
11376 : You must be %.
11377 : The name's Oak. Knotty Oak.
11378 : I know you're expecting to see Ragemont, but I'm afraid he won't be coming by anymore.
11379 : He saved my life in battle, but paid for it with his own. For this gift, I intend to carry on his legacy.
11380 : I've heard of your exploits in our world, %. You've proven yourself a true friend to the cause. Thank you.
11381 : Now this isn't much, but I think you'll find it useful.
11382 : %. Foreign-dimensioners are known to have an affinity for it.
11383 : Whether we've gotten closer to fulfilling Ragemont's wish, no one can say.
11384 : But I believe that his meeting with you will count for something.
11385 : Sorry, but I was never good with words.
11386 : This is one peaceful world you got here. It's good to see exactly what it is we're fighting to reclaim...
11387 : Arrrg. Fancy seein' someone in these parts.
11388 : Hmm? Would ye happen t' be %, by any chance?
11389 : Passin' strange... Thought I'd recognize ye on sight, but perhaps age has clouded me eye. Now that we finally meet, though, I do sense somethin' diff'rent about ye.
11390 : Ye're wonderin' how I discern such things, aye? Well, a man don't live t' me age without learnin' a trick or two...although experience don't account fer all, t' be fair.
11391 : What's the matter? Ye look like ye've just been t' Davy Jones's locker an' back.
11392 : Let me take a wild stab: ye're acquainted with the me o' this world. Aye, ye've got an exprrression that says I know what ye know, matey.
11393 : Hmm... Curse me fer a fool father, but that sparkle o' determination in yer eyes puts me in mind o' me dear daughter.
11394 : It seems I've gone an' taken leave o' me mannerrrs, like folk o' me trade are wont t' do.
11395 : Thank ye fer makin' the journey here. Name's Gilgamesh. I be in the business o' liberrratin' cargo from those as don't need it an' givin' it to those who do--usually meself an' me boys. Call it philanthropy. Or call it piracy if ye like.
11396 : Nothin' compares t' glidin' upon the waves on the high seas, feelin' the caress o' the wind as she fills yer sails with her sweet brrreath. Aye, the unfettered life o' a pirate be the life fer me.
11397 : But all o' that an' more was taken away when me world Abyssea took grievously ill.
11398 : Aye, everythin' we knew crumbled away like ol' hard tack what even the ship rats won't touch. An' it got me t' thinkin'. Piratin' be tough when t'ain't no more merchants what needs piratin'. So I volunteered me services t' the resistance effort, wantin' to do me part fer mankind, ye see. I be an officer, in fact...
11399 : That be when the rumors o' ye first reached me, %. The lil' mistress had heard o' ye, too, an' assigned me the task o' measurrrin' yer suitability. So here I be.
11400 : Ask about... Rumors. The lil' mistress. Suitability.
11401 : Yer right audacious feats in our ravaged world've earned ye considerable renown, matey. Thanks t' yer exploits, survivors across areas've learned o' each other's existence. Unity o' purpose is startin' t' be seen again.
11402 : Truth be told, stubborn as we were, at first it was difficult fer us t' admit that we needed outside help t' survive.
11403 : But prrride offers small comfort when loved ones are dyin' in yer arms. So we swallowed it, in order t' begin our arduous journey towards salvation.
11404 : A long an' uncertain road lies ahead, t' be sure, but with the aid o' brave souls such as ye, we'll get t' our destination yet.
11405 : Ye be curious about who I meant by the lil' mistress? Sorry, matey, but that information ain't mine t' sharrre. Arrrg.
11406 : No need t' fret, though, 'cause I've got a feelin' ye'll get t' meet the lady soon enough.
11407 : Takin' another wild stab, might be ye're already acquainted with her in this worrrld, much like ye know me. Though this be simple speculation, mind ye.
11408 : T' spare ye the suspense, ye've passed with flyin' colors, matey.
11409 : Navigatin' Abyssea like it were yer own lil' pond, smitin' beasties that'd shame all the horrors o' the sea like they're no more'n guppies--takes uncommon courage an' a healthy dose o' foolhardiness.
11410 : Aye, ye be a regular swashbuckler, I reckon.
11411 : There be one among us come from the old Federation, an eccentric but likeable fellow. His field o' interest be the boundary between worlds, which he claims is gettin' t' be about as stable as an ol' sea dog w' two peg legs, an' it don't get much more unstable 'n that, matey. Ye ever heard o' such a thing?
11412 : Multiple dimensions exist in a single world, ye see, places similar yet different. Knowin' this, the notion that there be things the eye can't see becomes easier t' swallow, aye? Kinda like takin' a nice, long swig from me tankarrrd t' wash down the foul herbal remedy fer me heartburn. But that be a tale fer another day.
11413 : Gettin' back on topic, the boundary be growin' unstable, ever since the dimensions synchronized...or so I be told. Can ye imagine such a phenomenon? Are ye still even followin' what I'm sayin'? 'Cause, blimey, even I ain't sure I follow meself sometimes.
11414 : I don't claim full understandin' o' all this, but it don't take no atma infusionist t' see there be a problem. Aye, even a boorish pirate such as meself can tell when all hell's brrroken loose.
11415 : What's any o' this got t' do with yer suitability, ye ask? Why, everything, matey! Our world's been fair turned into a disaster zone, an' we need mettlesome folk who won't get all squeamish when confrontin' the mess. And by me measurin' stick, ye surpass that requirement by a nautical malm.
11416 : Keep in mind, though, that it's all over if ye die. Ye've got just the one life, so careful what ye do with it. These words must seem hollow, comin' from the selfsame bastarrrd who's askin' ye t' dive headlong into danger. But we've already lost enough things we care fer. The gods be damned if we lose any more.
11417 : Arrrg, but I ramble. I fear me mind's become much given t' wanderlust in old age. Resistin' the urge t' go off on a tangent or state the bleedin' obvious be about as hard as resistin' the call o' drink. Ye'll have t' bear with me.
11418 : Durin' me piratin' days, I saw many a thing n' more. Arrrg, there be nothin' left in the world that could surprise this sea dog, I'd often boast.
11419 : But then the earth crumbled an' the skies turned a bloody red, leavin' this brrraggart as dumbstruck an' clueless as a bleedin' lan'lubber gawpin' o'er an anchor hitch.
11420 : So fer all me yappin', I've really got nothin' useful t' share with ye. At least not fer the time bein'. The lil' mistress, however, she be a veritable treasure trove o' knowledge, aye.
11421 : Why do I know so little, ye ask? Why, that be a question o' readiness t' face the truth o' things, matey. Fer me, it seems the time's yet t' come.
11422 : Earlier, I told ye o' me involvement with the resistance. But truth be told, it's all this retired pirate can do t' keep himself an' those around him alive. All o' us have things we're bound t' prrrotect, after all.
11423 : It shames me t' no end, havin' t' rely on the kindness o' selfless folk like yerself...but there be no help fer it.
11424 : Fact is, yer aid will be o' far greater worth t' the lil' mistress than what me folk an' I could ever muster up.
11425 : But don't be presumin' that we mean t' sit idly by, scratchin' our bum cheeks. Yer courageous exploits have instilled much needed morale within the survivors, an' they stand rrready t' fight again.
11426 : The real battle starts from here, an' mankind ain't goin' down without a struggle, this I promise ye. Whatever bloodlust drives those vile creatures, we'll match it an' more with our will t' live.
11427 : Shiver me timbers, would ye look at the time? I must be headin' back before I'm missed. Be a good [lad/lass] an' pass me regards t' Joachim, would ye?
11428 : I look forward t' our next meetin', %. I promise t' cork up me rrramblin' then. Arrrg.
11429 : Ahoy there, matey. Hope I didn't make ye wait overlong.
11430 : Truth be told, I didn't imagine we'd need t' meet again so soon.
11431 : I bring grim news, %. Urgent tidings that wants fer tellin'.
11432 : After regainin' contact with the survivorrrs, we got them conductin' thorough investigations in their respective locales.
11433 : With yer keen eyes, ye've no doubt already noticed the disfigured Abyssean landscape. At first we all assumed the earthquake t' be the culprit, the one that shook the earth that fateful day.
11434 : But as we just discovered, that be not the case. The root o' the problem runs far deeper than all imaginin'.
11435 : I didn't mention it at our last meetin', but once I had the pleasure o' workin' with a bunch fondly referred t' as the Champions o' Abyssea.
11436 : A good-hearted lot they were, always tirelessly scurrin' about, gettin' things done behind the scenes.
11437 : Once, I asked them what be their drrrivin' force. An' how do ye imagine they responded? With naught but a mischievous grin! Hah! A right mysterious bunch they were, as many an' unique as the fishes in the sea.
11438 : So...uh...not ringin' any bells? Well, small wonder, what with me penchant fer incoherent bletherin'. Let me put it in a way right-minded folk'll understand: in yer world Vana'diel, the Champions o' Abyssea be ye adventurers. Aye, ye included, matey.
11439 : Durin' yer time in Abyssea, ye've surely met folk who also exist in yer world. However, ye've yet t' meet yerself. Have ye ever given thought t' why that is?
11440 : The answer be remarrrkably simple. Ye don't exist in that world no more. The reason be not known t' me, I'm afeared. One day, we simply lost contact with ye.
11441 : Any one o' a thousand things could've happened t' cause yer disappearance, matey. An' the possibilities be multiplied when I be in me cups, arrrg.
11442 : But no use dwellin' on it right now. It's high time we be gettin' back t' the topic o' the investigation.
11443 : One change o' particular note was reported: there be places where the land's breakin' down in a lattice pattern.
11444 : This phenomenon be happenin' throughout the realm, matey, on a level so subtle it'd escape the notice o' untrrrained eyes.
11445 : The skies turnin' a bloody red... Endless swarms o' beasties crawlin' out o' dark crevasses... The world's undergone changes never b'fore seen by mankind.
11446 : Yet...I can't help but feel that these be piddlin' lil' things compared t' what's on the horizon.
11447 : Mere droplets from the keg that's about t' be upturned over our heads. The wind b'fore the squall. A ramblin', disjointed preamble b'fore the--
11448 : Ahem! Well, I think ye get the point. So, this trepidation be eatin' away at me insides, matey, an' I can't stand it no more.
11449 : I've rrresolved t' seek the answers from the lil' mistress--ask her all she knows about what's befallen our world, an' what horrors are still t' come.
11450 : Whether I be ready t' deal with the truth, I can't say.
11451 : But the fate o' the world won't wait on the readiness o' one man. Fer better or fer worse, I must go an' do this thing.
11452 : Arrrg, looks like me cursed mouth found a will o' its own once again. I sure as hell hope I haven't put ye off future meetings between us, matey.
11453 : Fer now, fare ye well.
11454 : You are too far away to participate in the Voidwatch operation.
11455 : You are currently engaged elsewhere and cannot participate in the Voidwatch operation.

11457 : You do not fulfill the requirements to participate in the Voidwatch operation.
11458 : % gains clearance to participate in the Voidwatch operation. One % expended.
11459 : % gains clearance to participate in the Voidwatch operation. % not expended. (Spoils will be subject to limits.)
11460 : % gains clearance to participate in the Voidwatch operation. Unused % carried over.
11461 : You have ventured too far from the field of battle. You will be automatically relieved of Voidwatcher status if you do not return.
11462 : You have ventured too far from the field of battle. Voidwatcher status revoked.

11464 : You have # [minute/minutes] (Earth time) to complete the battle.
11465 : You have # [minute/minutes] (Earth time) remaining to complete the battle.
11466 : You have only # [second/seconds] (Earth time) remaining.
11467 : Your time for this battle is up...
11468 : The monster fades before your eyes, a look of disappointment on its face.
11469 : Temporary item: % is available for use!
11470 : All temporary items are recharged!
11471 : You feel a mysterious energy seeping forth from an unknown source...
11472 : The % resonates with the %. You may commence the Voidwatch operation at will.
11473 : A Voidwatch operation could be initiated if only you had % and %...
11474 : However, your presence does not seem to elicit a reaction.
11475 : What will you do? Nothing. Initiate Voidwatch operation. View alignment values. Examine atmacite. Read up on the Voidwatch.
11476 : Use %? Yes. No.
11477 : You do not possess the % necessary to initiate a Voidwatch operation here.
11478 : A fiend materializes from the planar rift!
11479 : Current Spectral Alignment Blue: +#% (reward quantity) Red: +#% (reward quality)
11480 : Yellow: +#% (experience yield) Green: +#% (cruor yield)
11481 : Alignment bonuses granted by ascent items will be added to the final value.
11482 : You can infuse up to # atmacite at this time.
11483 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (Lv.#) Infused: % (Lv.#) Infused: % (Lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.
11484 : Infuse which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) % (Lv.#) Previous page. Next page.
11485 : The % (Lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
11486 : Infusing the % (Lv.#) requires # cruor.
11487 : Infuse % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
11488 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
11489 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with % (Lv.#)!

11491 : Purge % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
11492 : % purges the % (Lv.#), infusing % (Lv.#) in its place. (Cruor expended: #)
11493 : Purge % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
11494 : % has been purged of the % (Lv.#).
11495 : You do not have enough cruor.
11496 : The atmacite could not be infused...
11497 : The atmacite could not be purged...
11498 : You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.
11499 : Enrich which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # % (Lv.#): # Previous page. Next page.
11500 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
11501 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
11502 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
11503 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
11504 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
11505 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11506 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11507 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11508 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11509 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11510 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11511 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11512 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11513 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11514 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11515 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11516 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11517 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11518 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11519 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11520 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11521 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11522 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11523 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11524 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11525 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11526 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11527 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11528 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11529 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11530 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11531 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11532 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11533 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11534 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11535 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11536 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11537 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11538 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11539 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11540 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11541 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11542 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11543 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11544 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11545 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11546 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
11547 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%
11548 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%
11549 : [Blue/Red/Yellow/Green] spectral alignment cannot be further raised with %. Current value: +#%
11550 : The % increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment to its maximum value.
11551 : The % increase [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment to its maximum value.
11552 : %'s Treasure Hunter skill increases alignment by #% across the spectrum!
11553 : Yellow: #% (+#%) Green: #% (+#%)
11554 : White: #%
11555 : Final Spectral Alignment Blue: #% (+#%) Red: #% (+#%)
11556 : You are not eligible for spoils.
11557 : You have obtained all spoils.
11558 : % obtains # cruor. (Total: #)
11559 : Obtain this item?
11560 : Obtain the %? Yes. No.

12382 : Am I still dreaming? Or can it really be...?
12383 : Lately, I've seen the strangest visions...
12384 : As I waited for you here, this crystal--it spoke to me...and I fell into a trance.
12385 : It was but another vision.
12386 : People fled to the four corners of Vana'diel, futilely trying to escape an ever-growing cloud of darkness.
12387 : And there I stood, frozen, my legs unable to do so much as quiver.
12388 : The mothercrystal's vision can't be simple happenstance.
12389 : Not everyone is aware that our world--our Vana'diel--is protected by the benevolence of the mothercrystal.
12390 : Look all around you. This place is no accident.
12391 : The technologies required to make these structures are beyond any known to us.
12392 : Those who came before doubtlessly created this facility to shelter the crystal from harm.
12393 : But I wonder...
12394 : There's some reason why the same visions continue to float before my eyes.
12395 : So I came here, to the mothercrystal.
12396 : Our world has remained resilient thanks to mothercrystals' blessings.
12397 : But what if it is our turn to protect her?
12398 : In my dream, an infernal gloom obscured the mothercrystal from view.
12399 : This mothercrystal isn't the only one, of course, and I've no way of knowing if I'm even at the right one...
12400 : Wait--does that mean you've seen the same vision?
12401 : ...I see. Then this Iroha came from a future where much the same thing has happened.
12402 : Then the beastmen that ravage the three nations are not to blame. So... So what is this Emptiness?
12403 : She might be the only one with the answers I seek.
12404 : Where could we run into her again?
12405 : Giving up isn't in my vocabulary, yet we've no choice but to hold off for now.
12406 : In the meantime, I'd like you to go to the place I saw in my dream. I'd go myself, but....
12407 : In the meantime, I'd like you to go to the place I saw in my dream.
12408 : How about it? I'll go. I can't right now. Uh...go where, exactly?
12409 : If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours...but I can't force you.
12410 : Thank you. I'm pretty sure the place I saw was somewhere near Jeuno.
12411 : I'm pretty sure the place I saw was somewhere near Jeuno.
12412 : Where did the vision take place? Lower Jeuno. Delkfutt's Tower. Qufim Island.
12413 : Do you think? I'm not so sure...
12414 : That's it! It's so clear to me now!
12415 : I wish I could go with you, but know that I'm there in spirit.
12416 : It doesn't take a soothsayer to know that darkness bodes ill. Stay safe.
12417 : I'll be there, %.
12418 : Master! Look--Lady Lion!
12419 : Master!
12420 : Lion? Lion!?
12421 : I...saw it again...
12422 : %, that special orb you have is a relic from the future.
12423 : Maybe that explains the visions I've been having.
12424 : If what it portends is true, then there is nothing we can do to stop the darkness from approaching.
12425 : But %, I saw nothing about whether or not you were there to try to stop it.
12426 : What if there is no one to stand up for Vana'diel? Will it perish with but a whimper?
12427 : Lion, perhaps it is because the orb is not yet fully illuminated.
12428 : I agree. Yet we learned about the coming darkness before the light could fully arrive...likely ushering it in before we were ready.
12429 : I know not what the two of you are on about, so I will ask one simple question: what can we do?
12430 : %, another image that floated before my eyes was one of you vanquishing the Shadow Lord.
12431 : The Shadow Lord!?
12432 : And the crystal spoke to you when you did.
12433 : Then it all falls into place.
12434 : You must stand steadfast against the lord of the beastmen in order to set history upon its proper course.
12435 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats--not just this one--and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12436 : Master, you must take your first steps along that path.
12437 : ...Stop the Shadow Lord.
12438 : %, there are many paths that lie before you.
12439 : They opened up the moment you banished the Shadow Lord from our realm.
12440 : My dream showed me many nations, many worlds...and you were there in each one, bringing succor to those who cried out.
12441 : Then it all falls into place.
12442 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats--not just that one--and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12443 : Master, you must bring history back to its natural state.
12444 : ...And time is not exactly on our side...
12445 : %, your journeys have taken you to the far corners of our realm.
12446 : The reckoning is at hand, quicker than any of us could have prepared for.
12447 : Then it all falls into place.
12448 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12449 : And [his/her] legend has already been forged.
12450 : Then we may be out of time...
12451 : And now you know everything that I do.
12452 : I'll be with you every step of your journey to conquer the Shadow Lord.
12453 : I'll do everything in my power to help you.
12454 : What the...
12455 : Lady Lion, allow me to express my gratitude.
12456 : Your honesty and strength of spirit has taken physical form.
12457 : And...you can use it?
12458 : Then you're quite welcome.
12459 : In the meantime, I'll continue my search for information about the Shadow Lord.
12460 : In the meantime, I'll continue my search for information about Escha.
12461 : Zeid, what do you plan on doing?
12462 : Gilgamesh has asked me to report back as soon as I know something, so my first order of business is to return to Norg.
12463 : Lion and Zeid, your assistance has been invaluable.
12464 : Master, I intend to learn all I can about that bell.
12465 : I await good news about the Shadow Lord's defeat.
12466 : Perhaps you should head back to Norg as well.
12467 : Until then.
12468 : The resonance between the % and the crystal reaches a crescendo!
12469 : The celestial capital of Al'Taieu welcomes you.
12470 : Would that it would do so with open arms, but the vortex slowly eats away at my home.
12471 : The capital is not the only thing to succumb. I, too, feel my energy beginning to fade.
12472 : You are eminently aware that I am not supposed to be present in this haven.
12473 : The void is compressing time, and things that once remained separate are starting to collide.
12474 : Perhaps it might be easiest to think of me as a wandering spirit.
12475 : No, you needn't offer me any explanation.
12476 : I have already heard that Siren's benevolence has guided you here.
12477 : You and Iroha have sought guidance from companions all throughout Vana'diel in order to stop the encroaching darkness.
12478 : In Iroha's future was an event called the Reckoning in which you made a decision that rang throughout the land.
12479 : As a result, Iroha was left alone, confined to Reisenjima.
12480 : A future in which Iroha was the only child of Altana left in Vana'diel.
12481 : And so you wish to beseech Altana herself for guidance...for any hint on how this bleak future can be altered.
12482 : Al'Taieu is oft referred to as the celestial capital because it has a stronger connection with Altana than anywhere on the ground below.
12483 : And I am able to commune with the terrestrial avatars and pass through the veil separating this world from the next via the crystal. Yet even I do not possess the means to reach Altana herself.
12484 : Even the most powerful forces in the lands, forces that can create whole worlds, cannot approach her.
12485 : Not even Odin.
12486 : No, such a feat requires more than anyone could hope to muster.
12487 : A power so great it could make the five crystals whole once more.
12488 : Yet did the future Siren not mention that a key may yet lie in Reisenjima?
12489 : I find no cause to doubt her, particularly in light of what I have discovered.
12490 : What if we could create a crystal that could banish the Emptiness?
12491 : %, you have traversed the cavernous maws, so I need not remind you that you have visited worlds other than our own.
12492 : These worlds exist in parallel, and each has its own past, present, and future.
12493 : Tartarus, a place known by a select few in Eastern Ulbuka, is one such world.
12494 : Countless years have I spent ensuring balance between these worlds, that they never interfere with each other.
12495 : From each I have drawn but a small fraction of crystal energy...
12496 : ...And have accumulated enough light to create another towering mothercrystal for Vana'diel.
12497 : Inquire about what? Drawing crystal energy. Accumulating light.
12498 : It is precisely as I have said. I have undertaken this plan since long before Iroha arrived here in this era.
12499 : This plan is to create a new crystal in Reisenjima, the holy land of the Far East, and create a safe haven from the darkness. A plan, I add, that requires an inordinate amount of time to bring to fruition.
12500 : Iroha's presence or absence makes no difference.
12501 : The result would be the same.
12502 : %, if what I said overlaps with anything Siren told you, then you may have just found another piece of the puzzle.
12503 : But what this Reckoning that Iroha speaks of is, I know not.
12504 : ...
12505 : You are the Warrior of the Crystal...and are destined to become the Warrior of Light.
12506 : You will coalesce thousands of points of light into a single shining star, your radiance casting out the darkness.
12507 : And you will become more than a mere Warrior.
12508 : Master, all the grand adventures you have embarked on led you here.
12509 : You have guided us all to the final struggle against an unthinkable future.
12510 : Vanquish the darkness that lies within you!
12511 : You have already banished the darkness that lies within you, and have but to fill yourself with sacred light.
12512 : Even in the most trying of times, there is one virtue that humanity does not abandon: hope.
12513 : It is your calling to keep that hope alive.
12514 : Iroha is the only one who can aid you in making your final decision.
12515 : And there is one more thing.
12516 : I would have you aid me should you feel that my plan is the proper course of action.
12517 : All I have worked to collect these many years is slowly being absorbed into the world known as Tartarus.
12518 : One born of that land has caught wind of my plan and seeks to undermine it.
12519 : Seek out the one whose dominion over magic is absolute...
12520 : Please...I beg you...
12521 : Ah, Master. Excellent timing.
12522 : Come! To the world of the gods!
12523 : Meet...Altana...
12524 : Teleport to where? Al'Taieu. The Empyreal Paradox. Nowhere.
12525 : Teleport to where? Al'Taieu. Reisenjima. Nowhere.
12526 : You must be %? Yes, you are not the only one who Altana's voice reached.
12527 : We meet yet again, %. Yes, you are not the only one whose voice Altana reached.
12528 : Perhaps the only reason you were able to hear Her is because you were once a [god/goddess] yourself...but even that will fade with time.
12529 : And as for me... Never before have I heard a voice so clear and beautiful.
12530 : Ah, this must be one of Vana'diel's many avatars.
12531 : Lord Tenzen, this avatar goes by the name of Carbuncle.
12532 : A fitting name for so lustrous a creature.
12533 : Tenzen? That's right--Iroha's father.
12534 : We meet again, my friend.
12535 : Ah, so Iroha's father makes his grand entrance.
12536 : ...?
12537 : And her mother as well. The two of you must be proud to have such a magnificent daughter.
12538 : Wh-what?
12539 : Y-you're sorely mistaken. What you imply is wholly out of the question.
12540 : Be that as it may, one thing remains clear: Iroha has not yet fully revived.
12541 : And so I am here to show you the way.
12542 : Close your eyes and wait for everyone to come...
12543 : I, Alexander, shall answer Altana's call, no matter where She bids me go.
12544 : Never let it be said that Odin shirked his responsibilities to the Goddess.
12545 : Savor this moment, %, for it will not happen again in your lifetime.
12546 : Whether it be this world or the true one, I have a responsibility to Vana'diel.
12547 : %, partake of my light.
12548 : ...And my darkness.
12549 : The burning flames answer the Goddess's call.
12550 : The embracing ice hears Altana, and answers.
12551 : The crackling thunder shall not shun the Goddess.
12552 : The earthen hands do not abandon Vana'diel.
12553 : The biting winds remain ever waiting for Her to beckon.
12554 : The crashing waves will see the Goddess's will carried out.
12555 : And I, too, never once left Her side.
12556 : Mine eyes remain ever fixed upon Her heavenly plane.
12557 : Your sacrifices in giving up a portion of your power will be returned tenfold.
12558 : And all we have, Phoenix, we give unto you!
12559 : %, though the path be laden with thorns, know that you are never alone.
12560 : Take what we have given, and return to the crystal in the Far East.
12561 : Your orb will doubtless lead you to Iroha.
12562 : There remains little time to free her from the Cloud of Darkness's clutches.
12563 : The cloud has taken control of her!?
12564 : Just like with the mask!?
12565 : Not exactly. But I fear she is suffering tremendously.
12566 : %'s orb and your blade are the keys to freeing her.
12567 : Return here should you have need of our powers again. We shall remain until the way has been cleared.
12568 : H-hold! The nonsense about Iroha's mother and father has not yet been settled!
12569 : Although...we can worry about that later. %, we have a task to see through!
