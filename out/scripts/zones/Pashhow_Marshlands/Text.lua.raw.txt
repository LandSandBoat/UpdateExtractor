6863 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6864 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6865 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6866 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.

6868 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6869 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6870 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6871 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6872 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6873 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6874 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6875 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6876 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6877 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6878 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6879 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6880 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6881 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6882 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6883 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6884 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6885 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6886 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6887 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6888 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6889 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6890 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6891 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6892 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6893 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6894 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6895 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6896 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6897 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6898 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6899 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6900 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6901 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6902 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...

6936 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
6937 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.

6952 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6953 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
6954 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
6955 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
6956 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
6957 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6958 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
6959 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
6960 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
6961 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!

6963 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6964 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
6965 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
6966 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
6967 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6968 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6969 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6970 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6971 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6972 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.

7562 : Are you still using the %? If not, I ask that you return it. There are many novice adventurers that could use one, and we are in short supply.

7687 : What do you wish to know about? Basic rules. About the Petra. About Sprint. About Scout. About Gate Breach. About area-specific rules. About returning to battle. About special rules. Nothing at the moment.
7688 : Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word ballista means to throw a stone, and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.
7689 : The rules are simple. Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.
7690 : Players from both teams must search for Petras that a Herald has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as Rooks.
7691 : These Rooks can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their Petras into them.
7692 : Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.
7693 : Petras can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the Quarry (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.
7694 : Sometimes a player may find items other than Petras, such as potions. These temporary items can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).
7695 : Players can carry more than one Petra, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them. However, players will lose their Petras if they: (1) Successfully throw them into a rook. (2) Leave the area. (3) Are knocked out.
7696 : But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the Sprint command while in possession of a Petra. And, players can only use the Scout command if they carry one of the stones.
7697 : As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.
7698 : All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the Sprint command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain Petras.
7699 : However, remember that once a player has obtained a Petra, he or she will be unable to use the Sprint command. In its place, though, one may use the Scout command.
7700 : The locations of the Rooks are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.
7701 : Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate Rooks. However, another way is by using the Scout command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest Rook.
7702 : Finally, Scout can only be used when a player is carrying a Petra. Because Sprint cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.
7703 : So, a Petra has been obtained and a Rook located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.
7704 : There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.
7705 : To throw a Petra into a Rook, a player must first wait until the Rook's gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.
7706 : But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve Gate Breach status. Only then will his or her shots count.
7707 : This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.
7708 : Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.
7709 : The following match types are area-specific: All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains
7710 : Best of Three series rules are as follows: Winning a match will earn a nation one match point. The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for come-from-behind victories.
7711 : Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.
7712 : Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.
7713 : When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.
7714 : For more information on temporary items, refer to the special rules.
7715 : After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.
7716 : If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.
7717 : Please note that many of the rules previously considered special have been fully implemented. Also, several new special rules have been added.
7718 : Learn about which special rules? Temporary items. Ballista Points. Scoring restrictions. Gate Breach radius expansion. Resistance to Sleep. Open entries. Minimum level restrictions. Re-entry restrictions. Participant & Rook numbers. Experience Points. Return.
7719 : Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as temporary items for use at any time during the match.
7720 : Players can hold up to ten temporary items, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.
7721 : If players who possess ten temporary items find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.
7722 : Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.
7723 : Finally, the Heralds will collect temporary items when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.
7724 : Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is #.
7725 : While it is taken into consideration, scoring Petras is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.
7726 : Ballista Points can be traded for special vouchers, which may be exchanged for free temporary items at the start of new matches.
7727 : However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match. Speak with a Marshal directly after a match to register your points.
7728 : Players will only be allowed to score up to five Petras at a time. Also, a player's Gate Breach status will be automatically disengaged if a Petra is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.
7729 : All allies within a certain radius will achieve Gate Breach status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.
7730 : Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.
7731 : During the entry period, from #:, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.
7732 : In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced: Level 30 matches: 130
7733 : Level 40 matches: 3140 Level 50 matches: 4150 Level 60 matches: 5160 Unrestricted matches: 61
7734 : Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.
7735 : When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.
7736 : Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.
7737 : Read which chapter on B.P. Ranking? Basic Information. Registering Points. Rewards. Chevron & Title List. None.
7738 : Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.
7739 : Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register [his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.
7740 : After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.
7741 : If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, [he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special chevron as well as a new title.
7742 : There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as twenty different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty jobs.
7743 : Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, [he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.
7744 : Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.
7745 : However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.
7746 : Finally, checking someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.
7747 : View which chevron/title? 1st (overall). 2nd (overall). 3rd (overall). 4th-10th (overall). 1st (warrior). 1st (monk). 1st (white mage). 1st (black mage). 1st (red mage). 1st (thief). 1st (paladin). 1st (dark knight). 1st (beastmaster). 1st (bard). 1st (ranger). 1st (samurai). 1st (ninja). 1st (dragoon). 1st (summoner). 1st (blue mage). 1st (corsair). 1st (puppetmaster). 1st (dancer). 1st (scholar). 1st (geomancer). 1st (rune fencer).

7815 : Nothing happens...
7816 : You can feel the warm, moist breath of the maw on your skin.

7818 : A portal has opened within the depths of the maw.
7819 : Raise your %? Yes. No.

7833 : Your body cannot cope with further strain. You must rest for another # [minute/minutes].
7834 : To where will you head? [The past/The present]. Walk of Echoes. Nowhere for now.
7835 : I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...
7836 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
7837 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
7838 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7839 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7840 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7841 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7842 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7843 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7844 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7845 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7846 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7847 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7848 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7849 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7850 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7851 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7852 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7853 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7854 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7855 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7856 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7857 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7858 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7859 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7860 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7861 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
7862 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
7863 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
7864 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.
7865 : A mysterious power absorbs the malice!
7866 : Please select absorption value. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
7885 : So, how's it going? Still haven't got your twenty, huh.
7886 : I haven't got that many either. Let's go back in there! I can't lose to Ayame!
7887 : Good. You have all done well. We seem to be only missing Naji...
7888 : Damn him, why is he always like this!?
7889 : Hey, guys! Wait till you hear what I did!
7890 : You are late! You almost compromised our retreat! Everyone was worried you might be injured!
7891 : I'm sorry, it's been a while since I got to bash on real enemies, so I couldn't just leave without getting some extra--
7892 : This mission's over! You may each go back to Bastok at your own leisure. I will report our success to the captain. Dismissed.
7893 : W-wait, you're not angry at me, are you?
7894 : It may not seem so, but those two truly are great warriors.
7895 : They are both the youngest people to become Mythril Musketeers ever. It almost seemed like this mission was a tedious chore to them.
7896 : It seemed to me that this mission's objective was to test us adventurers, in order to select the best of us for a greater task...
7897 : You see a message engraved on the stone:
7898 : These marshlands belong to a savage race of beastmen called the Quadav. Many have ventured in these lands seeking fame and fortune, but were never seen again.
7899 : But I have vowed to make a complete map of Vana'diel--the guilt I would feel for leaving these marshlands blank far outweighed the danger of entering them.
7900 : During my survey, I made the mistake of building a fire and was promptly captured by the Quadav. In their village, I was dumbstruck to see that their buildings were made of wrought metal!
7901 : As much as we use the Tarutaru magic of fire to light our smoking-pipes, the Quadav--a barbarous tribe by any account--had secretly harnessed much of Bastok's metalworking technology.
7902 : When I told them of my quest, they were most eager to help, releasing me and even going so far as to give me a guided tour of their home!   --Gwynham Ironheart, 763 Crystal Era.
7903 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
7904 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7905 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7906 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7914 : Harvesting is possible here if you have %.
7915 : Probability of loss = #/10000.
7916 : Your % breaks!
7917 : You successfully harvest %!
7918 : You harvest %, but your % breaks.
7919 : You are unable to harvest anything.
7920 : You cannot carry any more items. Your inventory is full.
7921 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7922 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7923 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7924 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7925 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7926 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7927 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7928 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7929 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7930 : You've earned conquest points!
7931 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7932 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7933 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7934 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7935 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7936 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7937 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7938 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7939 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7940 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7941 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7942 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7943 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7944 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7945 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7946 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7947 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7948 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7949 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7950 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7951 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7952 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7953 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7954 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7955 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7956 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7957 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7958 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7959 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7960 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7961 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7962 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7963 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7964 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7965 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7966 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7967 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.
7968 : Which E.F. would you like to join? . . . . . . The Zulkheim Region (Lv.20). The Norvallen Region (Lv.25). . The Derfland Region (Lv.25). . The Kolshushu Region (Lv.20).

7969 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
7970 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
7971 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
7972 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
7973 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
7974 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.

7979 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
7980 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
7981 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.

7984 : During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
7985 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
7986 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.

8006 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
8007 : I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
8008 : I can teleport you to your home country for # gil or # conquest [point/points].

8011 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.

8016 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points greatly. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
8017 : I could not accept one or more items you tried to trade me. Please remove those items and try again.
8018 : Sorry. I can only take certain types of weapons, shields, or armor.
8019 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points [by a small amount/moderately/greatly]. For this transaction I will also furnish you with # gil.
8020 : My apologies, but this type of item needs to be individually appraised. Please trade them to me one at a time.
8021 : (DEBUG) Back to hometown!
8022 : What do you want? Would you cast Signet on me? I'd like to set my home point here. Nothing.
8023 : What do you want? Pay # gil and set my home point here. Nothing.
8024 : Your home point has been set.
8025 : You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.
8026 : I will set your home point here.
8027 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
8028 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
8029 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
8030 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
8031 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
8032 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
8033 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
8034 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
8035 : There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
8036 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.
8037 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
8038 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
8039 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
8040 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
8041 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
8042 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
8043 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...
8044 : Cancel your participation in the E.F. to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?
8045 : Quit the E.F.? Yes. Change locations. No.
8046 : Are you sure?
8047 : Really quit the E.F.? Yes. No.
8048 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
8049 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
8050 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
8051 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
8052 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
8053 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
8054 : You received # conquest points!
8055 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
8056 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
8057 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
8058 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
8059 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
8060 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
8061 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
8062 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
8063 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
8064 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
8065 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
8066 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
8067 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
8068 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
8069 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
8070 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
8071 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
8261 : PAUSE
8263 : (Hippity-hoppity-hop!) Happy New Year, from me and my bouncy-wouncy little companion here!
8264 : (Hippity-hoppity-hop!) Happy New Year, from me and my bouncy-wouncy little companion here!
8265 : (Hippity, hippity! Hop, hop, hippity!) He says, You'll be posi-wositively bouncing off the wall with joy this year!
8266 : (Hippity-hippity hop! Hop!) He says, This year will be hop-wopping with happiness for you!
8267 : (Hippity hoppity!) He says, You'll have a springy-wing in your step from time to time.
8268 : (Hippity hop!) He says, You'll bouncy-wounce along at the same pace as last year.
8269 : (Hop...hoppity?) He says, Don't get your hopes hoppy-wopping too high.
8270 : (Hop...) Er, ah... There's always next year, so promise me you won't go jump-wumping off any bridges, okay?
8271 : The [orange/1/2/3/red/red/blue/blue/yellow/yellow/green/green/indigo/indigo/violet/violet] light... I can feel its power run through me.
8272 : Come, %.  Follow me...
8273 : Carbuncle vanished off in the direction of the La Theine Plateau.
8274 : Carbuncle vanished off to another area in the La Theine Plateau.
8275 : The % jumps in your hands.
8276 : Ahahahahaha! I can sense the power of the ring! Get yourself moving [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
8277 : Ahahahahaha! Don't slow down now, slacker! The readings are coming from the [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
8278 : Ahahahahaha! You're getting close now! I can feel the ring's power from the next area!
8279 : Ahahahahaha! You're almost on top of it! It's somewhere in this area!
8280 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
8281 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
8282 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
8283 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
8284 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
8285 : Now, listen close...
8286 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
8287 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
8288 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
8289 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
8290 : .........listen......
8291 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
8292 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
8293 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. The Four Musketeers(pt.1). The Four Musketeers(pt.2). A Chocobo's Tale(pt.1). A Chocobo's Tale(pt.2). Monstrosity.
8297 : Hm? What is this? %? How do I know this is not some [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] trick?
8298 : Step back, adventurer! I've got much more important things to worry about now!
8299 : What!? A surprise attack by the beastmen!? And today, of all days...
8300 : In a matter of hours, a handful of new squires will be joining our ranks here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8301 : These young patricians are quite spirited, but they lack valuable battle experience.
8302 : While we need be cautious not to disgrace their family names, we cannot let them fall in battle. We request your assistance in protecting the future of San d'Oria!
8303 : It will not be long before a caravan of traders in search of new trade routes arrives here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8304 : If they were to be injured by the enemy, the economy of San d'Oria could fall into chaos. We request your assistance in protecting the prosperity of our kingdom!
8305 : A group of Temple Knights is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe our daily work.
8306 : Ah, but perhaps this could be a perfect chance to show those pampered sissies that being a true knight comprises more than just chasing about shoplifters and sweeping the chateau gardens. However, no matter how much of a grudge we may hold, we cannot let our Elvaan brothers and sisters fall in battle. Understood?
8307 : In a matter of moments, members of the Royal Guards will be arriving here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare us for our next campaign against the beastmen.
8308 : If the fiends are conniving a surprise attack, I expect you to do your best in assuring that no disgrace will be brought upon the guards' names, as well as preventing any unnecessary bloodshed.
8309 : Today, our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] is blessed with the honor of welcoming an ambassador from the fine Republic of Bastok.
8310 : If anything were to happen to our guest, it could transpire into war between our two nations. I expect you to protect the attach with your very life!
8311 : In a few moments, a new batch of legionary recruits will be enlisted to the Republican Army and dispatched here to the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8312 : However, within their ranks are future scientists and craftsmen. Their deaths would be a great loss for the future of our nation.
8313 : We must ensure their safety, but we also must be careful not to prevent them from fulfilling their duties. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8314 : In a matter of minutes, a group of mariners will be arriving at our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] for self-defense training.
8315 : We must provide them with battle experience, but we also must ensure their safety. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8316 : My sources indicate that a party of Gold Musketeers carrying supplies is approaching the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8317 : These soldiers are the best of the best, and more than likely will not require any assistance in the event of an attack. However, if anything were to happen to them...
8318 : Later today, a group of high-ranking officials from Strategic Command will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare for Bastok's next campaign against the beastmen.
8319 : If anything were to happen to the commanders, you and I would both be court-martialed! The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8320 : I have just received word that a group of ambassadors from the Federation of Windurst is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe what measures Bastok has undertaken to maintain stability in the regions under Republican control.
8321 : If the attachs were to be injured on this occasion, the damage suffered to our nations' relationship would be irreparable. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8322 : Shortly, we will be conducting a test for our mercenary candidates here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8323 : This exam is to help us judge the candidates' skill in battle and help us separate those with talent from those who are bound for deskwork.
8324 : But after an attack by the beastmen...there won't be any candidates left to grade! You've got to help us give these kids a fighting chance!
8325 : It won't be long before a party of Federation scholars will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to do research on the local wildlife.
8326 : These scientists are more powerful with their pens than their swords...but that won't help them against a beastman attack! You've got to help us protect them!
8327 : Hmmm... Later today, a small group of Wize Wizards will be arriving to observe our daily work here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8328 : I say that we give them something to remember! %! It's up to you to prove to those bigwigs that we are the ones who maintain the peace in the Federation! Give those beastmen all you've got! (Just don't let the Wize Wizards get hurt...)
8329 : Today, a party of Federation Patriarchs is scheduled to arrive at the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to plan for Windurst's next campaign against the beastmen.
8330 : If anything were to happen to them, we'd all be reassigned to latrine duty! If you know what's good for you, you won't let anyone lay a finger on them!
8331 : Oh, why did the military attachs from San d'Oria have to come to our outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] now?
8332 : I shudder to think what would happen if an ambassador was injured...or worse! Get out there and protect those Elvaan with your life!
8333 : Excellent work! Your efforts helped protect the future of our nation. Divide this among your companions.
8334 : Our nation suffered an enormous loss today. We must begin reinforcing our defenses immediately!
8335 : Your inability to complete the mission has led to our defeat. The last thing our nation needs is an incompetent adventurer!
8336 : You fought hard, and you proved yourself worthy. You are a great asset to the nation.
8337 : We commend you on your services in helping us avert the beastmen's attack. I do not see them attacking us again any time soon.
8338 : This area is currently conducting a Ballista match. I have no time to trouble myself with your beastman trinkets.
8339 : A party member has an NPC called up. You cannot take part in this event.
8340 : I was thinking this out loud when an Elvaan girl passing by stopped to talk to me.
8341 : But what about moogles? They've got wings, and they can fly, but you wouldn't call 'em birds. They've got those funny antennae, too, but they're not insects, either.
8342 : When I responded to her remark with the fact that both moogles and chocobos are animals, this is what she asked:
8343 : Then what's the difference between animals and people?
8344 : I answered, People are smarter than animals. And then she retorted, People sure are more sly!
8345 : Ahahaha, don't get all huffy on me! I stopped to talk because what you were saying was important.
8346 : People are all different from one another. They're different from animals, and different from plants. This difference is what makes it all worth it.
8347 : There are lots of ways to think and feel, and things to know and to believe. But in the end, we all come from the same source.
8348 : That's true for both people and animals.
8349 : We all have this thing called a soul. The souls of animals are pure and simple.
8350 : Look over there. That chocobo is living proof.
8351 : You should ask someone how that chocobo was born. Then you'll have your answers.
8352 : ...And then she went on her way.
8353 : I went to find out how that chocobo was born, but no one could tell me.
8354 : Shalott said the chocobo's mother was from the stables in Bastok.
8355 : She said it was a special chocobo that had silver-colored feathers on its neck.
8356 : How I wish I could go to Bastok to see her for myself.
8357 : I wonder if that Elvaan girl will be passing by again anytime soon...
8358 : That Elvaan girl told me that both people and animals have souls. She said that the souls of animals are far more pure than those of people.
8359 : She also told me I would understand what she meant if I found out how that chocobo was born.
8360 : According to Shalott, the chocobo's mother is from the stables in Bastok. How I wish I could go there to see her for myself...
8361 : What can I do for you? If you want to ride a chocobo, one of the girls over there can help you out.
8362 : Lately, a lot of adventurers seem to be forgetting that a chocobo is an animal, not an object.
8363 : You should keep that in mind as you're enjoying that easy ride through monster-ridden badlands. Have a safe journey.
8364 : A chocobo with silver-colored feathers...?
8365 : Ah, you'd be talking about Silver Comet.
8366 : She used to be the mount of a highly ranked general in the Bastokan navy.
8367 : The general's son received the chocobo as a coming-of-age present, which he promptly took advantage of to leave Bastok.
8368 : For the longest time, no one saw hide nor hair of man or beast--until eventually, Silver Comet came wandering back into town...alone.
8369 : I heard later on that the general's son had lost his life somewhere in the wilds.
8370 : Only Silver Comet had managed to return unharmed.
8371 : In memory of his son, the general asked us to take the chocobo into our care...
8372 : But then one day, Silver Comet was gone. Some chocobo thief had stolen her.
8373 : Hm? You say a chick of Silver Comet's is being kept in the Jeuno stables? You must be mistaken.
8374 : Anyway, after the theft, the general exhausted every avenue in search of his son's chocobo.
8375 : He eventually found an adventurer who allegedly saw a chocobo drowning in the Pashhow Marshlands.
8376 : That chocobo had the same markings as Silver Comet.
8377 : If you want to try talking to that adventurer, you should go to the outpost in the marshlands.
8378 : He's given up the adventuring life, it seems. Now he earns his daily bread by seeing to the needs of the soldiers at the outpost.
8379 : The gate is locked.
8380 : Whaddaya want? I got no time for adventurers.
8381 : Huh? Where'd you hear... Well, whatever.
8382 : You say you got business with me?
8383 : Silver Comet... What the hell are you bothering me about that old chocobo story for? You some kind of crackpot?
8384 : Leave me alone, you loon.
8385 : Can't you see I'm busy?  This place gets too wet and too dark too quick to be wasting time chatting.
8386 : Hold up a minute. If you bring me some %, I might be willing to give you the time of day.
8387 : Yep, three of those ought to do it. I'll give you until the day after tomorrow.
8388 : You brought what I asked for? Careful with that stuff, it's powerful smelly.
8389 : It's good for hiding a person's scent, you see. Helps me get around.
8390 : Now, then. You wanted to hear about that chocobo, right?
8391 : She was one of the fastest chocobos I've ever ridden, but damn near uncontrollable. I don't know how Silver Comet's owner handled her.
8392 : I guess the death of her former owner is what sent her off the edge. That chocobo wasn't right in the head.
8393 : She threw herself headlong into the marshes. Thought my number was up, I can tell you!
8394 : When I saw her in the stables, she was wearing a collar attached to a chain.
8395 : That wasn't to keep the general's mount from being stolen--it was to keep Silver Comet from flying the coop, so to speak.
8396 : That general's a real schemer. Said that if Silver Comet was released, she would be able to find Shooting Star.
8397 : It's his fault I almost got killed!
8398 : Huh? Who's Shooting Star? He's a chocobo, too.
8399 : Shooting Star was Silver Comet's mate.
8400 : Their love was a pure, uncomplicated thing, much more so than what people feel.
8401 : Ahahaha! I think this oil is starting to muddle my senses. I'll see you around, adventurer.
8402 : Were you able to meet with that adventurer?
8403 : ...Is that right? I think you were around that % a bit too long.
8404 : It sounds to me like that adventurer was the one who stole Silver Comet in the first place.
8405 : Or at least you would think so, if the thief wasn't supposed to have drowned in the marsh as well.
8406 : You mentioned a Shooting Star? I know that name.
8407 : That chocobo was raised alongside Silver Comet. Those two were almost inseparable as chicks.
8408 : Unfortunately, unlike Silver Comet's case, Shooting Star died saving his master.
8409 : I'm guessing Silver Comet was trying to find him when she jumped into that marsh. The general mentioned something similar at the time, I recall.
8410 : Hm? Still trying to convince me that her chick is in Jeuno?
8411 : I'm sorry, but I really think you're mistaken. I mean, the general even had Silver Comet's collar.
8412 : He said he was going to lay it on his son's grave in Batallia Downs.
8413 : But, wait. I seem to remember that collar being sent by a man named Brutus. He runs a chocobo stable in Jeuno...
8414 : Why would the collar be sent from Jeuno when Silver Comet drowned in the Pashhow Marshlands?
8415 : You are being attacked!
8416 : Now is not the time for that!
8417 : You sense something is not quite right...
8418 : You find nothing.
8419 : I...I don't know what you're talking about.
8420 : Wow... So this collar belonged to that chocobo's mother, Silver Comet?
8421 : I would place this on the grave of her mate, Shooting Star, if I only knew where it was.
8422 : So you're the two snoopers who were asking Shalott about Silver Comet.
8423 : That collar...!?
8424 : You've dug pretty far into this old story. Looks like after twenty years, people start to let things slip.
8425 : Please don't be angry, Brutus.
8426 : I found out that chocobos can fall in love, just like people do.
8427 : There was a girl who taught me that animals and people are the same.
8428 : I think the story of Silver Comet and Shooting Star helped me to really understand what she meant.
8429 : Well then, I suppose I'll have to tell you the whole tale.
8430 : Silver Comet and Shooting Star never really died.
8431 : Really!?
8432 : Shooting Star was a special chocobo that was attacked by an evil man.
8433 : He was badly wounded when they brought him here, and we all worked hard to get him back on his feet.
8434 : But Shooting Star was still being chased by the evil man, so we had to hide him away.
8435 : We took him to a place in the west of Batallia Downs, where that villain would never find him.
8436 : But the bad man was clever. He knew that if he had Silver Comet, her bond to Shooting Star would lead them right to the chocobo's hiding place.
8437 : Silver Comet was one smart chocobo, though.
8438 : She deliberately dove into the marshes to force the villain from her back.
8439 : It was an extremely dangerous thing for Silver Comet to do.
8440 : But she never gave up. She had to protect her mate from the man who meant to hurt him.
8441 : Silver Comet swam through the muck and dragged herself free of the marshlands. She was finally able to make it to Shooting Star's side.
8442 : That's when I took off her collar and set her free.
8443 : What happened to them after that?
8444 : Did they live happily ever after?
8445 : That's right. And the youngest of the brood they raised together is that chocobo right over there.
8446 : What a great story...
8447 : It's not over yet. The villain of this tale is still lurking around somewhere.
8448 : That's why you can never tell anybody what you've heard here today.  You want to keep that chocobo safe, right?
8449 : Right!
8450 : I'll never tell, I promise!
8451 : Glad to hear it. And one more thing...
8452 : Don't forget how Silver Comet never gave up on her mate.
8453 : Even when those they love and believe in have gone, animals will keep on striving.
8454 : Right. That's because animals come from the same source as people.
8455 : Adventurer, you can have this. Keep this story to yourself.
8456 : Thank you so much! And this is from me.
8457 : I wonder if that Elvaan girl knows how Silver Comet and Shooting Star were married.
8458 : I would like to meet her again some day...

8604 : Lookin' for cards in all the wrong places.
8605 : This chocobo riding is a lot more painful than it looks. I think I'm starting to chafe.

8636 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
8637 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
8638 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
8639 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
8640 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
8641 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
8642 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
8643 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
8644 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
8645 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
8646 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
8647 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
8648 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8649 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
8650 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8651 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
8652 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
8653 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
8654 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
8655 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
8656 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
8657 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
8658 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!

11765 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11766 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
11767 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
11768 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
11769 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
11770 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
11771 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
11772 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
11773 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
11774 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
11775 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
11776 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
11777 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
11778 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
11779 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
11780 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
11781 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
11782 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
11783 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
11784 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
11785 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
11786 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.

11803 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
11804 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
11806 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
11807 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...

11812 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
11813 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
11814 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
11815 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
11816 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

11915 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11916 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11917 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11918 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11919 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11920 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11921 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11922 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11923 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11924 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11925 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11926 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11927 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11928 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11929 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11930 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11931 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11932 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11933 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11934 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11935 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11936 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11937 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11938 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11939 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11940 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11941 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11942 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11943 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11944 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11945 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11946 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11947 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11948 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11949 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11950 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11951 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11952 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11953 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11954 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11955 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.

12745 : Hist! Thou canst see the light, canst thou not? It seems thou hast the talent for which I have been searching.
12746 : Thy lack of experience, however, leaveth a single teary trail upon my cheek. Mayhap with more training, thou can attainest further glory.
12747 : Eke, thy training hath not been in vain. My only question is that, with thy great powers, dost thou not tire of this corporeal realm?
12748 : How do I know of thy deepest desires? 'Tis only natural, for the soul doth constantly yearn for greener pastures.
12749 : Yet the pasture it hath been given is finite. Each soul's lot is to one day meet with its fence. Such wanion!
12750 : Yet what if there were a method by which it could escape its confines and begin life anew?
12751 : Shouldst thou be enchanted with these adumbrations, procurest for one of my brethren %, %, or %.
12752 : They reside in Northern San d'Oria, Port Bastok, and Port Windurst. To which thou yede is of no matter, as their message shall be the same.
12753 : Whether or not thou undertakest this effortless swink to free thyself from thy shackles is a choice which is wholly thine to make.
12754 : Slip that % upon thy finger and let thyself bathe in its luminescent emanations.
12755 : Vague images of worlds beyond coalesce and diffuse within.
12756 : Enter the light? Take me now! Absolutely not!
12757 : Enter the light? Take me now! I'll dive in head first! Absolutely not!
12758 : Nothing happens...
12759 : Quotha...the light that shines forth from thy soul hath brightened a considerable degree.
12760 : Natheless, it remaineth but a dull glow akin to twitherym dust whenas compared to the blindingly refulgent souls of more accomplished combatants.
12761 : To fulfil thy true potential, thou needs assume the role of gladiator and bathe in monipulator blood.
12762 : As a monipulator, thou hast likely reduced opponents everywhere to bawling babes at the mere mention of thy name.
12763 : Simultaneously, though, combatants who hath cut swaths through adversaries while inside bestial vessels betimes yearneth for more...to bite the hand that feedeth.
12764 : A saga sung of those who instill terror and those who release the land from it... Bwahaha, a worthy tale of spiritual strife, forsooth.
12765 : Now that the stage hath been set, I shall impart the extent of my gladiatorial knowledge to thee. Simply ask and thou shalt receive.
12766 : What shall you ask about? Belligerency. Ranks. Prestige. Spoils. Domination. Nothing.
12767 : Those who have the ambition to slay monipulators can do battle against them by speaking with [me/my Northern San d'Orian ally] or one of my brethren in either [Port Bastok or Port Windurst/Northern San d'Oria or Port Windurst/Northern San d'Oria or Port Bastok] and receiving %.
12768 : This % is thy metaphorical muster as well as official avowal to enter belligerency.
12769 : While it doth provide myriad boons to thee, it preventeth not those outside thy coterie from interfering with thy duty. Such a benediction will only descend upon the yare souls who hath claimed monipulators as their prey.
12770 : I must also caution thee to beware that, depending on thy level of expertise, it may not behoove thee to tread upon the soils of certain lands.
12771 : Lastly, should thy bloodlust cease or resolve wither on the vine, speak to me and I shall grant thee permission to withdraw from belligerency.
12772 : Lastly, should thy bloodlust cease or resolve wither on the vine, speak to one of my compatriots and they shall grant thee permission to withdraw from belligerency.
12773 : Three ranks doth serve to classify the world's monipulator executioners. There is the eponymous gladiator (Gla), champion gladiator (CG), and high champion gladiator (HCG).
12774 : Naught else needs be explained anent this simple concept...save that a gladiator's rank is determined by his prestige.
12775 : Prestige is the gladiator's equivalent of the common adventurer's fame.
12776 : Defeating both monsters and monipulators increaseth thy prestige, while falling victim to their claws decreaseth it.
12777 : Each rank also hath a corresponding maximum amount of prestige, much like the infamy of monipulators.
12778 : Ascertaining thy current prestige is merely a trifle. (Access the Profile menu under Status.)
12779 : Of course, prestige is not simply a means by which to boast to thy inferiors. Thou canst cede it to me in exchange for troves of splendid rewards.
12780 : No victory doth taste as sweet as one where the stakes are high. Flaying treacherous notorious monsters and high notorious monsters occasionally earns thee spoils of war.
12781 : A little cockatrice told me that monipulators even relinquish equipment betimes, so hold not back from slicing, stabbing, and spellcasting thy savage enemies to smithereens.
12782 : Eke, the equipment thou dost obtain may be engraved with arcane glyptics.
12783 : Eke, the equipment thou dost obtain may be engraved with arcane glyptics by my consorts.
12784 : Athwart terrestrial beings such as thee, our mezzotinting process leaveth nary a scratch on extant arcane glyptics.
12785 : In sooth, it would be pure idiocy to charge nothing for our services. However, I shan't discuss figures at this juncture.
12786 : Forget not that we must have % in order to engrave arcane glyptics, lest thou wish to incur the wrath of my people.
12787 : Thy soul pineth for more than thou canst conceive. Set it free and embark upon gladiatorial exploits the likes of which Vana'diel hath never witnessed.
12788 : Aroint, thou malmsey-nosed fustilarian!
12789 : What shall you do? Receive %. Return %. Participate in PT Content. Exchange prestige. Hear an explanation. Engage in friendly banter. Nothing.
12790 : Possessing % enableth thee to enter combat with monipulators. Dost thou assent?
12791 : Give your assent? Yes. No.
12792 : Thou tardy-gaited poltroon! Dost thou soothly desire to return thy % and withdraw?
12793 : Return and withdraw? Yes. No.
12794 : Bear in mind that transferring thy soul to the frames of other creatures hath its limits. Occasionally stretch thy sinews as a gladiator to both round thy world view and reach higher heights.
12795 : What is it thou desirest?
12796 : Which reward? (Prestige: #) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) %. (# needed) None.
12797 : Thou art willing to part with # point[/s] of prestige to obtain this %, nay?
12798 : Proceed with the exchange? (Prestige: #) Yes. No.
12799 : Quotha, the least thou canst do is provide the requisite amount of prestige... Where are thy manners?
12800 : Assuming the form of a monster for too many moons doth exert an unwanted influence upon thy anima. Take pleasure in thy time spent within multiple forms, but not so much that thou canst never return to thy original vessel.
12801 : Though monipulators and gladiators art diametrically opposed, thou mayest shift alliance betwixt both sides of the conflict as thy humors see fit. There cannot be good without evil, and the sides shall for all eternity be in stasis.
12802 : Good and evil, monipulator and adventurer...they are but two sides of the same coin.
12803 : Oh, how I yearn to assume the form of a monster in the same manner as thee. Wellaway, I must be content with mine empty husk of a vessel.
12804 : I suppose that I too a monipulator hight. Natheless, that fact doth not give thee permission to assail my frame with thy blows.
12805 : One could conceivably clepe me a monipulator as well, sith I too possess hosts.
12806 : This % hath yet to be mezzotinted.
12807 : Drastic changes are in store for this %, methinks.
12808 : This % hath reached the pinnacle of enhancement. I can do naught but stare in amazement at thy progress.
12809 : In return for # point[/s] of prestige from thee, I shall [enhance the arcane glyptics extant on/engrave arcane glyptics upon] this %.
12810 : This %'s [original/post-augmentation/post-enhancement] attributes are thus:
12811 : This % doth be in good...tails?
12812 : This % hath been enhanced with arcane glyptics already.
12813 : This % hath reached its limits and cannot be further enhanced, but may still evolve into newer forms.
12814 : This % hath reached its limits and cannot evolve further.
12815 : What do you wish to do? Evolve the item. Mezzotint. Nothing.
12816 : Which type of glyptics shall you engrave?
12817 : Which type do you want engraved? Arcane Glyptic Type A. Arcane Glyptic Type B. Arcane Glyptic Type C. None.
12818 : Do you wish to mezzotint your weapon so that it is primed to receive the aforementioned attribute enhancements?
12819 : Do you wish to mezzotint your weapon again so that it is primed to receive these attribute enhancements?
12820 : Your % has successfully undergone mezzotinting.
12821 : How do you feel about these attributes? I heartily enjoy them. I despise them and want new ones.
12822 : In return for # point[/s] of prestige from thee, I shall mezzotint this %.
12823 : Into which weapon shalt thou evolve this specimen?
12824 : Which one? None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12825 : Shall this be the one?
12826 : How do you feel about this weapon? I thoroughly enjoy it. I loathe it and want a new one.
