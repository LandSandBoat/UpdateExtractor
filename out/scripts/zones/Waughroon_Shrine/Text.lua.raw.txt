6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7603 : Heh-heh-heh... I'm so glad you could come. I didn't realize that little rumor I spread would be so effective.
7604 : Yes, I'm the new leader of the beastmen! I will lead the beastman hordes on a grand campaign to rid the world of you and your kind!
7605 : The day of reckoning will come, and the beastmen will be the ones to rule this world! Ah, but you won't be there to see it...
7606 : Because you will already be dead!
7607 : Arise, Wyrm of Darkness, Devourer of Light! I command you--smite my enemies where they stand!
7608 : First, the beastmen and now this...quite a mission this is turning out to be.
7609 : But there is only one way to end it!
7610 : This...this cannot be! Me, defeated...by these weaklings!?
7611 : Oops, I guess I missed the show.
7612 : Hey, wait a minute. This dragon...
7613 : No doubt about it, it's a nether beast from the Northlands! What's it doing here!?
7614 : Their kind haven't been seen ever since the Shadow Lord was destroyed and the Northlands sealed...
7615 : To see one here, with the beastmen, it's as if...
7616 : The Shadow Lord will soon be brought back to this world. I was merely making preparations for His return...
7617 : What!? Who are you!?
7618 : I am Seeker, a servant of the Shadow Lord. The Great Hero that saved you twenty years ago is gone--none have the power to defeat Him now.
7619 : While your people were busy squabbling with each other, we have been preparing for His return.
7620 : And when He comes...He will destroy you all!
7621 : Enjoy your lives...while they last... Foolish...weaklings... Hah hah...hah...
7622 : The Shadow Lord...is coming back... There's going to be another war...
7623 : Our days will be filled with hatred and sorrow once more...
7624 : And I call myself a Musketeer... That I would let myself be hit like that...
7625 : Thank you for helping me. I am Ayame, of the Mythril Musketeers. I would be dead were it not for you...
7626 : We'd received reports of strange beastman activity in this area, so I was sent here to investigate. I didn't expect to run into...that.
7627 : I must go back and report. We'll meet again, adventurer. May you travel safely.
7628 : Hellllllp!
7629 : You thought you heard a call for help.
7630 : Thank you so much! You're pretty strong... Wait, have we met somewhere before?
7631 : Oh well, thanks anyway for your help. I came to this Quadav shrine deep in the mine because I thought there would be some treasure. But I ended up getting caught instead! Go figure!
7632 : So, why are you here? What? You were looking for me? Is this about...the letter?
7633 : Oh, I completely forgot. Here, I'll give this to you. I have a feeling that if I don't, I'll forget again.
7634 : Give my regards to the president for me. I met him once, but I don't deal well with people who are always on edge like that.
7635 : Thank you again for all your help!
7636 : I got no business with a flea like you. Get outta my face before I decide to messy-wess you up.
7637 : You're %, right? Ha ha ha! I knew it! Just like Gilgamesh described. Lemme tell you what I gotty-wot so far.
7638 : The creepy-weep that stole our helmet isn't from any large syndicate. He isn't even very famous among other pirates. He's just a simple thiefy-weef trying to pull off a big job for a big profit.
7639 : According to the owner of that inn, he traveled numerous timey-wimes between here and Selbina, and would sometimes talk about his plans after a few too many drinky-winks. But then one day, he just disappeared.
7640 : After looking at Norg's nautical loggy-wogs, I learned that the time he disappeared matches the time he must have entered our headquarters. But where he went from therey-where, I don't know.
7641 : Wa-wa-wait! There's something else.
7642 : One of our men in Bastok is piecing together all the information we've gathered so far. He's hiding out in a run-down old housey-wouse in the Mines District (J-6). He should be able to give you something juicy-wuicy.
7643 : I thought that this might have been the work of some large groupy-woop, but when I heard that it was just one guy...boy, was I surprisey-wised!
7644 : I can understand wanting to makey-wake it big overnight, but he should have thought a little bitty-wit longer before deciding to take us on!
7645 : Would you mind leaving me alone? I have no time for small talk.
7646 : You are %, are you not? I have been waiting for your arrival. I do not have much time, so I will keep this quick.
7647 : The day of the theft, there were numerous reports of a strange character wearing an even stranger helmet traveling on foot towards Zulkheim.
7648 : I journeyed here from San d'Oria, but heard nothing of such sightings on my way. This leaves the possibility that he may have turned back to Jeuno.
7649 : I feel that he may still be in the area. I am going to continue my search here.
7650 : And one other thing.
7651 : One more of us is stationed in a small, run-down building in the Bastok Mines (J-6). He may have some useful information.
7652 : The type of helmet that was stolen is known in the Far East as a kabuto. Many people find its design strange, but I find it quite interesting.
7653 : You're finally here, %.
7654 : I've heard of you from my associates in Norg. As much as I would like to sit and chat with you about your adventures, we must work quickly to find our thief. I have just received a new piece of information and will be setting out shortly to investigate.
7655 : To the northeast of here is a place called the Palborough Mines. I've received information on several adventurers sighting a young man wearing a strangely shaped helmet journeying deep into those caves.
7656 : This is more than likely the same character that Sanosuke learned of in Jeuno. But why would he head to the Palborough Mines? I'm heading there myself to find out.
7657 : I have heard that the Quadav made that place into one of their strongholds. I wonder if there could be some connection...
7658 : You may journey to the mines with me if you wish. When you have made your preparations, meet me there. I will be waiting.
7659 : I-it's you...
7660 : We're too...late. He's already...passed through the...portal. The seal...on the helmet...won't hold much...longer.
7661 : Unless you want to end up...like me, don't...touch the burning circle. It's protected...by a powerful curse.
7662 : Hurry...back to Norg and tell...them what's happened. Get something to...break the curse...keep the demon...from escaping...
7663 : .........
7664 : He has lost consciousness.
7665 : The time has come for me to rise again... I am no longer bound by the chains that annoying Hume forced upon me...
7666 : Many a night I wasted away, rotting in the darkness of my prison...
7667 : Gnyah-hah-hah! But Humes are a frail species. They grow old and wither away. The one who sent me to my hell is no more...
7668 : Now there are none who can stand in my way!
7669 : What is this? I sense someone approaching... Someone with the same power as that Hume...
7670 : You did it!
7671 : The seal was broken, but thanks to you, the demon has been put to rest.
7672 : Our ancestors' % has been damaged, but its tattered appearance is proof of the evil sprit's demise. Take this back to Norg and inform them of your deeds.
7673 : Much of the cursed seal still remains. I will remain here and attempt to clear the rest of it away. Until we meet again, %!
7674 : The % has been badly damaged... You obtain %.
7675 : The % you carry has lost its effectiveness. You may dispose of it now.
7676 : You've cleared Samurai AF 2!
7677 : You don't have %!
7678 : Press any button to continue (probably the confirmation one, though).

7688 : So, you decided to show up. Now it's time to see what you're really made of, heh heh heh.
7689 : Looks like you weren't ready for me, were you? Now go home, wash your face, and come back when you think you've got what it takes.
7690 : Hm. That was a mighty fine display of skill there, %. You've come a long way...
7691 : I'll teach you to respect your elders!
7692 : Take that, you whippersnapper!
7693 : Now that I'm warmed up...
7694 : Ungh... That'll hurt in the morning...
7695 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7696 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7697 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7698 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7699 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7700 : Now, listen close...
7701 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7702 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7703 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7704 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7705 : .........listen......
7706 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7707 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.

7718 : Heeeee-yah!!!
7719 : The % dematerializes before your eyes!
7720 : Phew... You're not such a pushover aftaru all. I almost broke a sweat.
7721 : You still haven't realized? The Atori-Tutori you defeated was merely a part of me. Specifically-wifically speaking, my shadow.
7722 : To splitaru it from my physical body, I borrowed the energy of your little %, you see.
7723 : No small task, I'll have you know! Whew... I might need a nap after this one.
7724 : But hey, you got your training, and I got my first decent workout in years. Everybody wins, rightaru?
7725 : That % acts as a catalyst of sorts to bring my shadow to the fore. Now you know, and knowing is half the battaru.
7726 : What's that? You want to fight me for real, you say?
7727 : Trust me, %. You're bettaru off quitting while you're ahead.
7728 : Of course, one never knows. Work your buttaru off for the next few centuries or so, and you just might have the faintest chance of maybe, possibly (if ever improbably) giving me a run for my gil.
7729 : ...But that's a challenge for another day. And with that, I'm off. Ta-taru!
7730 : And don't forget, %. Our contract is still in effect.
7731 : Promise you won't go down too easy, okay?
7732 : Haha! I'm just getting warmed up!
7733 : Hah! You pack more of a punch than I thoughtaru. But I won't go down as easy as old Maat!
7734 : What's this strange feeling...? It's not supposed to end...like...
7735 : Huh? Is that all? I haven't even broken a sweataru...
7736 : Yikey-wikeys! Get that thing away from meee!
7737 : <Pant, wheeze>... What's the mattaru, %? Too much of a pansy-wansy to fight fair?
7738 : The fantastic feast has begun! Stock your stomach with stupendous sweets, and enjoy it to the last!
7739 : The fantastic feast has finished! I hope you had a hopping-good time, and we want you to wamble your way to the next one!
