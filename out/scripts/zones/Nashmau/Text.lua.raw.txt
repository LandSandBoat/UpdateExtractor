6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

10722 : Nooo, yooo are no ghooost!
10723 : Pyopyoroon is sad. Pyopyo-pyorooon.
10724 : Hm? Maybe! Maybe yooo are ghooost hunter tooo?

10726 : Yooo go west of here! Many rooocks and stooones, yes! Yooo find plenty of ghooosts!
10727 : But there is special ghooost. Ghooost like %! Did yooo know?

10732 : Big, red, many-many wavy-wavy arm creature has %! Yooo go to Wajaom or Bhaflau!

10741 : Oh, the [man/lady] whooo toook Pyopyoroon's smell!
10742 : Hm? Special ghooost cry? Ghooost like Pyopyoroon's smell?
10743 : Nashmau...?
10744 : !!!
10745 : %!
10746 : Pyopyo-pyorooon!
10747 : It's the ghooost hunter!
10748 : Yooo jump from ghooost ship! Pyopyoroon not believing eyes!
10749 : Our efforts seem in vain. The Ashu Talif and her crew still haunts these seas...
10750 : That captain... The strange aura he conceals...
10751 : No, I am most likely thinking too much.
10752 : And I have yet to report to you the information I have discovered about that vessel.
10753 : If the rumors are true, the ship we boarded is known as the Black Coffin.
10754 : However, according to the history books, the Black Coffin was meant to have sunk almost two hundred years ago...
10755 : At the time, she was crewed by the rebels of Ephramad.
10756 : Also known as corsairs.
10757 : This word basically means pirate. But the corsairs were far more than simple brigands.
10758 : They were the heroes of a lost kingdom, clashing valiantly against the vast might of the Empire in a bid to reclaim their nation.
10759 : The admiral that led the corsairs into battle...
10760 : ...was Prince Luzaf.
10761 : A courageous warrior feared by his enemies...
10762 : Ah, it seems my feathers have dried...
10763 : These are not for plucking!
10764 : I shall return to my tale.
10765 : This port town of Nashmau, now home to these Qiqirn, was once a naval base built by the surviving citizens of Ephramad.
10766 : With Nashmau at their center, the Arrapago Islands were the last refuge remaining to the survivors of Ephramad...
10767 : And the last stronghold of Prince Luzaf...
10768 : He carried the torch of his people's hopes, and turned it into a blazing inferno for vengeance...
10769 : If the rumors are indeed accurate, then the man we encountered on that ship...
10770 : In any case, we are certain that the Ashu Talif is more than just a tavern rumor.
10771 : It may sound like another fairy tale, but I intend to report everything I have learned to President Naja.
10772 : If we tell her the same tale on different occasions, she may place more credence to the story.
10773 : Our mercenary assessment should benefit from this as well, do you not agree?
10774 : I leave immediately for Al Zahbi!
10775 : I advise you to do the same.
10776 : Farewell, %!
10777 : I'm , a soldier of the great Empire of Aht Urhgan. Pray tell, why have you come all the way to this forsaken land?
10778 : Don't waste my time, adventurer.
10779 : %! Excellent work. I will inform the commander immediately.
10780 : Your Imperial Standing has increased!
10781 : What is your business? I want to receive Sanction. I want to spend my credits. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
10782 : I will bestow upon you the Empire's Sanction. Good luck.
10783 : The Astral Candescence is now in Al Zahbi, so you will receive an experience bonus from battles. You can also select one of the following bonuses in exchange for a slight decrease in your Imperial Standing.
10784 : Choose a bonus for # [credit/credits]? Not now. Regen. Refresh. Increased meal duration.
10785 : You have received the Empire's Sanction.
10786 : You do not have enough Imperial Standing credits to receive the bonus.
10787 : You cannot receive the bonus. The Astral Candescence has been taken.
10788 : You currently possess # [Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits]. Would you like to use them to purchase items?
10789 : Which item do you wish to purchase? Common items (All ranks). 1000-pt. items (Private 2nd Class). 2000-pt. items (Private 1st Class). 4000-pt. items (Superior Private). 8000-pt. items (Lance Corporal). 16000-pt. items (Corporal). 24000-pt. items (Sergeant). 32000-pt. items (Sergeant Major). 40000-pt. items (Chief Sergeant). 48000-pt. items (Second Lieutenant). 56000-pt. items (First Lieutenant). Cancel.
10790 : There are currently no items available for that rank.
10791 : Your Imperial Standing is too low to purchase the %.
10792 : Are you sure you want to purchase the %?
10793 : You already possess %.
10794 : Which item do you wish to purchase? % (# credits). % (# credits). % (# credits). Return.
10795 : You do not meet the requirements to purchase the %.
10796 : Your rank is too low to purchase the %.
10797 : Your Imperial Standing is too low to purchase the %.
10798 : You cannot equip the %. Do you still wish to proceed?
10799 : Your level is too low to equip the %. Do you still wish to proceed?
10800 : You seem to be able to equip the %. Do you wish to proceed?
10801 : Are you sure you want to purchase the %?
10802 : Proceed? Yes, purchase item. Cancel purchase.
10803 : Proceed? Yes, even though I can't equip it. Cancel purchase.
10804 : Which item do you wish to purchase? %. %. %. Back.
10805 : Which item do you wish to purchase? %. %. %. %. Back.
10806 : Which item do you wish to purchase? %. %. %. %. %. Back.
10807 : Which item do you wish to purchase? % (# credits). % (# credits). % (# credits). % (# credits). % (# credits). % (# credits). % (# credits). % (# credits). % (# credits). Next page. Previous page. Back.
10808 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Sanction. Imperial Standing. Besieged.
10809 : What about Besieged? Never mind. Besieged basics. Serpent Generals. Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi. Astral Candescence with beastmen. Empire's current state of defense.
10810 : Sanction is a magic spell that we use to observe and assess mercenaries' actions.
10811 : Defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you will raise your Imperial Standing. Also, the stronger the monsters you fight, the higher your Imperial Standing will become.
10812 : When fighting in a beastman stronghold that has taken the Astral Candescence, your Imperial Standing will rise by a significant amount as thanks for your participation in the recovery effort.
10813 : Sanction is also necessary in order to receive crystals from the enemies you defeat.
10814 : But you must take caution. Stepping too far out of the Empire's boundaries will cause Sanction to wear off.
10815 : You can raise your Imperial Standing by defeating enemies while you have Sanction cast on you.
10816 : Saving a captured prisoner in a beastman stronghold and submitting archaic mirrors to Imperial guards will also result in an increased Imperial Standing.
10817 : You can view your Imperial Standing by selecting Besieged under Region Info.
10818 : You can also speak to me at any time to exchange your Imperial Standing credits for items.
10819 : Besieged occurs when the beastman armies breach the walls of Al Zahbi.
10820 : Everyone in town who is capable of wielding a weapon is called to action to defend Al Zahbi alongside the Imperial Army.
10821 : The beastmen's main purpose is to enter the Hall of Binding and wrest the Astral Candescence from the Empire's control.
10822 : You need not know what the Astral Candescence is.
10823 : All you must know is that it is your duty to protect the five Serpent Generals who hold the keys to the Hall of Binding, and to drive the beastman hordes from the Imperial capital.
10824 : The Empire's safety and its future rest on your capable shoulders! Rest assured that you will be rewarded for your efforts.
10825 : The Empire's defense is entrusted to five generals.
10826 : Each possesses a name corresponding to the symbols of the Empire--the serpents of flame, water, stone, gales, and sky.
10827 : Furthermore, the mirrors used to open the Hall of Binding are divided among their possession. Thus, the generals' fates determine the tide of battle.
10828 : If all five generals should fall in battle, the Hall of Binding will open, and the beastmen will be able to seize the Astral Candescence.
10829 : It is your responsibility to prevent such a disaster from happening. We are depending on you!
10830 : When the Astral Candescence is safely resting on its plinth in the Hall of Binding, it emanates waves that bestow special bonuses to Sanction.
10831 : The first bonus is a slight boost to the amount of experience points received from battles. You will receive this effect simply by having Sanction cast on you.
10832 : There are several other bonus effects, but you must sacrifice some of your Imperial Standing credits in order to receive them.
10833 : Keep in mind that the bonuses become more powerful with the number of times the Imperial capital is successfully defended.
10834 : Sanction's strength will reset if the beastmen succeed in invading the Hall of Binding, though.
10835 : The waves emanating from the Astral Candescence in Al Zahbi bring a multitude of blessings to all of us. You must not let it fall into the hands of the beastmen!
10836 : If the beastmen manage to take the Astral Candescence, its recovery will become our top priority. Find the coveted item on a plinth in one of the beastman strongholds and seize it back for the Empire!
10837 : We aren't quite sure what the beastmen are scheming to do with such power, but we do know that the Astral Candescence's waves can increase the beastmen's strength.
10838 : As if that weren't enough, we have recent reports that the beastmen have set archaic mirrors in their strongholds to magnify the power of the waves.
10839 : If you should come across any archaic mirrors, take them immediately and trade them to an Imperial guard.
10840 : Al Zahbi has been successively victorious in # [battle/battles] to defend the capital, bringing the Imperial defense to a value of #. The Imperial capital has seen # [victory/victories] overall, and the Astral Candescence has been seized by the beastmen a total of # [time/times].
10841 : You do not possess the # [Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits] required to fully recharge the %.
10842 : Please be aware that you can only recharge % once during the period between each Conquest tally.
10843 : The % is already fully charged.
10844 : Your % has received # [charge/charges] in exchange for # [Imperial Standing credit/Imperial Standing credits]. It is now fully recharged.
10845 : Yooo want to send gooods? Yooo want to send clink clink?
10846 : Yooo send gooods. Yooo send clink clink.
10847 : The Mamool Ja Savages are on the move. Intercept their forces in the Wajaom Woodlands!
10848 : The Troll Mercenaries are on the move. Intercept their forces in the Wajaom Woodlands!
10849 : The Undead Swarm is on the move. Intercept their forces in Bhaflau Thickets!
10850 : The Mamool Ja Savages have breached the Balrahn Defense Line! Intercept their forces in Al Zahbi's Bastion!
10851 : The Troll Mercenaries have breached the Balrahn Defense Line! Intercept their forces in Al Zahbi's Bastion!
10852 : The Undead Swarm has breached the Balrahn Defense Line! Intercept their forces in Al Zahbi's Bastion!
10853 : Al Zahbi is Besieged! Defend the Astral Candescence!
10854 : Al Zahbi is no longer Besieged.
10855 : The beastmen have retreated.
10856 : The Mamool Ja Savages have retreated.
10857 : The Troll Mercenaries have retreated.
10858 : The Undead Swarm has retreated.
10859 : Al Zahbi has recovered the Astral Candescence.
10860 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The beastmen have taken the Astral Candescence.
10861 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The Mamool Ja Savages have taken the Astral Candescence.
10862 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The Troll Mercenaries have taken the Astral Candescence.
10863 : The Hall of Binding has been breached! The Undead Swarm has taken the Astral Candescence.
10864 : This town's got to be the most boring place on Urhguum for a tourist.
10865 : You must be really curious to come all the way out to this forsaken place.
10866 : There's a puppetmaster here who's the same way. He should've realized that no matter how talented he might be, no one could interest the runts that live here.
10867 : What? You want to know more about the puppetmaster? You've got to pry your nose into everything, don't you?
10868 : He dropped his gil pouch in Caedarva Mire the other day, and he's been out looking for it for days since. You might catch him if you search outside.
10869 : You curious types are drawn to each other, aren't you? I guess I'm one of you, though.
10870 : You again? Are you still looking for that puppetmaster?
10871 : He's at the end of this path...
10872 : It looks like he's just returned.
10873 : Oh, hello... I remember you. Is there something you need?
10874 : Do you need anything? Ask about the automaton. Ask how to get around Nashmau. Shall we go out for tea?
10875 : Wh-what about it? It's just a regular automaton! Why would you think I have anything to say about it?
10876 : Sorry, but I'm a little busy... L-later!
10877 : You want to know how to get around this town? No problem, just let me show you around! I owe you for the other day, anyway.
10878 : So you want to see the port? Most everyone who comes to Nashmau comes in through that port...
10879 : Enough talk. Let's go. You've got nothing better to do, right?
10880 : This is the port. It's not much to see...huh?
10881 : What's this...?
10882 : Tea? I don't remember there being a teahouse here in Nashmau...
10883 : Is it new? It must have been built very quickly...
10884 : Well, I'd like to see this place for myself, too. Let's go!
10885 : It does look like there's something here after all...
10886 : Well, I'll be darned! Customers!
10887 : ...This place looks kind of suspicious... Are you sure it's safe?
10888 : You ready to order? I've got the best tea in Nashmau right here! I highly recommend it, all of it!
10889 : Your order? Chai. Coffee. I'll pass, thanks.
10890 : One cup of chai, comin' right up! Want one for your friend, too?
10891 : Um... I'll have coffee...
10892 : Aaack! No!
10893 : Ahhh!
10894 : Oh, sorry, sir. Um... We seem to be all outta beans at the moment, sir!
10895 : Oh...is that so? Okay then... I guess I'll have some tomato juice...
10896 : This is a teahouse! A teahouse, got it? Why the hell would you think we have Mithran tomatoes!?
10897 : A...teahouse...? Well, you should have said so earlier!
10898 : So it'll be two cups of chai then, right? Right!
10899 : One cup of coffee, comin' right up! You're in luck, too... We just got in a fresh shipment of high-quality beans! And what'll your friend be having?
10900 : I'll have the same.
10901 : Nonononono, you don't want the same thing. Trust me! Chai is our specialty! You've got to try it!
10902 : Um...but I like coffee better...
10903 : Oh, I'm sooo sorry, sir! We just ran clean out of beans! What a shame!
10904 : But didn't you just say a moment ago...
10905 : Sorry, but that's the way the cookie crumbles! Fine, I'll give this cup of chai to you on the house! Drink it up, now!
10906 : Your friend will be having something, though, right?
10907 : Nah, I'm fine.
10908 : What're you here for, then? Get outta here!
10909 : Well, I think that's enough, don't you? See you later!
10910 : Heh heh heh! Mix it up, don't be shy! Chai, chai, chai
10911 : Fiiirst we mix iiin...mi-- ...Okay, all ready!
10912 : Hey hey, first we what? What did you just do?
10913 : Secret recipe. Sorry, can't share that.
10914 : ...
10915 : Well, here you are! Take your sweet ti--huh?
10916 : (Which one was the thief's again?)
10917 : Is something the matter?
10918 : Nothing! Drink it up while it's still hot!
10919 : (%! Everything is riding on your luck now!)
10920 : The cup of chai on the right is giving off a suspicious vapor. The cup of chai on the left is giving off a suspicious odor.
10921 : The cup of chai on the right is giving off a suspicious odor. The cup of chai on the left is giving off a suspicious vapor.
10922 : Which one will it be? The right cup. The left cup.
10923 : Here goes nothing...
10924 : (...! Not good! I made the thief's cup first...which means...!)
10925 : Ouch, this is hot! It burned my tongue... How's yours?
10926 : (Perfect! There's still a chance! Switch the cups now!)
10927 : Hey...you must be really tired, eh?
10928 : Sorry, but when [he/she] wakes up, could you tell [him/her] that I had to leave?
10929 : Thank you.
10930 : Mmm... Chai tastes better than I remembered.
10931 : Ah, yes. I was going to thank you for defeating the monster in the mire for me the other day.
10932 : Haha. It's not like [he/she] did it for you. What were you doing there, %?
10933 : Now that you mention it...it isn't exactly the kind of place to go out for a walk...
10934 : And come to think of it...I don't usually have visitors, either. Why did you come to me today?
10935 : [He/She] wasn't coming to you... [He/She] was coming to me.
10936 : Isn't that right, Iruki-Waraki?
10937 : !!!
10938 : Wha--!? Argh!
10939 : Zzz...
10940 : So you saw through my disguise... I should have known you would.
10941 : I've missed you so much...Elisabeth!
10942 : Don't make me sick. And stop calling me Elisabeth. I hate that name.
10943 : ...
10944 : I've come to rescue you! Let's go back home together!
10945 : ...
10946 : I'd sooner lunch with a Lamia!
10947 : No!!!
10948 : She's so shy...
10949 : Cute, sweet little Ellie...
10950 : Let's hurry up and find Elisabeth before this thief wakes up!
10951 : Ungh...
10952 : What!? You can't be awake already!
10953 : Ah! It's you!
10954 : Iruki-Waraki! I've been dying to see you!
10955 : Huh?
10956 : I'm so, so sorry for stealing your automaton! Please...save me!
10957 : Um...?
10958 : I...I can't bear it any longer... The brutality! Please, take it back! I beg you!
10959 : I tried so many times to return it, but it always got her hands on me before I could do anything... It makes me shiver just thinking about it...the pain...
10960 : Uhhh...
10961 : Why'd you steal my automaton in the first place?
10962 : It's a long story...
10963 : It all started about half a year ago. I ran an armor shop in Al Zahbi. One day, the sky was pouring down rain and there was hardly anybody on the streets... Business was slow...
10964 : And then, a tiny Mithran child visited my shop and asked if I was selling any automatons.
10965 : Of course, being an armory, I didn't have a single automaton in stock. But she went all that way in the rain just to come to my shop... I felt terrible turning her away empty handed...
10966 : Then, after defeating the dragon... I ran back to the girl, eager to make her dream of becoming a puppetmaster come true.
10967 : I couldn't have known what tragedy awaited...
10968 : A terrible tragedy...
10969 : Geez, you weren't kidding when you said this was gonna be long.
10970 : Oh, come on. I'm a third of the way through already! Won't you let me continue?
10971 : I want to go look for my automaton. I think the place you were at was a fine ending to your story.
10972 : You will take that horrible thing back, won't you?
10973 : That's what I came here for! But now I don't know where she is...
10974 : If it's not on a ship, it must have gone to Caedarva Mire. I'll do anything I can to help you find it!
10975 : Thanks. It's your fault we're so far behind now, anyway. You and your pointless story...
10976 : Pointless!?
10977 : Hopefully % will tag along just a little longer, too.
10978 : All right, let's go!
10979 : Rats!
10980 : Well, we still did pretty well. Let's try again tomorrow!
10981 : Thanks for coming. The automaton should come looking for me here any time now.
10982 : (Ellie is coming here...)
10983 : Look at that crowd of Qiqirn.
10984 : Yeah, I see...
10985 : I called them here to watch an automaton performance.
10986 : A performance for...Qiqirn?
10987 : That's right. No matter how talented your automaton is, the Qiqirn aren't going to understand the point of its antics.
10988 : We'll charge in when it's starting to get desperate, and tell it that its abilities are still limited.
10989 : Then the automaton will realize how helpless it is without Iruki-Waraki, and it's sure to go back to him.
10990 : But I don't think I could entertain Qiqirn, either...
10991 : That doesn't matter. The point is merely to prove to the automaton the limit of its ability.
10992 : After it comes to its senses, you'll be there for it... It is certain to accept you then.
10993 : You think that all of that will go according to plan? What if she's not even interested in performing for Qiqirn?
10994 : Don't worry. The way it was bragging last time, there's no way it'll refuse.
10995 : (I hope this is the right way to go about bringing her back...)
10996 : It's here! There's no turning back now!
10997 : Where the hell were you? I'm gonna use you for kilicbaligi bait, you big oaf!
10998 : Iruki-Waraki? What are you doing here? Get it through your head... I'm not going back!
10999 : I...
11000 : We just wanted to watch you perform. We gathered everyone here together just for you.
11001 : What's that? You've gotta be out of your mind!
11002 : Well, you said yourself that everyone was looking forward to your performance. You said that you're fine on your own.
11003 : I called Iruki-Waraki here so he could see that for himself, and bring him some closure.
11004 : Whatever. You're really getting on my nerves. Can I hit you?
11005 : Whoa whoa, let's not be rash, now. There's already a crowd here, so isn't it the perfect chance to show us your skill?
11006 : There's no crowd! Just you and this runt!
11007 : Oh, you know that's not true. Just look around you.
11008 : You're not talking about these half-pints here, are you?
11009 : (Look who's talking...!)
11010 : Why, of course I am... Or are Qiqirn a problem for you?
11011 : Qiqirn, eh...
11012 : After all that talk about how everyone loves your performances, it turns out that you're picky with your audience, eh?
11013 : Ah, I get it now! You only perform for the easily entertained! It doesn't take much to please them, right? I see... So that's why!
11014 : Pardon me for asking you to perform! To think... I never imagined such a pathetic excuse...
11015 : I apologize for the misunderstanding!
11016 : You have a death wish, don't you?
11017 : Fine, let's play your game. I guess it wouldn't hurt to have a few Qiqirn fans.
11018 : Did you hear that, everyone? The automaton is going to start performing here for you now!
11019 : Don't think you'll get out of this without any scars to show for it...
11020 : I wonder if Ellie will be okay...
11021 : All right, you... Feast your eyes on this! Wait... Back up, you rodents! You're way too close!
11022 : Who yooo?
11023 : Body not soft? Haaard, yes?
11024 : No mouth? Where mouth? You speak how?
11025 : Aaargh! Get out of my way! You're supposed to sit still and watch like good little beastmen!
11026 : Aaahhh! Loook, loook! Tsotsoroon can do same noise! Oooahahaaa!
11027 : Where eyes? How yooo see?
11028 : It's starting to wear on her...
11029 : Ellie...
11030 : Don't touch me! Just what do you think you runts are doing?
11031 : Head loook like stew pot?
11032 : Anything in head?
11033 : This is hand? How yooo use?
11034 : It's no use... Just as I thought...
11035 : Yes, this is the limit of your talent. By yourself, you can do nothing... You're just a regular automaton with a big head.
11036 : No...
11037 : You're wrong...
11038 : Iruki!?
11039 : Ellie, you are...
11040 : Shut up.
11041 : Maybe I couldn't do anything. But I don't need your sympathy!
11042 : What can you do? Nothing would change if you were with me, because you're useless!
11043 : You're right... I might not have been able to do anything...
11044 : But Ellie, you're different. You're a magnificent automaton! There is nothing you can't do!
11045 : I've been watching you... I know better than anyone that your talents are boundless!
11046 : I am so proud of you. Watching you grow so fast gave me such joy and the strength to continue my work as a puppetmaster.
11047 : So I won't let anybody tell you that you're useless! I can attest to your brilliance!
11048 : Iruki...
11049 : So what?
11050 : !!
11051 : So you really are useless!
11052 : All the other puppetmasters are always busy doing fancy tricks with their animators, but what do you do? Nothing!
11053 : And you're supposed to be one of the top puppetmasters on Urhguum? Don't make me laugh!
11054 : Get out of my way. You got something to say, too?
11055 : What do you wanna tell me? Why Iruki is a great puppetmaster. A puppetmaster's greatest possession. Elisabeth's secret to success.
11056 : Well, if you've got something to tell me, then out with it already!
11057 : I will!
11058 : You've lost sight of what's important!
11059 : Iruki's been watching you all this time, but you haven't been watching him!
11060 : The performances you give and the words you speak... You got them all from Iruki-Waraki!
11061 : Everything you have now came from him! Your talents are actually his talents!
11062 : So how can you say he hasn't done anything? He raised you into the automaton you are today!
11063 : Anybody can tell a puppet to do tricks, but a good puppetmaster grows with his automaton!
11064 : The fact that he doesn't use the animator proves that he doesn't need to order you around! He trusts you!
11065 : Ellie... Let's try it again.
11066 : ...?
11067 : This time, let me help you. If we can entertain the Qiqirn together, please come back to me.
11068 : Please, Ellie...
11069 : Okay, fine. Whatever.
11070 : Listen up, Qiqirn! The automaton's performance is about to start!
11071 : Wow...that seemed to go by fast.
11072 : Still, you were great together! I never imagined seeing such a performance under these circumstances...
11073 : What did you think, %?
11074 : How was it? Highly entertaining. Your words were too kind. I liked the scene with the Mithra.
11075 : The Qiqirn loved it, too. Iruki-Waraki is the best puppetmaster in Al Zahbi...no, in all of the Aht Urhgan Empire!
11076 : You puppetmasters are pretty critical of each other, aren't you?
11077 : You look like a fantastic puppetmaster yourself, though. I look forward to seeing your performance, too!
11078 : Huh? I don't remember seeing any scene with a Mithra... What were you looking at the whole time, anyway?
11079 : Whew... I haven't been that nervous in ages.
11080 : Ellie...?
11081 : What? I-it's nothing! My gears are just a bit rusty...
11082 : I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not Master Shamarhaan, you know...
11083 : Er...ah...
11084 : Hm?
11085 : Um...eh...
11086 : Ellie...
11087 : Eh?
11088 : Let's go back to Al Zahbi.
11089 : ...Yeah.
11090 : Yes! Oh, yes! Finally free from that wicked creature! No more suffering in silence for me! Woo-hoo!
11091 : It's time to go home now.
11092 : Later.
11093 : Oh yeah... Next time you're in Al Zahbi, stop by and say hi, okay?
11094 : I'll be waiting!
11095 : What do you want? I'm busy. Save it for later!
11096 : You might as well give up, lady, 'cause you're not getting thrrrough here, no matter how hard you try.
11097 : I've come all the way from Al Zahbi, and I'm not going home empty-handed!
11098 : So get out of the way and let me look for my son!
11099 : How many times do I have to tell you no? The mire is teeming with vicious monsters!
11100 : You'd be mincemeat before you managed two steps out of the gate!
11101 : I don't care about monsters! Just let me through!
11102 : Maybe you don't care, but I do. I'm not going to sit by and let an old lady get attacked by monsters!
11103 : You might be safe here, but to the north there are fearsome beasts called Lamiae, who animate the corpses of their prey.
11104 : L-Lamiae, you say? ...And they can control corpses!?
11105 : That's rrright! And I don't want to see you turned into a monster, got it?
11106 : So stop begging me to let you out!
11107 : That...that...
11108 : ...Is all the more reason I need to go save my son, and pronto! Now move it!
11109 : Yooow! Hey adventurer, come on! Don't just stand there... Stop her!
11110 : Whew... Thanks for the help...
11111 : I thought she was going to pull my tail rrright off my body! I've never experrrienced such pain...
11112 : You haven't helped me any!
11113 : And my son...my sweet, precious little son might be in grave danger as we speak! My poor baby...
11114 : He needs me! He might be hungry right now, or crying alone out in the cold...
11115 : Ahgdeen! Oh, where are you, Ahgdeen!?
11116 : My poor, poor baby...!
11117 : (She came all the way here to find her runaway son...)
11118 : (But you know...with a crazy, violent mom like this, who can blame the kid?)
11119 : ...I heard that.
11120 : Yikes!
11121 : Aha! You're an adventurer from the West, aren't you?
11122 : You'd let this person outside, wouldn't you?
11123 : Um...well, I suppose I would. Better than having you out there, anyway...
11124 : Oh please, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer...please save my son! Please listen to a mother's desperate plea!
11125 : He's my only son, and the center of my life! Can you realize how strong a mother's feelings for her child are?
11126 : I will repay you! You have my word!
11127 : I know it's a rrreally selfish request...
11128 : But this old lady's wearing me out...
11129 : Sorry for the trrrouble, but do you think you could search for her son?
11130 : Search for her son? Not much choice, is there? What a pain...
11131 : After all you've heard, my son is still just a pain to you? You heartless beast!
11132 : Oh, thank you! Thank you!
11133 : You might want to know that someone saw a guy by the Deadmist Marsh that looked like he could be that woman's son.
11134 : But they said he went rrrunning off to the north out in the Mire. I wonder where he could be now.
11135 : Why didn't you mention this earlier!?
11136 : (If I had told her earlier, she would have bowled me over to get to her son!)
11137 : (With a woman of her size, that must feel like being stampeded by a herd of marids...)
11138 : (Sh-she's got sharp ears!)
11139 : In any case, I will be waiting here. Hurry up and find my son!
11140 : Please!
11141 : Well, this has turned into a fine mess, hasn't it? Take care on your journey, all rrright?
11142 : Someone saw the old woman's son heading to the north of the Deadmist Marsh. The sooner you find him, the better...
11143 : You're back! Did you find my son?
11144 : Mother...
11145 : Ahgdeen!!!
11146 : Foolish boy! There wasn't a day you weren't in my thoughts! Do you have any idea how worried I was?
11147 : Ah, a touching reunion at last...
11148 : Look at you! All skin and bones...poor thing, you must have had a rough time without Mama to help you!
11149 : Mom, th-that hurts...
11150 : You're safe now, and there's nothing to fear. I'll never let you out of my sight again!
11151 : Now let's hurry home! I'll make you all the piping-hot % you could ever want!
11152 : M-Mom... There's something...
11153 : I'm sure you were just a bit confused. That's why you left home. Even you get tired sometimes, don't you?
11154 : But from now on, you can just leave everything to your old mom here!
11155 : Mother!
11156 : I...I can't go back home with you.
11157 : Ahgdeen? What are you saying?
11158 : Let me introduce...my girlfriend.
11159 : A pleasure to make your acquaintance. My name is Basweema.
11160 : Yow! She's a babe!
11161 : Sorry, Mother, but I have decided to live here with Basweema.
11162 : I am going to marry her.
11163 : ...Is that so?
11164 : She's pulled the wool over your eyes, hasn't she?
11165 : What did you do to him, you vixen!? Give my son back to me!
11166 : Just how many men have you tripped up playing the coy maiden?
11167 : You might be able to fool my son, but you can't fool me!
11168 : Please...stop it! I would never...
11169 : What!?
11170 : How dare you take that tone with me, young woman! Don't you get catty with me!
11171 : L-let's not bring Mithra into this, now!
11172 : Mother, stop it! She hasn't done anything wrong!
11173 : And you...my very own son!
11174 : Don't even try to tell me you want to marry this woman... Why, anyone could see there's something fishy about her!
11175 : My feelings for your son are true! I am completely serious about our relationship!
11176 : I beg of you... Let us be together!
11177 : Whaaat this...?
11178 : Yooo smell...fishy! Yooo have Lamia smell!
11179 : Oooh? There Lamia here?
11180 : Oh yes, she smell like Laaamia. Not like Nashmooo peoples. Scary, scaaary! Maybe come to take us away!?
11181 : Run, run! Everyone run awaaay! She turn yooo to cooorpse and yooo control by Lamia!
11182 : Hohooo...Leleroon have fast legs. No catch Leleroon.
11183 : Lamia baaad! Lamia should die!
11184 : What are they talking about?
11185 : Something about a Lamia, but I can't make sense of it...
11186 : Ahhh! Her...her legs...
11187 : Eek! What's going on here!?
11188 : Ahgdeen...
11189 : I'm sorry!
11190 : She...can't be...
11191 : There's no doubt about it... That girl is a Lamia! I told you about them a few minutes ago, didn't I? They're the beasts that animate corpses!
11192 : I knew she was fishy, but I never imagined she was a monster! Oh, my heart...
11193 : But...Basweema...
11194 : Did you not see that snakelike tail, son!? If I hadn't come, she would probably have killed you!
11195 : They say that those charrrmed by the Lamiae willfully become living corpses to serve them...
11196 : I'm sorry, but she trrricked you. If this adventurer hadn't gone to find you, I'm afraid you would have met a different fate today.
11197 : I hope this has opened your eyes! She's not the only monster out there, you know. You've got to be careful when dealing with women!
11198 : Come on, let's get back to Al Zahbi now. The sooner, the better!
11199 : Basweema...
11200 : Just let me talk to her one last time! I can't believe she would trick me! She's not that kind of person...
11201 : She's not a person at all! Ahgdeen, when your mother says no, you better listen!
11202 : Listen to your mother! This time, she'll rrreally kill you!
11203 : Go after him! I don't want this to be the last I ever see my son! Please, don't let him out of your sight!
11204 : You've got to go after that woman's son, or he'll be killed!
11205 : Ah, there you are! The old woman and her son made it back safely and rrreturned to Al Zahbi together.
11206 : Ahgdeen looked prrretty down, but he seemed somehow...stronger than before. Or maybe I'm just imagining things.
11207 : In any case, it's a wonder he made it back in one piece after being trrricked by a Lamia. That's certainly cause for celebration!
11208 : Speaking of which, his mother told me to give this to you. I hope you find some use for it.
11209 : <Sigh>. This assignment'll be the end o' me. Maybe I can grab a short nap over here...
11210 : Hey! What're you lookin' at!? You try rattin' me out for dereliction o' duty an' I'll tear yer arms outta their sockets!
11211 : This assignment'll be the end o' me. Maybe I can unload it onto some other unsuspectin'...
11212 : Whaddya want? Hm? Now where have I seen...?
11213 : Hey, aren't you that mercenary who investigated the ghost ship?
11214 : I oughta pound yer head into the wall for bringin' this awful assignment down on an honest soldier's head!
11215 : Huh? You got no idea what I'm talking about? Great Walahra's whiskers...
11216 : You have the honor o' speaking to General Halshaob, awe-inspirin' commander o' the Maelstrom Company.
11217 : The army is still buzzin' about the Empress givin' an audience to some simple mercenary grunt. They say you even got a special reward for yer meddlin'.
11218 : In any case, whatever you reported has the Empress all worked up about dead corsairs an' pirate ships.
11219 : So now they're investin' military resources into further investigation. Namely, me an' me troops.
11220 : Now do you get why I'm so eager to inflict bodily harm upon yer person?
11221 : (Hang on a bit... This might be a stroke o' luck...)
11222 : You see, we've been ordered to clear out those walkin' corsair corpses and search the bowels of that ghost ship.
11223 : If we find anythin' that might be used against the Empire, we're s'posed to destroy it.
11224 : All that's turned up so far is a pile o' gold and silver, and other bits and trinkets.
11225 : I guess they're afraid that somethin' else potentially...embarrassin'...is mixed in with all that treasure.
11226 : Hm? What's this now?
11227 : All this talk o' treasure finally get yer attention?
11228 : Got your attention? Indeed you do. Not interested.
11229 : Gwahahaha! What else would you expect from a mercenary!?
11230 : (Now to reel [him/her] in...)
11231 : Is that right...?
11232 : Salaheem's Sentinels treats you well enough, is that it?
11233 : Do I look like a clueless foreigner to you? Everyone around here knows Naja's reputation.
11234 : You're probably dyin' fer a chance to make some real money.
11235 : (This one's a tough nut to crack. Let's give 'em one more shot...)
11236 : If you're interested in our assignment, I'd be happy to cut you in on the action.
11237 : Sure, you'll be flyin' in the face o' danger, but no risk means no reward, right?
11238 : The thing is, I'll have to pull some strings so me superiors'll let a mercenary take the place o' the Maelstrom Company. That'll take greasin' some palms, if you know what I mean.
11239 : You do know what I mean, don't you? Mo-ney. That's right, the shiny stuff you keep in yer purse.
11240 : The amount'll depend on the type o' mission you decide to undertake.
11241 : I won't bore you with the details until you're absolutely sure.
11242 : I'll be here when you make up yer mind.
11243 : I knew you'd show up again. Let's get down to business.
11244 : Here's a list of missions I can let you in on.
11245 : Which do you ask about? None. Scouting the Ashu Talif. Royal Painter Escort. Targeting the Captain.
11246 : Scouting the Ashu Talif Objective: Defeat the Ashu Talif crew Recruitment: 1-6 mercenaries
11247 : Royal Painter Escort Objective: Escort the Royal Painter Recruitment: 1-6 mercenaries
11248 : Targeting the Captain Objective: Eliminate the captain Recruitment: 1-6 mercenaries
11249 : I'm gonna need # ) fer that mission.
11250 : Anything else you wanna ask about?
11251 : If you wanna keep yer head on yer shoulders, you'll keep these transactions to yerself. On yer way.
11252 : Right, so I'm takin' yer # % in exchange fer lettin' you take on %.
11253 : Make yer way to the cutter docked on the west side of Dvucca Isle. I'll make arrangements for yer passage.
11254 : The honor o' the Maelstrom Company rests on yer shoulders. Don't make me hunt you down.
11255 : I don't have any other missions fer you right now. Why don't you finish the one yer on first?
11256 : You're already on that mission, you melon-headed mercenary! Probably forget yer head if it weren't stuck to yer shoulders...
11257 : I don't have any other missions fer you right now. Anything else you want to ask about?
11258 : Oooh, lots of Qiqirn here!

11317 : Adventurer!
11318 : Phew... These Qiqirn are creepy.
11319 : A letter? For me?
11320 : This...this is a note from...
11321 : I knew it... That girl is with him...
11322 : Off on an adventure...!?
11323 : I suppose he has been eating well lately, and his health has been remarkably stable...
11324 : But we can't let the boss go wandering around the wilds at his age!
11325 : I'm gonna go bring him back...!
11326 : Wait...
11327 : Do you remember when we were adventurers, free to roam the world as we pleased?
11328 : Sure, there were times when we went hungry, and times when we got hurt.
11329 : But I wouldn't trade those memories for anything.
11330 : If this is what our master wants, then we should stand behind his decision.
11331 : But...
11332 : He'll be just fine if Faihal is with him. We all know how strong she is.
11333 : Yes, almost unnaturally so...
11334 : It's time we returned to the mansion.
11335 : We have a duty to protect our master's estate.
11336 : That way, he'll always have a home to come back to.
11337 : You're right!
11338 : I...
11339 : I know he'll be back someday!
11340 : Let us return to Al Zahbi. We have a mansion to guard!
11341 : Oh, I almost forgot.
11342 : There was something else here besides the letter.
11343 : Thank you for helping our master realize his dreams.
11344 : % hands Galiwao the %.
11345 : You see a single, ivory venture roll die on the table. There are currently #/# other players wishing to participate.
11346 : What would you like to do? Join table (# gil). Leave. Read manual.
11347 : There are currently #/# players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)
11348 : You place # gil in the pot.
11349 : The final participant has arrived. Your group is allowed # [minute/minutes] at the table.
11350 : %'s primary roll is #!
11351 : Double up? (Currently: #) Yes. No.
11352 : % doubles up... Your venture roll total is now #!
11353 : % doubles up... BUST!!!
11354 : % holds fast.
11355 : Double up complete.
11356 : Results...
11357 : %'s final total is #!
11358 : % has gone BUST!
11359 : The game has ended in a draw!
11360 : The winner is %!
11361 : Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.
11362 : The final place at the table has already been taken.
11363 : You do not have enough gil.
11364 : Someone has dropped the die!
11365 : Read which chapter? 1. The Heart of Venture Roll. 2. Rules of the Roll. 3. Putting the Book Down.
11366 : Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.
11367 : Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (doubling up) as many times as the table time limit allows (# [minute/minutes], Earth time).
11368 : In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (hold fast).
11369 : If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.
11370 : Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).
11371 : Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.
11372 : If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a draw and all participation fees are repaid in full.

11384 : Mgwah!
11385 : Daaarling! Have you ever seen such a quaint little villette?
11386 : Why, this place is just overfluctuating with Qiqirn!
11387 : Wonderful!
11388 : Ever since last week, I've wanted to grab one of those cute, cuddly fluffmuffins and give it a big hug. And now...
11389 : It's like we've died and gone to Nashmau!
11390 : You can say that again, my dearestine!
11391 : Ah! Kookywoon!
11392 : Well, I'll be.
11393 : What have we here?
11394 : Nooo! Eeevil babeee of Tarooo find Kakka!
11395 : Kookywoooooon!
11396 : Kookywoon wun away...<snuffle>...and go...bye-bye...<sniffle>
11397 : Waaaaaaaaahhh!
11398 : Look, honey, Rapipi's crying!
11399 : And aren't you sooo cute when you're upset? Yes you are! Yes you are!
11400 : Well, don't just stand there like a lumberwielder. Tell me my daughter is cute when she cries. Come on.
11401 : Honeymuffin, are you talking to strangers again?
11402 : Well, is she cute? Cuter than a button. Can't tell from this angle.
11403 : Are you calling my Rapipi ugly!? I should have you tied up and tossed into a pit of saberteething tigers! How could you not just melt when you see her...
11404 : ...roundocular eyes!
11405 : Her miniaturesque paws!
11406 : Her pretticular touche!
11407 : Hey! You'd better keep your eyes off her touche if you know what's good for you.
11408 : No, there's not a thing in this world that I wouldn't do for my expialafragilistic daughter. Even if it meant eating a Qiqirn's brain!
11409 : You can't eat their brains, Muffinsickle, they have fleas.
11410 : Speaking of Qiqirn, where did Rapipi's little friend go anyway?
11411 : Rapipi only wanted to play with him, not eat his brain or anything!
11412 : Oh, were you still there?
11413 : I guess we ought to introducicate ourselves. As you might have already realized, we're from out of town.
11414 : My name is Rutta-Watta, father of Rapipi.
11415 : And this is Eohoh, mother of Rapipi.
11416 : And this is Rapipi, Rapipi of Rapipi.
11417 : The three of us came to this island in search of something warm and fuzzy!
11418 : You see, my husband and I love all things cute and cuddly, and we have spent the last five years roaming the globe in search of things that meet our strict standards.
11419 : While in Mhaura, we heard a tale of fuzzular beastmen from an old man with a fish in his pocket. While he and his fish were not that cute, his tale was, and so we decided to come here to investigate.
11420 : And we couldn't leave our precious sugarcake Rapipi at home, could we?
11421 : Why, that would just make this place all the less cute!
11422 : And now that we're here...
11423 : Wapipi woves cute Kooky-wikis!
11424 : You see! Rapipi approves!
11425 : But Rapipi wants to make friends with the fuzzies, don't you, Sweetbiscuit?
11426 : Kookywoon!
11427 : Yes, Kookyroon. Where could that marvelous marsupioid be?
11428 : The nerve of that beast to run from my daughter! He should be gutted and stuffed!
11429 : And then Rapipi could play with him every day now, couldn't you? Yes you could!
11430 : But nooo, the flea-infestified scruffmonger has completely disregarded my daughter's happiness!
11431 : Daddy, I'm hungwy.
11432 : If only there were some kind of magic that would force Qiqirn to love our daughter, then we wouldn't be in this pickle!
11433 : And if not magic, at least some type of trick...
11434 : Yes... Some type of fantastical trick that would lure the Qiqirn close enough so we could...
11435 : I'm hungwy! Hungwy! Hungwy! Hungwy!
11437 : Oh, I'm sorry, Rapipi!
11438 : Let's go get some piping-hot Nashmau stew right now!
11439 : Good day, adventurist!
11440 : Here's wishing you a wonderful trip. Wherever you may be going.
11441 : Is safe, no? Eeevil babeee of Tarooo say gooodbye, no?
11442 : Kakka hate all things eeevil. Kakka hate all things babeee. Kakka hate all things Tarooo. Kakka hate all things eeevil babeee of Tarooo.
11443 : Kakka 'fraid tooo come out from places of hiding.
11444 : Kakka want tooo beee with Nadeee. Nadeee understand heart of Kakka.
11445 : But Kakka go sailing over sloshing seees. Pyopyo sad like Kakka...
11446 : Nadeee not Qiqirn, but Nadeee not Tarooo. Nadeee loves Kakka and Kakka loves Nadeee... Nadeee...

11572 : A splendiforous idea, dear.
11573 : Rapipi! It's time to go. Say goodbye to your new friends.

11595 : Hm? Oh, I guess you'll be wanting something for your time.
11596 : The Qiqirn told us what you did for our little Rapipi.
11597 : Consider these a token of our thanks.
11598 : No one can put a price tag on Rapipi's happinesstness, except for her parents.
11599 : Rapipi come back to play with Leleroon, ya?

11612 : Everyone have linkshell! Everyone friends, ya?
11613 : Everybodeee have linkshell...?
11614 : Uh...
11615 : Everybodeee have, but Kakkaroon no have! Sisiroon is everybodeee, but Kakkaroon is nobodeee!
11616 : Eh... Um...
11617 : Noooooo!
11618 : Kakkaroon hate everybodeee!
11619 : ...
11620 : Hrmmm...
11621 : Whatever, ya?
11622 : Everybodeee have, but Kakkaroon no have! Sisiroon is everybodeee, but Kakkaroon is nobodeee!
11623 : <Sigh>...
11624 : You obtain two %, two %, and three %.
11625 : Kilusha glares at you.
11626 : Hmph... Worthless.
11627 : Ah, finally someone who may be of use.
11628 : Might you be one of those self-proclaimed adventurers?
11629 : Excellent... Now lend me your ears for a moment, and I shall let you in on a proposition that is sure to benefit the both of us.
11630 : To the west of this dreary village lies the infamous Hazhalm Testing Grounds, currently off-limits to all but the Empire's highest-ranking officials.
11631 : And why has the research facility been shut down, you ask?
11632 : Once, long ago, a tiny portal was accidentally opened during one of our experiments.
11633 : Oh, nothing drastic occurred, just a few mice slipped through the gate before the scientists closed it back up.
11634 : However, instead of attempting to solve the insignificant problem that arose, the witless Imperial officials simply sealed off the facilities rather than admit they had done anything wrong.
11635 : A travesty to science, if you ask me.
11636 : I, personally, was on the verge of deciphering the paradigm of Life, when they forced me from my research. They did not even allow me to gather my notes!
11637 : Just one more step... One more step and I would have reached the realm of the gods!
11638 : But thanks to the blundering of the Empire's pawns, the realization of Paradise has been thrust back centuries!
11639 : And that is why I require your assistance in regaining access to the grounds.
11640 : Your job is simple.
11641 : You need merely travel to the sealed facilities and rid it of its pest problem.
11642 : Now let me explain how you are to go about doing so...
11643 : The seal upon Hazhalm is of a powerful magic.
11644 : However, through my studies of mice retina, I have discovered a type of light that can temporarily reduce the potency of the seal, allowing one to pass beyond it.
11645 : Using this special % at the gates to the testing grounds will grant you entrance into the facilities.
11646 : And the lamp is yours for just a mere # gil.
11647 : You question my motives for this request of remuneration when it is you who will be doing the work?
11648 : To question is to learn... You may have the potential to become a fine alchemist.
11649 : But that is not what you wish to know, is it? Well, then let me put it simply--what if you were to take this expensive lamp down to the local market and peddle it off to the highest bidder? Just as you question my motives, I am inclined to question yours.
11650 : And so the fee I require for the lamp can be thought of as insurance: a piece of good mind, you might say.
11651 : Ah yes, but unlike us scientists, striving to help a fellow neighbor out of the goodness of one's heart is not the way of the adventurer, now, is it?
11652 : But you need worry not. Do recall I said this endeavor would benefit both of us.
11653 : Each of the vermin that scampers about the testing grounds' chambers can be identified by a unique code contained within its blood cells.
11654 : Bringing the blood of your victims back here will prove to me that you have eradicated them.
11655 : Based on the number of ampoules you bring, I can reward you accordingly.
11656 : And no, the compensation I offer in return for your services does not consist of worthless pennies of bronze, silver, or mythril.
11657 : I know you adventurers, and I know the treasures you desire. I have collected a fine assortment of items that are most certain to whet the appetite of any seeking something unique. So, have I piqued your interest in my proposal?
11658 : What do you require of me?
11659 : What would you like to know? Nothing. About compensation. About the %. About entry conditions. Care regarding %. Care regarding %. Obtaining ampoules of therion ichor. About re-entry conditions. About battles in Hazhalm.
11660 : Ah, want is the mother of all necessity, no?
11661 : Which would you like to examine?
11662 : You currently possess # [ampoule/ampoules]. Quit. Next page. %. %. %. %. %.
11663 : You currently possess # [ampoule/ampoules]. Previous page. Next page. %. %. %. %. %.
11664 : You currently possess # [ampoule/ampoules]. Previous page. First page. %. %. %. %. %.
11665 : You currently possess # [ampoule/ampoules]. Previous page. First page. %. %. %. %.
11666 : You currently possess # [ampoule/ampoules]. Quit. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
11667 : Ah, a fine choice. I will require # [ampoule/ampoules] as payment.
11668 : Shall we proceed with the exchange?
11669 : Unfortunately, it seems that you do not have that many.
11670 : You currently possess # [ampoule/ampoules]. Exchange. Keep looking.
11671 : Are you sure? Yes! Actually, no.
11672 : I see prudence is a virtue not yet lost.
11673 : Accept your prize, fine adventurer.
11674 : Excellent.
11675 : You hand Kilusha # [ampoule/ampoules].
11676 : When traded to the Hazhalm Testing Grounds' Entry Gate, % will light and become %.
11677 : From that moment, the owner of the % will reserve and gain access to one of the facility's many chambers.
11678 : By using the % it will produce a replica of itself which can be given to another, granting him or her access to the same chamber.
11679 : Though an infinite number of lamps can be produced using this method, only a maximum of thirty-six people can venture into the same chamber.
11680 : Once thirty-six souls have crossed the seal, all lamps outside the grounds will cease to function.
11681 : These lamps will also cease to function the instant any adventurer within the chamber engages in battle, regardless of how many people have already passed through the gates.
11682 : To teleport to the reserved chamber, one must simply trade their % to the Entry Gate.
11683 : However, please note that not everyone in possession of a lamp will be allowed into Hazhalm.
11684 : As mentioned before, only up to thirty-six people may enter a chamber. Even those with a valid % will not be allowed entry if the chamber has reached its maximum capacity.
11685 : Also, as a safety precaution, players below level sixty and those with the Battlefield status in effect will be denied entry.
11686 : Trading % to the Entry Gate found in the Hazhalm Testing Grounds will cause it to transform into %.
11687 : For the player making the chamber reservation alone, entry into the second wing requires one valkyrie feather from the first wing, and entry into the third wing requires one feather from the second wing. % may be used in place of the feathers.
11688 : Gaining access to the most remote chamber in the testing grounds, Valgrind, requires the player conducting this trade to possess three valkyrie feathers--one from each wing.
11689 : If this condition is not met, the % will not transform into % when traded to the Entry Gate.
11690 : Entry into a chamber which has been reserved requires players to trade % to the Entry Gate.
11691 : The player who initially reserved the chamber must enter first before other players will be granted access.
11692 : While there are several conditions which must be fulfilled to successfully trade %, the trading of % has essentially no prerequisites.
11693 : Simply possessing % generated by the player who reserved the chamber is enough to make one eligible for entry.
11694 : In the case of Valgrind, all entering players must possess a minimum of one valkyrie feather from each wing, for a total of at least three feathers per player.
11695 : If this condition is not met, trading % to the Entry Gate will not result in the player being transported to the reserved chamber.
11696 : Ampoules of therion ichor are obtained in the Hazhalm Testing Grounds through the slaying of all enemies except for the Guardians of Asgarth.
11697 : Should a player not successfully complete a chamber or exit prematurely, ampoules will still be awarded in proportion to the number of kills for which they were present.
11698 : Ampoules will only be granted in the event of either a forced exit due to time expiration, or a player voluntarily disposing of the % in their possession.
11699 : After visiting the testing grounds, one must wait # [hour/hours] (Earth time) before he is granted access again.
11700 : This not only pertains to the chamber previously visited, but all areas within the testing grounds.
11701 : The amount of waiting time remaining before re-entry is permitted can be viewed by checking Hazhalm's Entry Gate.

11802 : Yoyoroon's nooose never lies...well, almooost never. Yooo trust Yoyoroon, nooo? Then yooo trust [him/her].
11803 : I see. Forgive my ill manners. One in my line of work can never exercise enough caution.
11804 : As for this % you seek, I fear I've not laid eyes on one for some time.
11805 : According to our ancestral records, they were a common sight in Ephramad's heyday, a sort of good luck charm gifted to Kingdom soldiers before they departed for the battlefield.
11806 : Little good it did most of them, of course. Why, those left behind by their fallen bearers still sleep in Arrapago, no doubt, untouched save by the elements for all these years.
11807 : A thorough search of the area would likely turn one up, I'd wager. Of course, the telltale emblems would scarce be recognizable...
11808 : ...
11809 : Though it gives me pause, I have learned to trust my partner's nose. If you acquire such a %, you may entrust its restoration to me.
11810 : Mind you, some may be so badly deteriorated as to make even the attempt impossible.
11811 : I ask for no fee. The chance to restore a piece of our history--even a simple trinket--to its former glory... This is payment enough for me.
11812 : Ah, but perhaps...
11813 : Yoyoroon has a fondness for sweets, you see. Back in my traveling days, I would bring him delicacies from across the land, but these days my work affords me little opportunity to leave the shop.
11814 : Along with the talisman, perhaps you could bring him a treat from his favorite teahouse in Al Zahbi? It'd be sure to put a smile on his face and a spring in his step.
11815 : Thank you, friend. Be safe in your travels.
11816 : Sweets randomizer: #.
11817 : Double sweets delivered.

11833 : And % for Yoyoroon, as well.
11834 : And % and % for Yoyoroon, as well.
11835 : Look at that. He's quite literally drooling with glee. Thank you, friend. We won't forget your kindness.
11836 : As for the % you brought, it seems to have weathered the years better than most. It should not present too much of a challenge to restore.
11837 : And with that, I'd best get to work. Come back a bit later, and I guarantee you'll be pleased with what you see.
11838 : ...Aroon?
11839 : The nice [man/lady] was blooo wizarooon!? Why yooo keep secret from Yoyoroon!?
11840 : But Yoyoroon know! Yes he dooo! Yooo not mean wizarooon, no no nooo.
11841 : Yoyoroon nooose never lies, no. Yooo smell same as other nice blooo wizarooon, yooo do.
11842 : Roooshfee nice to Yoyoroon, yes. Yooo bring him visit Yoyoroon next time, nooo?
11843 : Give a treat to Yoyoroon? %. %. Both.
11844 : Ah, welcome back, friend. This is for you. One %, restored as closely as possible to its original glory.
11845 : Is it not exquisite? The intricate detail of the crest...one can scarce believe it was fashioned centuries ago.
11846 : Gazing upon it now, I can almost hear the sounds of the waves caressing the shores of the homeland I never knew.
11847 : Forgive me...this is not the time for maudlin nostalgia.
11848 : I needn't remind you that the artifact you now carry is strictly prohibited in the Empire. Take care not to be seen with it in your possession. Be well, friend.
11849 : Gadzoookaroooooons!
11850 : Oh...it just yooo.
11851 : I see blooo wizarooon and think no-no-nooo...this bye-bye for pooor Yoyoroon!
11852 : Yooo promise no more scary-scary for Yoyoroon, yooo dooo?
11853 : Yooo come back to visit Yoyoroon? Yooo have business with boss, yooo dooo?
11854 : Boss! Yoyoroon bring good customer back! Yooo happy with Yoyoroon, no?
11855 : ...I see. So you'll be wanting another %, won't you? Leave it to me.
11856 : I'll just need you to bring me %...
11857 : Yoyoroon gazes pleadingly at %, his tummy rumbling...
11858 : And, ah...a treat or two for Yoyoroon.
11859 : Ohorooon! Yoyoroon work soooper hard for his favorite customer!
11860 : Yoyoroon and I will be waiting for you here. Safe travels!
11861 : This %... Yes, everything seems to be in order.
11862 : I'll begin the restoration immediately. Come by my shop again a bit later, would you?
11863 : Press button to proceed.
11864 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
11865 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
11866 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
11867 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
11868 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
11869 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
11870 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
11871 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
11872 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
11873 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
11874 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
11875 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
11876 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
11877 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
11878 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
11879 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
11880 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
11881 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
11882 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
11883 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
11884 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
11885 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
11886 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
11887 : Deal, kupo? (Current gil: #). Check storable items. Deal. No deal.
11888 : The % will allow you to store the following items:

11893 : Warning! If you lose your % while storing a corresponding item, you will be forever unable to retrieve that item!

11897 : Retrieve %? Retrieve it. Leave it.

11899 : Kupo? I'm already taking care of that item for you.
11900 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
11901 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
11902 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
11903 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
11904 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
11905 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.
11906 : Why, it looks as if you have % located in your [inventory/Mog Safe/Mog Safe 2/Mog House storage/Mog Locker/Mog Satchel/Mog Sack/Mog Case/Mog Wardrobe/Mog Wardrobe 2/Mog Wardrobe 3/Mog Wardrobe 4/Mog Wardrobe 5/Mog Wardrobe 6/Mog Wardrobe 7/Mog Wardrobe 8/Recycle Bin]!
