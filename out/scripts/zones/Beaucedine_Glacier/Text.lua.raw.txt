6975 : [/I've gained a fair amount of experience./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./Hmm./I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level./I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./I've come a long way towards my next level./We've been busy, huh?/I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level.] [/I must be close to halfway to my next level by now./Can't slow down now!/I must be almost halfway to my next level by now./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!/That was much faster than I expected./No time to be slacking off!/Must be close to halfway by now./I think I'm almost halfway to my next level./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!]
6976 : I've gained a fair amount of experience. I must be close to halfway to my next level by now.
6977 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
6978 : Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
6979 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6980 : I think I'm about half way there...
6981 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6982 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6983 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
6984 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
6985 : I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.
6986 : We've been busy, huh? I think I'm almost halfway to my next level.
6987 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6988 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.
6989 : I'm halfway there...maybe?
6990 : [/Hmm./This is a good pace!/Hmm./Well, well./Just a little more./Come on!/I'm past the halfway point./Just a little more!/Well, well.] [/Not too much further to my next level./Not much more to my next level!/Still need a little more experience for my next level./It appears my next level is not far off at all./My next level is not too far away./I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!/Not long now until I gain another level./My next level is almost within sight!/It appears my next level is not far off at all.]
6991 : Hmm. Not too much further to my next level.
6992 : This is a good pace! Not much more to my next level!
6993 : Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
6994 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6995 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
6996 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
6997 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
6998 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
6999 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
7000 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
7001 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
7002 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7003 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
7004 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?
7005 : [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
7006 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
7007 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
7008 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
7009 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7010 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
7011 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7012 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7013 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7014 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7015 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7016 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7017 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7018 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7019 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7020 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7021 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7022 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7023 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7024 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7025 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7026 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7027 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7028 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7029 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7030 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7031 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7032 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7033 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7034 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7035 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7036 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7037 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7038 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7039 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7040 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7041 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7042 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7043 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7044 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7045 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7046 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7047 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7048 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7049 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7050 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7051 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7052 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7053 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7054 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7055 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7056 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7057 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7058 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7059 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7060 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7061 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7062 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7109 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7110 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7111 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7112 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7113 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7114 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7115 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7116 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7117 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7118 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7119 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7120 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7121 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7122 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7123 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7124 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7125 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7126 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7127 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7128 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7129 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7130 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7131 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7132 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7384 : Welcome, friend, to the Elemental Casket of Mystique and Mystery, kupo! The what?, you say? I thought you'd never ask!
7385 : Why, it's a riveting and remarkably rewarding game in which you can procure precious prizes simply by surmising a single number!
7386 : So what do you say, kupo!? Sure, I'll play. No thanks, kupo.
7387 : Awww...what a spoilsport, kupo! This festival won't be around forever, so come back soon if you change your mind!
7388 : That's the spirit, kupo!
7389 : First you'll have to speak with my Gobbie associate stationed just outside the tower southeast of here.
7390 : He'll tell you all you need to know, kupo!
7391 : Successfully snag the contents of the casket and bring it back to me, and spoils most spectacular await you!
7392 : We're all cheering for you, so give it your best shot, kupo!
7393 : Could it be? Why yes, ladies and gentlemoogles, it looks like [he's/she's] done it! One % acquired!
7394 : What's that? Why do we need explosives, you say?
7395 : Wh-why, uh...no particular reason at all, kupo! It's just for the...ah...yes, the closing ceremony fireworks, of course! Why, it's a Mog Festival tradition, you know!
7396 : Anyway, I'll just be taking that %, thankyouverymuch! And here's your reward: %, kupo! Let's give [him/her] a big round of applause, folks!
7397 : Where are the prizes I promised, you say? Why, just bring that % to my associate in Xarcabard for the next exciting event, and they're as good as yours! Good luck...you'll need it, kupo!
7398 : Yeah, whaddaya want? You wanna play the tr-tr-treasure game, ya say? Hah! You d-d-don't even have a %! Come back with one, m-m-maybe we talk!
7399 : Yeah? I'm a b-b-busy Gobbie. I've got better things to do than listen to your y-y-yammerin'.
7400 : Yeah, whaddaya w-w-want? You wanna tr-tr-try your hand at the tr-tr-treasure game, ya say? Step r-r-right up and I'll tell ya how it's played!
7401 : Ya need'ta hear the r-r-rules? Sure do! Already heard 'em.
7402 : Simple g-g-game, simple rules. Unlock treasure chest, get stuff inside. Bring said stuff back to the m-m-moogle emcee. Easy as Goblin pie, no?
7403 : But here's the c-c-catch... We've locked the chest with a super-secret m-m-magic number. Ya'll have to visit six spots s-s-scattered around this glacier. Elementals pop up, they m-m-mark the magic number on your %.
7404 : Guess wrong or leave the area, and ya gotta do it all over again. Hey, nobody said this would be e-e-easy! What? I did!? Sh-sh-shut up!
7405 : Ya ain't f-f-found hardly any elementals. Didn't ya hear me the first time? Six s-s-spots scattered across the glacier! Now get crackin'!
7406 : What d-d-day was it again? Oh yeah, today's [Firesday/Earthsday/Watersday/Windsday/Iceday/Lightningday/Lightsday/Darksday]... And t-t-tomorrow's [Firesday/Earthsday/Watersday/Windsday/Iceday/Lightningday/Lightsday/Darksday]... ...Hmm?
7407 : Whaddaya w-w-want? Nothing. Tell me the rules. Gimme a hint. I'm ready to open the chest.
7408 : Ya really want a h-h-hint? Not smart enough to f-f-figure it out on your own, eh?
7409 : Ya s-s-sure? On second thought, forget it. Hook me up.
7410 : Okay, you're the b-b-boss. The magic number is [five or h-h-higher/l-l-less than five]. If ya can c-c-count that high...
7411 : What? Another h-h-hint? Aren't you supposed to be smarter'n us G-G-Gobbies?
7412 : Ya really need another hint? No, not really. Yes, really.
7413 : The magic number is [o-o-odd/e-e-even].
7414 : I ain't g-g-got any more hints for ya. Use your own b-b-brains now...if ya got any.
7415 : Ya sure ya got the answer? Remember, ya only gets one g-g-guess.
7416 : Ready to g-g-guess? Uh, no. Ready as I'll ever be.
7417 : Enter a single digit between 0 and 9.
7418 : Ooh...#, you s-s-say? Is that your f-f-final answer?
7419 : #? That's your answer? On second thought... I'm sure of it!
7420 : #... [He/She] s-s-says #, ladies and g-g-gobs! Now it's t-t-time for the moment of truth! Will [he/she] go home a champ, or a ch-ch-chump?
7421 : Well, smack my g-g-gob and call me a Goobbue! [He's/She's] done it! [He's/She's] really d-d-done it!
7422 : T-t-take this here %, and bring it back to the moogle for your hard earned r-r-reward! And let's give [him/her] a r-r-rousing round of applause!
7423 : Can ya believe it, f-f-folks!? [He/She] landed the loot without needing a single l-l-lousy hint! And for that, we've got a s-s-special prize for [him/her]!
7424 : Can ya b-b-believe it, folks!? [He/She] landed the loot with only a single l-l-lousy hint! And for that, we've got a special p-p-prize for [him/her]!
7425 : <Bzzzt!>...Ohhhhhh, I'm sorry! Looks like you chose p-p-poorly. As a parting gift, you get...absolutely n-n-nothing. Better luck next t-t-time!
7426 : The treasure chest remains tightly sealed.
7427 : The mark of [Fire/Earth/Water/Wind/Ice/Lightning/Light/Dark] has been inscribed on your %!
7428 : Hey! What are you doing there?
7429 : Carmelo asked you? You mean he's still...
7430 : Yes, I am the woman he seeks. Why did I leave him? Let's just say that the hands of his clock were about to break.
7431 : In those days, he would do anything to make me happy. Anything! He even sold the one thing that brought us together to buy me something that would make me more happy.
7432 : I'm not mad about that, it's just that...I felt that if I had stayed, he would have thrown away everything--all that he cherished, all that he was--just for me.
7433 : I feared he would throw away his future for the sake of our present. Eventually, his time would have come to a stop.
7434 : I told him that we were like the hands of a clock... That even if we parted, we would meet again.
7435 : But he wanted us to stay where both hands met...even if that meant breaking the gears that kept us in motion.
7436 : Try to stop time...and you'll only break the hands of the clock.
7437 : Tell him that as long as we live, we will meet again--as long as the hands of the clock are moving.
7438 : The surface of the lake shines like a mirror.
7439 : B-b-brrrrrr... It's f-f-freezing...It's f-f-freezy-weezing...
7440 : B-b-brrrrrr... I f-f-feel like a P-P-Potete p-p-popsicle...
7441 : We are researchers f-f-from the Rhinostery in Windurst, assisting M-m-minister Rukususu with unraveling the m-m-mystery that surrounds this p-p-place. Our p-p-progress has b-b-been somewhat f-f-frozen, though...
7442 : What do you want? Really-weally? You came from Windurst? Yes, we're researchers from the Rhinostery...
7443 : Doctor Shantotto's message is... How is the new magic working? Reply immediately or be cursed! You total loser!
7444 : Wh-wh-what! How dare you call me a loser-woser!
7445 : Goddess!  That's the message from Doctor Shantotto!? We're doomed!
7446 : Wh-wh-what! If Doctor Shantotto asked that, she must be furious!
7447 : W-w-well, we did receive the new magic from Doctor Shantotto...
7448 : But when we tried to take it to Minister Rukususu, the writing disappeared, leaving it completely unusable.
7449 : After bringing the new magic back here, we managed to get the writing to appear again, but the same thing happens every time we try to take it to the minister.
7450 : It must be some evil-wevil influence of the Fei'Yin ruins, although I can't pinpointaru it exactly.
7451 : Maybe it has something to do with our connection to the Rhinostery. Hey, you can take this to Minister Rukususu in our place!
7452 : Accept his request? Alrightaru. Sorry, not today.
7453 : Oh, so you don'taru mind being cursed by Doctor Shantotto, then? If you give up and go home, she'll turn your bones into jelly-welly!
7454 : Minister Rukususu is in a small chamber on Fei'Yin's lower level. Come straight back here if the writing disappears before you reach her.
7455 : Minister Rukususu is in a small chamber on Fei'Yin's lower level. Come straight back here if the writing disappears before you reach her.
7456 : This must be a pretty unbelievable place for a city dweller like you. But if you think this is strangey-wangey, just waitaru you see the ruins of Fei'Yin!
7457 : We are investigating the mystery that shrouds this land, just as the Multinational Expedition members did 30 years ago.
7458 : The minister is not in any danger. If anything happened, she could just whisk herself back to town with her magic. Things often get a little hairy-wairy for me, though, since I can't do that warpy thingy...
7459 : I wish Doctor Shantotto's new magic would hurry up and work...
7460 : So, it didn't work, huh?
7461 : I'll work on restoring the writing so you can try again tomorrow.
7462 : The writing has reappeared. Go give it another shot!
7463 : Hey! You did it! We're saved!
7464 : Now all you have to do is tell Doctor Shantotto. Don'taru dawdle-wawdle on the way back, or it'll be your neck on the line!
7465 : The Multinational Expedition of thirty years past lost two of their members in this area.
7466 : Mr. Iru-Kuiru, who had joined the company from Windurst, managed to return to the Federation safely...but lost his life through highly unusual circumstances somewhere to the south.
7467 : You don't think...? Could it have been a curse!? B-b-brrrrr...!
7468 : Apparently, Mr. Iru-Kuiru had been researching Tarutaru origins around here.
7469 : You've heard the legend, rightaru? In days of old, wanderers suffering from cold and starvation were led to this place by a shining star...
7470 : But fanciful-wanciful research like that is not taken very seriously, is it?  As a result, Mr. Iru-Kuiru was expelled from the Rhinostery.
7471 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
7472 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7473 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7474 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7482 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7483 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7484 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7485 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7486 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7487 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7488 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7489 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7490 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7491 : You've earned conquest points!
7492 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7493 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7494 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7495 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7496 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7497 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7498 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7499 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7500 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7501 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7502 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7503 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7504 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7505 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7506 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7507 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7508 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7509 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7510 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7511 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7512 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7513 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7514 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7515 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7516 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7517 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7518 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7519 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7520 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7521 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7522 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7523 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7524 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7525 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7526 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7527 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7528 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?

7529 : Which E.F. would you like to join? . . . . . . The Zulkheim Region (Lv.20). The Norvallen Region (Lv.25). . The Derfland Region (Lv.25). . The Kolshushu Region (Lv.20).

7530 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
7531 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
7532 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
7533 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
7534 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
7535 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
7536 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.
7537 : You currently have # conquest points. Would you like to use them to purchase items?

7620 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
7621 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.

7623 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.

7627 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
7628 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.

7835 : Oooh, nice! He says, You're going be in for a grrreataru year with oodles of elation!
7836 : That was, Justaru the rrright amount of happiness is going to be coming your way!
7837 : That translates to, You win some, you lose some. But on the whole, there's no rrreason-weason why you should be pessimistic!
7838 : Uh-oh! That was, You'll need to dig deepy-weep for some luck of your own this yearrr!
7839 : Hrrrm... Rather than interpretaru that, let me just say, whatever happens this year, always rememberrr to keep your chinny-win up!

7852 : Ahahahahaha! You're almost on top of it! It's somewhere in this area!
7853 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7854 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la

7886 : % and % cannot be used here.
7887 : %... Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to. The time left to me is short.
7888 : Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...
7889 : I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me... It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...
7890 : Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.
7891 : A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.
7892 : My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully. Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.
7893 : Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world. You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete. My hopes go with you, %.
7894 : There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.
7895 : There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.
7896 : The strands of grass here have been tied together.
7897 : There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.
7898 : I see you have met with Raogrimm. His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.
7899 : In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.
7900 : You will need the %, a key that bridges the void between Vana'diel and that other world.
7901 : It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The % is one of those items.
7902 : You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the %. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...
7903 : That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.
7904 : Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.
7905 : The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.
7906 : We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.
7907 : Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the % to guide you...
7908 : I never believed that my indifference to the state of other nations would cause harm to my beloved San d'Oria...
7909 : As part of my penance, I will infuse the % with what guidance I can.
7910 : I betrayed him... And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...
7911 : Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...
7912 : I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
7913 : Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.
7914 : Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord... This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.
7915 : Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
7916 : Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.
7917 : I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.
7918 : Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.
7919 : Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this %! Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
7920 : There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.
7921 : There is a symbol carved into the rock here.
7922 : I have been waiting for you.
7923 : Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"... Do you understand the significance of these words?
7924 : When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form... Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.
7925 : Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...
7926 : The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.
7927 : Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard.  The next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.
7928 : You must obtain the last trophy. All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.
7929 : Take care, my brave adventurer. May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
7930 : Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning. This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.
7931 : I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death. Is this what they call karma...?
7932 : This land has borne the weight of my sins. I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...
7933 : So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed... Keep your wits aboutaru you, %.
7934 : I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes. Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.
7935 : It is time! Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, %. %! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
7936 : Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a prison of souls.
7937 : Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened. Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...
7938 : It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?
7939 : There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.
7940 : Please pay no mind to my ramblings. You have secured the %. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.
7941 : You will need four such trophies. Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.
7942 : I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...
7943 : Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.
7944 : It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities. If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...
7945 : %. This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.
7946 : When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there. That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.
7947 : What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge. But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...
7948 : That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...
7949 : Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry! I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.
7950 : Now, %. This % is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.
7951 : Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, %. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...
7952 : The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.
7953 : I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.
7954 : Wait, wait, wait! I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but... How can I explain it?
7955 : Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.
7956 : But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order! You've got your paws on the %! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.
7957 : But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.
7958 : % and the four trophies. These artifacts have long been lost to that other world.  The Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.
7959 : It must have been in the time of the Great War... Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.
7960 : Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.
7961 : The % and the %. Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms. Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...
7962 : Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way. However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...
7963 : Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...
7964 : Is it over...?
7965 : No, the rage has merely been dispersed.
7966 : As long as I exist, he will never truly die...
7967 : Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?
7968 : %... You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented. I have not the words to express my gratitude.
7969 : The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more. I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...
7970 : The one who holds sway...?
7971 : Yes. From the center of infinite darkness. I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...
7972 : You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell. The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.
7973 : It was an error in judgment to shelter you... The order of my realm has been disrupted.
7974 : I give to you a duty... You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.
7975 : No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul. No return to the land of blessed light...
7976 : What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness? As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.
7977 : Of one thing I was certain. This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.
7978 : A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.
7979 : Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow. It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.
7980 : Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey. Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.
7981 : %, you may be the one to witness this truth.
7982 : The power stored in the % will soon be drained. And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.
7983 : Do not forget who you are, %. I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.
7984 : My old companions...?
7985 : This duty is too much for just one to bear. If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived. It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.
7986 : That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.
7987 : Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis? I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.
7988 : Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm. I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.
7989 : C'mon, let's see a little excitement! This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.
7990 : It's not the Northlands this time. None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?
7991 : I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain. Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.
7992 : I thought this would be the end of you for sure... Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.
7993 : What, no words for an old friend? Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?
7994 : I betrayed you! I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia! The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!
7995 : Everything began thirty years ago. And there were things that came to an end... Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.
7996 : And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.
7997 : I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions. No matter who that person may be.
7998 : Raogrimm...
7999 : Are you sure you want to do this? This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land. As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...
8000 : Raogrimm. There is no need to suffer alone anymore. Our presence here should answer your question.
8001 : There are crimes that must be atoned for. And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.
8002 : Until the dawn of an age without hatred... No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.
8003 : Cornelia...
8006 : There is a strange symbol drawn here. A haunting chill sweeps through you as you gaze upon it...
8007 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Present the %...if you wish to pass into...my dream.
8008 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: The sands of time yet fall... Present the...%.
8009 : I am the ruler of Dynamis.
8010 : Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs? Either way, this is not your dream.
8011 : The dreamer of this realm is a separate entity than he who dreamt of that wasteland of malice, Xarcabard.
8012 : Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?
8013 : I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.
8014 : While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.
8015 : The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.
8016 : Search for my counterpart, and unite this realm with your own dream.
8017 : A nightmare curses this land yet again.
8018 : Take heed, dream traveler.
8019 : I have been watching your dream.
8020 : But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there. This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.
8021 : You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.
8022 : I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...
8023 : The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.
8024 : Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place... The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.
8025 : The entrance to the dream has already been opened. Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.
8026 : I am...a unique entity...
8027 : We are...comprised of all entities...
8028 : Intermingling with one another...dividing among each other...
8029 : And devouring one another...
8030 : The shadow that you defeated had been consumed by the dreamer of this realm.
8031 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who have come into contact with the Emptiness.
8032 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who came into contact with the Emptiness.
8033 : Could it have been that girl...? When I next see her, she will pay dearly.
8034 : Could it have been that girl...? No, there was one more, transformed after death...
8035 : Her malice will not perish as long as this dream continues, using my shadows to revive countless times.
8036 : You must confront the nightmare and continue to fight them to keep this realm from spreading.
8037 : The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness... Could it have been transferred to another girl...?
8038 : You know this girl well. I could take care of her easily, but if you wish me to spare her, then you will lend me your power.
8039 : Trade the % to the Hieroglyphics found in each area. The % will be transformed into %.

8081 : Wait, there is something I must...
8082 : This place is...?
8083 : I see... You must be the new wielder for these.
8084 : Yes, with your fighting spirit I believe you will be able to master the %.
8085 : The % have long accompanied me, along both rough and gentle paths. It is not easy to give them up, but...here.
8086 : They belong to you now. I ask that you consider my... Ah, but that is past now. I bid you farewell....
8087 : ...
8088 : I hope you don't think this is the end.
8089 : Your real life as a martial artist is just beginning. Time to start your training anew!
8090 : ... Finally! We finally meet face to face!
8091 : I have a presence in this world again! What an exhilarating feeling!
8092 : Ah yes, there is one more thing...
8093 : Eh? What?
8094 : Oh. You must be this one's new owner.
8095 : With your dagger skills, you'll make a perfect wielder for the %.
8096 : It is most difficult to give up a weapon that has seen me through so many tight spots, but you have earned it.
8097 : Treat her well...
8098 : ...
8099 : Splendid! From this day forth, I belong to you.
8100 : So, what kind of games shall we play? And where shall we go to play them? Who are we going to kill when we get there? It's all just too exciting...!
8101 : ... Thou hast found me.
8102 : I have now thrice shown my true form in this world.
8103 : A moment...
8104 : ... What has happened to me?
8105 : I see, you are the sword's new owner?
8106 : Well, this is most encouraging! A master of swordplay such as yourself should have no trouble wielding %.
8107 : When the world lies in chaos, this blade appears before the one meant to wield it. It is yours... Restore order to Vana'diel!
8108 : And now I, too, can rest unburdened...
8109 : ...
8110 : Thou art blessed this day.
8111 : Henceforth, I shall be thy blade. For the sake of thy companions, for justice in this world, wield my power in the name of honor...
8112 : ... You have found me.
8113 : Allow me to show my respect. You who have gained the strength of so many must be a true hero.
8114 : But first...
8115 : Who are you?
8116 : This must be some sort of joke. You are the new wielder of this weapon?
8117 : Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you. With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.
8118 : However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.
8119 : Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind. My regards go with you, stranger...
8120 : ...
8121 : Now, my heroic master...
8122 : For what purpose will you wield my power? The choices before you are without limit. Will you become the ruler of this world? Or perhaps...
8123 : ... You...me, meet.
8124 : Me...free... Thanks to you. Me, your...
8125 : Wait...
8126 : What the...?
8127 : Ah, now I see. The wheel has turned.
8128 : Truthfully spoken, I am thankful. % is a splendid axe, but ever does it hunger.
8129 : I have taken many lives to sate its need, and have reached the end of my strength.
8130 : You have my gratitude. You have freed me from my nightmare, and now I can sleep with a tranquil spirit...
8131 : ...
8132 : You, master, me. Good, work. Me, thank, you.
8133 : Master, me, hunger. Go, hunt? Find, prey? Me, cut, flesh. Break, bone. Drink, blood. Master, me, hunger...
8134 : ... Ah, you found me!
8135 : I have been freed from a world where life and death, reality and illusion are impossible to tell apart. I am truly grateful.
8136 : One moment...
8137 : ... This is...Jeuno!? Have I finally returned?
8138 : I... Nobody can see me. This is merely a reflection of reality. Which means you are the one to inherit the axe.
8139 : Hmm. With your polished skills, you will make a fine master for %.
8140 : The one who wields this axe must also be beautiful to look upon. Apparently, I was a suitable candidate. Do you not agree?
8141 : Congratulations. I expect you to perform great deeds from this day onwards. I also ask that someday you use % to avenge the Hydra Corps...
8142 : ...
8143 : I congratulate you also...my new master.
8144 : Now hold me high and let my blade glint in the sunlight! Let your friends, as well as your enemies, feast upon my glorious beauty!
8145 : ... You have found me.
8146 : My forbidden power is now yours, and I am liberated from my prison.
8147 : You have but to gain her respect...
8148 : Such a long dream I was having...
8149 : It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world. No. I must accept that it was no dream.
8150 : And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did... It seems you have already found your way to %.
8151 : Very well, I will pass it on to you. But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.
8152 : And think long and hard on whether or not this power should be used. Do not end up like me...
8153 : ...
8154 : Heh. Heh heh. Hahahahahahaha!
8155 : Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power? There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...
8156 : ... You have unearthed me at last.
8157 : I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.
8158 : All that remains is...
8159 : Hello? Is it possible that I...
8160 : But, no. I have not returned to this realm... You. You are to be my successor?
8161 : You certainly seem to have the required skill with the lance. Enough to convince % to lend you its power, at any rate.
8162 : Having this spear on the battlefield makes you a match for almost any opponent.
8163 : Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used. You have my admiration, adventurer. You have done well...
8164 : ...
8165 : The ceremony of inheritance is complete.
8166 : It is time for you to go forth and experience my overwhelming strength...
8167 : ... I have been rediscovered at last.
8168 : Thanks to you, I have made my escape from the shrouded land.
8169 : You must now gain the sanction of my master...
8170 : It is a pity, indeed.
8171 : This day has come far too soon for my liking.
8172 : However, you are a master of the ninja trade. I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the %.
8173 : Take this blade as your own. Travel far down the path of the ninja.
8174 : I will be watching you from the shadows...
8175 : ...
8176 : A fine master...
8177 : My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...
8178 : ... This day has finally come.
8179 : I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age. Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?
8180 : In any event...
8181 : What is going on here?
8182 : Ah, my successor has come.
8183 : I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the % and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.
8184 : When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.
8185 : You have my gratitude. Farewell, %...
8186 : ...
8187 : It has been a hard path to reach this point.
8188 : But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun. You have yet to attain perfection. Let us continue your training...
8189 : ... At long last, you have arrived.
8190 : I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...
8191 : You have proven me wrong...
8192 : I have heard of your coming.
8193 : You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?
8194 : Every time % is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor. I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.
8195 : However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now.  If you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.
8196 : Now, take the hammer and go! Just be careful with how you handle it. Do not let its might crush you as well...
8197 : ...
8198 : My might is yours to wield.
8199 : Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...
8200 : ... So, you have found me.
8201 : I must give you my thanks. I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.
8202 : And now...
8203 : Hwaah!
8204 : Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.
8205 : Well, it's for the best, I suppose. In my current state, % is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.
8206 : I entrust this staff to you! Take up %, %, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!
8207 : I take my leave of you now. I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...
8208 : ...
8209 : I am yours to wield.
8210 : But you are not yet my master. By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...
8211 : ... You have discovered my resting place.
8212 : The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more. My thanks.
8213 : Ah, one more test of your patience...
8214 : Where is this place?
8215 : Of course. How could I forget. I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.
8216 : Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary. % will fit snugly into your sure grasp.
8217 : However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke. You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.
8218 : Farewell...
8219 : ...
8220 : It is an honor to be owned by a just master. Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.
8221 : You are now the one to draw me in battle. I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.
8222 : ... We finally meet.
8223 : I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.
8224 : But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...
8225 : Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep. Oh, this place looks familiar...
8226 : Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?
8227 : You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And % would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...
8228 : Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.
8229 : This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...
8230 : ...
8231 : A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.
8232 : Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...
8233 : ... I am saved.
8234 : Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!
8235 : A few more moments, if you please...
8236 : Hello there. I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.
8237 : You've never heard of me? Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.
8238 : To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the %, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.
8239 : But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.
8240 : She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...
8241 : ...
8242 : He was a wonderful performer.
8243 : Let us be on our way. Our tour of the world has only just begun...
8244 : Hm? What is this? %? How do I know this is not some [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] trick?
8245 : Step back, adventurer! I've got much more important things to worry about now!
8246 : What!? A surprise attack by the beastmen!? And today, of all days...
8247 : In a matter of hours, a handful of new squires will be joining our ranks here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8248 : These young patricians are quite spirited, but they lack valuable battle experience.
8249 : While we need be cautious not to disgrace their family names, we cannot let them fall in battle. We request your assistance in protecting the future of San d'Oria!
8250 : It will not be long before a caravan of traders in search of new trade routes arrives here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8251 : If they were to be injured by the enemy, the economy of San d'Oria could fall into chaos. We request your assistance in protecting the prosperity of our kingdom!
8252 : A group of Temple Knights is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe our daily work.
8253 : Ah, but perhaps this could be a perfect chance to show those pampered sissies that being a true knight comprises more than just chasing about shoplifters and sweeping the chateau gardens. However, no matter how much of a grudge we may hold, we cannot let our Elvaan brothers and sisters fall in battle. Understood?
8254 : In a matter of moments, members of the Royal Guards will be arriving here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare us for our next campaign against the beastmen.
8255 : If the fiends are conniving a surprise attack, I expect you to do your best in assuring that no disgrace will be brought upon the guards' names, as well as preventing any unnecessary bloodshed.
8256 : Today, our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] is blessed with the honor of welcoming an ambassador from the fine Republic of Bastok.
8257 : If anything were to happen to our guest, it could transpire into war between our two nations. I expect you to protect the attach with your very life!
8258 : In a few moments, a new batch of legionary recruits will be enlisted to the Republican Army and dispatched here to the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8259 : However, within their ranks are future scientists and craftsmen. Their deaths would be a great loss for the future of our nation.
8260 : We must ensure their safety, but we also must be careful not to prevent them from fulfilling their duties. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8261 : In a matter of minutes, a group of mariners will be arriving at our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] for self-defense training.
8262 : We must provide them with battle experience, but we also must ensure their safety. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8263 : My sources indicate that a party of Gold Musketeers carrying supplies is approaching the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8264 : These soldiers are the best of the best, and more than likely will not require any assistance in the event of an attack. However, if anything were to happen to them...
8265 : Later today, a group of high-ranking officials from Strategic Command will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare for Bastok's next campaign against the beastmen.
8266 : If anything were to happen to the commanders, you and I would both be court-martialed! The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8267 : I have just received word that a group of ambassadors from the Federation of Windurst is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe what measures Bastok has undertaken to maintain stability in the regions under Republican control.
8268 : If the attachs were to be injured on this occasion, the damage suffered to our nations' relationship would be irreparable. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8269 : Shortly, we will be conducting a test for our mercenary candidates here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8270 : This exam is to help us judge the candidates' skill in battle and help us separate those with talent from those who are bound for deskwork.
8271 : But after an attack by the beastmen...there won't be any candidates left to grade! You've got to help us give these kids a fighting chance!
8272 : It won't be long before a party of Federation scholars will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to do research on the local wildlife.
8273 : These scientists are more powerful with their pens than their swords...but that won't help them against a beastman attack! You've got to help us protect them!
8274 : Hmmm... Later today, a small group of Wize Wizards will be arriving to observe our daily work here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8275 : I say that we give them something to remember! %! It's up to you to prove to those bigwigs that we are the ones who maintain the peace in the Federation! Give those beastmen all you've got! (Just don't let the Wize Wizards get hurt...)
8276 : Today, a party of Federation Patriarchs is scheduled to arrive at the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to plan for Windurst's next campaign against the beastmen.
8277 : If anything were to happen to them, we'd all be reassigned to latrine duty! If you know what's good for you, you won't let anyone lay a finger on them!
8278 : Oh, why did the military attachs from San d'Oria have to come to our outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] now?
8279 : I shudder to think what would happen if an ambassador was injured...or worse! Get out there and protect those Elvaan with your life!
8280 : Excellent work! Your efforts helped protect the future of our nation. Divide this among your companions.
8281 : Our nation suffered an enormous loss today. We must begin reinforcing our defenses immediately!
8282 : Your inability to complete the mission has led to our defeat. The last thing our nation needs is an incompetent adventurer!
8283 : You fought hard, and you proved yourself worthy. You are a great asset to the nation.
8284 : We commend you on your services in helping us avert the beastmen's attack. I do not see them attacking us again any time soon.
8285 : This area is currently conducting a Ballista match. I have no time to trouble myself with your beastman trinkets.
8286 : A party member has an NPC called up. You cannot take part in this event.
8287 : The heavy steel grating prevents you from proceeding any further.
8288 : Enter the tower? Yes. No.
8289 : Hey, I found something!
8290 : You found something?
8291 : Show me, show me, show me!
8292 : No, wait. It's a body!
8293 : Just a body? Why does this keep happening to us?
8294 : We gotta go tell someone! But before we do... <rustle, rustle>
8295 : The % has been stolen!
8296 : You three!?
8297 : The % was returned to you!
8298 : Mister Nag'molada!
8299 : We're glad to see you're okay!
8300 : Lady Esha'ntarl was so worried about you!
8301 : We were so worried about you, too!
8302 : I don't need your platitudes! What I need to know is why you three activated the ruins of Pso'Xja!
8303 : Do you realize what you've done!? Or were you just causing trouble as usual?
8304 : It wasn't like that!
8305 : It was Lady Esha'ntarl!
8306 : She asked the adventurers to do it!
8307 : This is Esha'ntarl's doing?
8308 : What could she be up to? Did she activate the ruins to seal Diabolos? Or could it be...?
8309 : Mister Nag'molada was really mad!
8310 : Mister Nag'molada had steam coming out of his ears!
8311 : What do we do? We didn't get the chance to tell him about Prishe. She's still lying in front of that tower over there.
8312 : But even if we leave her like that, she probably won't die.
8313 : But if Prishe finds us, we definitely WILL die.
8314 : Which means...
8315 : We leave her like that and stay alive!
8316 : So the fifth crystal is in Al'Taieu...
8317 : Huh? A girl? Some Elvaan guy brought a dead-looking girl to us. Is that the one?
8318 : Well, she was frozie-wozen to the bone, so we helped her out!
8319 : The Elvaan was in too much of a hurry to wait for us to revive the girl, and headed off to the north by himself. Not very considerate, if you ask me!
8320 : That little girl was in bad shape. By the time we got to her, she was as hard as ice. You could use her crikey-spiky hair as nails! I know, because I tried!
8321 : To make sure she didn't croak, we sent her back to Windurst, a la Warp II!
8322 : Guess what? The guy that brought the girl to us--I saw him asking some adventurers to take him to Bastok! He said he was looking for his companions and that it was urgent!
8323 : I wonder why he lied to Torino and said that he was going to travel north. My mommy-wommy told me that only thieves and criminals lie...
8324 : That Louverance fellow. This wasn't the first time we'd seen him. He's been around here before, pokey-woking his needly nose into our busy-bodied business.
8325 : I think Potete has the hots for him, but that's probably just because she's looking for something to keep her warm up here in the freezing-wheezing cold.
8326 : Huh? You wantaru know more about this tower?
8327 : This place is called the ruins of Pso'Xja. They're the mirror-wirror image of the Horutoto Ruins in Sarutabaruta.
8328 : But with all the tricksy traps inside, I'd prefer to stay out here in the freezy-wheezing cold.
8329 : So you sprintarued down here to pokey-wokey your nose into Pso'Xja as soon as you heard it was opened up to adventurers?
8330 : Not that I think you'll get that far, but beware of the big gate in the deepestaru section of the ruins.
8331 : We were warned by the guiding star that led us to Windurst to never ever mess aboutaru with the ruins of Pso'Xja.
8332 : Hm? Why don'taru we investigate the ruins of Pso'Xja?
8333 : The Tenshodo had this place locked up tightaru for decades. There're probably oodles and oodles of oddities for us to research down there.
8334 : But our history books tell us that we shouldn'taru go near the...well, the same thing that's in the Horutoto Ruins.
8335 : Anyway, that's what our ancestors wrote. And if you can't trustaru your ancestors, who can you trustaru?
8336 : What do you mean, you can'taru find that Mithra?
8337 : You would think someone wearing that much black would be easy to find in all this white...
8338 : Waitaru! A helmed figure approaches!
8339 : Leigon-Moigon, you also vear a helmet, remember?
8340 : I have discovered vhere that sin hunter vas heading. This is going to be trickier than ve thought.
8341 : The Mithra vas looking for a frozen lake that exists somevhere in the Uleguerand Range...
8342 : Whoa! Even we Rhinostery adventurers have never set foot in that place!
8343 : Justaru getting through to Xarcabard is crazy-wazy enough! Traveling beyond that is absolutaru madness!
8344 : The Rhinostery's research vill take us there eventually. Should ve call Minister Rukususu...?
8345 : Minister Rukususu has been allergic to Mithra ever since that incidentaru with Iru-Kuiru.
8346 : It's not just that. The Rhinostery has been having troubles with Kazham for decades.
8347 : It's only since Jakoh Wahcondalo became chieftainness that things have returned to normal.
8348 : Maybe we should leave this game of cat and mouse to the Mithra.
8349 : This is their faultaru in the first place. That sin hunter forced the Rhinostery to make an irregular tuning fork, after all...
8350 : Researchers from all over the place have complained about their treatmentaru at the paws of that madwoman.
8351 : That's rightaru! And someone should take that helm away from her! She's a black mark on all my helmet-wearing brethren!
8352 : What's that about my helmet, sugarpie?
8353 : Shikaree Y! You're okay!
8354 : So sorry. I seem to have had your little hearts all aflutter.
8355 : I heard the tale from the Mithra in Kazham. Apparently some helmeted Tarutaru was rrrunning around telling everybody I had died.
8356 : (It wasn't me!)
8357 : That tuning fork had never been tested. You're free to risk your life in any vay you see fit, but I vill not have the Rhinostery blamed for your death.
8358 : You know, I was never able to use it.
8359 : Vhat!?
8360 : (It wasn't our fault!)
8361 : It vas defective?
8362 : No, nothing like that. It had nothing to do with the protocrystal.
8363 : Some power prrrevented me from reaching the lake.
8364 : No, nothing like that.  The crystal of darkness was shattered.
8365 : Who would've thought things would turn out like this...
8366 : And your questions for the sleeping gods?
8367 : Broken...!? Then vhat of the sleeping gods!?
8368 : Surely you've figured it out, pumpkin? I wasn't able to meet them.
8369 : I followed your trail to Norg where I heard some fascinating news.
8370 : The old guy must've told you that someone was asking about magicite...
8371 : This person has been making all sorts of inquiries in Norg and the Tenshodo. You don't happen to have any details on this, do you?
8372 : Now that you mention it, Kamui started talking about magicite vhen ve asked for the tale of the baptismal vessel.
8373 : I don't know if it's true or not, but rumors say that the stones being collected by the beastmen were called...
8374 : Magicite. Fairly weak versions, as far as my rrresearch goes.
8375 : The stone I am interested in is far stronger and calls to the darkness within you... I am speaking of black magicite.
8376 : And when you mention black magicite, it means you're talking about the Star of Tavnazia.
8377 : ...?
8378 : Oh, bother. I seem to have said too much.
8379 : Why don't you just forget I said anything?  If you feel you can't forget, I'll be happy to beat you until you can't remember a thing.
8380 : !?
8381 : Vhat vas that all about?
8382 : Black magicite? The darkness vithin...?
8383 : %, thank you for assisting me vith my duties. It has been a pleasure. Please take this as compensation for all your hard vork, including the trouble you vent through acquiring the gifts for Kamui.
8384 : Wow!
8385 : Nice!
8386 : You can buy a new helmet with that!
8387 : You three, keep Minister Rukususu safe from harm. I bid you farevell.
8388 : mes1
8389 : Ildy-Goldy is really passionataru about his work. Especially when it comes to Minister Rukususu!
8390 : That Mithra mentioned that a protocrystal had been shattered into itty-bitty pieces. How is that possible?
8391 : If we reportaru this to Minister Rukususu, she'll make us venture-wenture into the Uleguerand Range! Brrr!
8392 : I've been wearing this helmet for so long, I've forgotten what my real face looks like.
8393 : I think the cold up here has frozie-wozen the hinges shut...
8394 : You find nothing out of the ordinary.
8395 : Today is your lucky day!
8396 : You sense that your lucky color may bring you fortune.
8397 : My strength has yet to fully return...
8398 : The light from that mirror... It could only be the blessed radiance...
8399 : I cannot let this minor setback deter me.
8400 : After all, this new material shell of mine should not go to waste. The Mirror of Blighted Gloom shall be mine...
8401 : All I need is a little more time to heal, and then...
8402 : Hm...?
8403 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8404 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8405 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8406 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8407 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8408 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8409 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8410 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8411 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8412 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8413 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8414 : It's him...! The man from Jugner...!
8415 : <Sigh>...
8416 : Not so fast...!
8417 : Not so fast...!
8418 : Not so fast...!
8419 : Hold on there...!
8420 : Not so fast...!
8421 : Not so fast...!
8422 : Not so fast...!
8423 : Wait!
8424 : Wait!
8425 : Hey! You!
8426 : Hold on there...!
8427 : Not so fast...!
8428 : What do you ask of me...?
8429 : I want you to examine this mirror.
8430 : I want you to take a look at this mirror.
8431 : I want you to look at this mirror.
8432 : I wish for you to examine this mirror.
8433 : I want you to look at this mirror.
8434 : I want you to examine this mirror.
8435 : I want you to examine this mirror.
8436 : Could you take a look at this mirror?
8437 : I want you to look at this mirror.
8438 : Can you take a look at this mirror?
8439 : I wish for you to examine this mirror.
8440 : I want you to examine this mirror.
8441 : Hmm...
8442 : This glass has led me towards that which I sought. For the longest time now...
8443 : This glass has led me towards whatever I was looking for. For the longest time now...
8444 : This glass has led me towards that which I sought. For the longest time now...

8491 : You are the guardian of this mirror. There must be something you can do.
8492 : You're the guardian of this mirror, right? There must be something you can do.
8493 : You are the guardian of this mirror. Is there some way you can fix it?.
8494 : You are the guardian of this mirror. There must be something you can do.
8495 : You're supposed to be the mirror's guardian, right? Isn't there something you can do?
8496 : You are the guardian of this mirror. There has to be something you can do.
8497 : You are the guardian of this mirror. There must be something you can do.
8498 : You're the guardian of this mirror, after all. Can you do something?
8499 : You are the guardian of this mirror. There must be something you can do.
8500 : You're the guardian of this mirror, right? You must know some neat trick to fix it.
8501 : You are the guardian of this mirror. There must be something you can do.

11812 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11813 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
11814 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
11815 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
11816 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
11817 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
11818 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
11819 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
11820 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
11821 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
11822 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
11823 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
11824 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
11825 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
11826 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
11827 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
11828 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
11829 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
11830 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
11831 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
11832 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
11833 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
11834 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!

11838 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
11839 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
11840 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
11841 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
11842 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
11843 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
11844 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
11845 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
11846 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
11847 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
11848 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
11849 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
11850 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
11851 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
11853 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
11854 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
11855 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
11856 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
11857 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
11858 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
11859 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
11860 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
11861 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
11862 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
11863 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

11960 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
11961 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11962 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11963 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11964 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11965 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11966 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11967 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11968 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11969 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11970 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11971 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11972 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11973 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11974 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11975 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11976 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11977 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11978 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11979 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11980 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11981 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11982 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11983 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11984 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11985 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11986 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11987 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11988 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11989 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11990 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11991 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11992 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11993 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11994 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11995 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11996 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11997 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11998 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11999 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
12000 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
12001 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
12002 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
12003 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%

12883 : Enough! You shut up already!
12884 : You answer Lord Mukdrom at once!
12885 : That sword can break World Eater Egg?
12886 : I told you... I have important duty! This is my destiny!
12887 : Important? You just smashing egg...
12888 : Not even mighty Lord Mukdrom could break it!
12889 : If Goblin can break open egg, Lord Mukdrom embarrassed!
12890 : Silenceee!
12891 : You smash open World Eater Egg with sword.
12892 : But, ultimate power belong to me... Yes?

12904 : Here goes nothing!
12905 : Th-the egg broke open.
12906 : Come on, guys! Let's get out of here!
12907 : Hm!?
12908 : You... Have we met before?
12909 : How do you reply? I think so. Probably not.
12910 : Anyway!
12911 : We need to get down this cliff quickly!
12912 : So, have we met before somewhere?
12913 : I Gloom Phantom!
12914 : And you are?

12918 : Really? He annihilated his own unit?
12919 : Wait!
12920 : Hang in there, %!
12921 : Such formidable fighting spirit and magical ability...
12922 : Mukdrom! This is to be your final resting place!
12923 : Haaah, haaah...
12924 : Is this is power of the World Eater Egg?
12925 : You were most impressive, %.
12926 : If you had not been here, I would have surely met an ignominious end.
12927 : Hm?
12928 : Is that...
12929 : Argh! That didn't go as I hoped!
12930 : L-let's get outta here...
12931 : That Mukdrom all talk. Egg eat him instead.
12932 : I don't think anyone can withstand egg's contents.
12933 : But, these humans much tougher than expected.

12935 : That human keep staring at us. Let's scram already!
12936 : That sword...
12937 : Wait, we should probably deal with the Orcs atop the cliff first.
12938 : There does not appear to be any signs of life up there...
12939 : It seems that egg had the power to turn them against each other. Or perhaps, it turned him into something else entirely...
12940 : %, I am going to examine the location where the World Eater Egg was located.
12941 : I need you to return to San d'Oria and update Prince Trion on what has transpired here.
12942 : By the time you reach the capital, I imagine the rescue unit sent by Rahal will have also returned with Altennia and the others.
