6975 : [/I've gained a fair amount of experience./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./Hmm./I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level./I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./I've come a long way towards my next level./We've been busy, huh?/I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level.] [/I must be close to halfway to my next level by now./Can't slow down now!/I must be almost halfway to my next level by now./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!/That was much faster than I expected./No time to be slacking off!/Must be close to halfway by now./I think I'm almost halfway to my next level./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!]
6976 : I've gained a fair amount of experience. I must be close to halfway to my next level by now.
6977 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
6978 : Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
6979 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6980 : I think I'm about half way there...
6981 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6982 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6983 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
6984 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
6985 : I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.
6986 : We've been busy, huh? I think I'm almost halfway to my next level.
6987 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6988 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.
6989 : I'm halfway there...maybe?
6990 : [/Hmm./This is a good pace!/Hmm./Well, well./Just a little more./Come on!/I'm past the halfway point./Just a little more!/Well, well.] [/Not too much further to my next level./Not much more to my next level!/Still need a little more experience for my next level./It appears my next level is not far off at all./My next level is not too far away./I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!/Not long now until I gain another level./My next level is almost within sight!/It appears my next level is not far off at all.]
6991 : Hmm. Not too much further to my next level.
6992 : This is a good pace! Not much more to my next level!
6993 : Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
6994 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6995 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
6996 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
6997 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
6998 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
6999 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
7000 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
7001 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
7002 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7003 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
7004 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?
7005 : [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
7006 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
7007 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
7008 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
7009 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7010 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
7011 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7012 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7013 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7014 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7015 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7016 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7017 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7018 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7019 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7020 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7021 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7022 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7023 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7024 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7025 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7026 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7027 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7028 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7029 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7030 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7031 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7032 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7033 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7034 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7035 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7036 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7037 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7038 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7039 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7040 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7041 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7042 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7043 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7044 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7045 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7046 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7047 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7048 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7049 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7050 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7051 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7052 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7053 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7054 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7055 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7056 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7057 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7058 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7059 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7060 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7061 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7062 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7109 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7110 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7111 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7112 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7113 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7114 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7115 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7116 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7117 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7118 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7119 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7120 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7121 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7122 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7123 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7124 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7125 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7126 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7127 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7128 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7129 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7130 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7131 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7132 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7368 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7369 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7370 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7371 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7372 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7373 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.

7379 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7380 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7381 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7382 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7383 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7384 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7385 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7386 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7387 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7388 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7389 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7390 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7391 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.

7441 : I approached, and found this cave. I soon discovered that the water from a nearby cactus helped reduce my fever. As I recovered, I decided to name my saviors.

7464 : If you still want one, it will cost you # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
7465 : Do you wish to rent a chocobo? Yes, I do. No, thank you.

7534 : You! What are you doing here?
7535 : Calm down, Ayame. [He's/She's] an adventurer. It's [his/her] job to go adventuring.
7536 : We're here to investigate something. It could get pretty dangerous, so I suggest taking a few steps back if you know what's good for you.
7537 : Why, Cid. What business do you have here today?
7538 : Well, if it isn't little Wolfgang. How have you been?
7539 : We're here to check out the Crystal Line. Recently I've been receiving some very strange readings from this area.
7540 : According to the data retrieved by a Republican party that visited here last month, the once stable energy flow has begun to fluctuate.
7541 : I've never seen such high readings...
7542 : The flow of energy is so overwhelming that the Telepoint you see over there was shattered to pieces! And now there are reports that a giant beast appeared over the sea, just to the north of Delkfutt's Tower.
7543 : I have a bad feeling that these two events are connected, and that they're warning us of something worse to come.
7544 : ... I understand that research inclines you to pursue these matters. However, I ask that you leave the investigation to the Duchy.
7545 : Eh? So the Duchy knows the cause of all these strange phenomena?
7546 : Not exactly. We have numerous parties investigating the situation. However, many of those sent into the field have...vanished.
7547 : We cannot allow any more accidents. The damage to Vana'diel would be great if we were to lose such an important engineer as you, Cid.
7548 : Hah!  Let me guess... The scientists back in Jeuno told you to get rid of all those who got in their way.
7549 : Who do they think they are!? Come to think of it, I have good reason to believe that it's those lunatics that are causing all this trouble!

7717 : Lookin' for cards in all the wrong places.

7754 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
7755 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
7756 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.

7758 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
7759 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
7760 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
7761 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
7762 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
7763 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
7764 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
7765 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7766 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
7767 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7768 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
7769 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7770 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
7771 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
7772 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
7773 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
7774 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
7775 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
7776 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
7777 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!

10889 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
10890 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
10891 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
10892 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
10893 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
10894 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
10895 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
10896 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
10897 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
10898 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
10899 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
10900 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
10901 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
10902 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
10903 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
10904 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
10905 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
10906 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
10907 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
10908 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
10909 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
10910 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
10911 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!
10912 : Choose a location: West Ronfaure. East Ronfaure. La Theine Plateau. Valkurm Dunes. Jugner Forest. Batallia Downs. North Gustaberg. South Gustaberg. Konschtat Highlands. Pashhow Marshlands.

10914 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there, kupo!
10915 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
10916 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
10917 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
10918 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
10919 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
10920 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
10921 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
10922 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
10923 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
10924 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
10925 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
10926 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
10927 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
10928 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
10930 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
10931 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
10932 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
10933 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
10934 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
10935 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
10936 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
10937 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
10938 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
10939 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
10940 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

10959 : Hi there! I'm  your friendly neighborhood smile sergeant! I'm in charge of running the [beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.
10960 : I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too! You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?
10961 : What will you do? Undertake training. Hear an explanation. What's the qualifying time? What's the fastest time? Nothing.
10962 : Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don't have %. Well, that's just too bad!
10963 : It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem! The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!
10964 : The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.
10965 : But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree. The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!
10966 : Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!
10967 : With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da! Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.
10968 : The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor! When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. Smile helpers are posted at each, so you can't miss them!
10969 : Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage. The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?
10970 : I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.
10971 : Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!
10972 : What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!
10973 : Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!
10974 : One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled. But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?
10975 : So far, the fastest time in this area is # minute[/s] # second[/s]. Wow! And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is %. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?
10976 : We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within # minute[/s] # second[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young [wolf/vixen] like you, surely! And if you manage a time quicker than # minute[/s] # second[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?
10977 : Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad... But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!
10978 : At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of # gil from each participant. All proceeds go towards presents for the children. Oh, won't you think of the children? <Sniffle>...
10979 : Give to the children? I live to give! Charity begins at home.
10980 : But of course! First, I'll need you to lend me your %... Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!
10981 : You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated. Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?
10982 : There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you. If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>
10983 : So, are you ready-steady? [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO! Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!
10984 : Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.
10985 : But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!
10986 : Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness. Let's start from the top, shall we?
10987 : Oh, what're you doing here? Aren't you in the middle of a run right now? Couldn't stand to be parted from your favorite smile sergeant, maybe? Teehee!
10988 : What will you do? Hear an explanation. Where're the smile helpers again? Cancel the training. Nothing.
10989 : Awww... These rivulets of tears streaming down my face... B-but it's okay... You have your own reasons for quitting, and I understand... <Sob>
10990 : Welcome back! Let's check your time, shall we? You cleared the course in # minute[/s] # second[/s].
10991 : Oh my Goddess! You've set a new record for this area! Hooray! Somebody, break out the fireworks!
10992 : You've successfully qualified! Yay! Here's a little something to commemorate this marvelous achievement.
10993 : You obtain %!
10994 : Ah, just the knowledge that there're capable adventurers like you around helps me sleep better at night. The children...they're in good hands... <Sob>
10995 : You did just fine, but don't be resting on those laurels, you hear? As we smilebringers say, there's always a bigger, brighter smile to be had!
10996 : Oh no! I'm afraid your time falls short of qualification! As much as I want to give you a passing grade, headquarters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
10997 : Oh no! Please don't be mad, but...I forgot to record your time. I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this scatterbrain of a smile sergeant...
10998 : It might surprise you to learn this, but even the toughest--grrrrrr!--and roughest of us smilebringers need rest and relaxation. Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!
10999 : Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, work hard, play hard is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too. After you complete a run with a qualifying time--yay!--you're required to rest up until the next day (Vana'diel time).
11000 : Awww, seeing the way you're simply bursting with enthusiasm makes me want to cry tears of joy. But you have to be cruel to be kind. No more training until tomorrow, young [man/lady]! No siree!

11041 : Let me takey-wake a stab. You're %, right?
11042 : Boy, am I pleased to meet you! I'm Kocchi-Arocchi, and I am out of this world...literally!
11043 : I see you've broughtaru your % with you.
11044 : The cavernous-wavernous maw here's connected to Abyssea's take on the Tahrongi Canyon...and it's not proving to be a popular interpretation, I might add.
11045 : Call me lowbrow, but I much prefer the canyon you've got here. But enough aboutaru myself. I know that you've a mind to see with your own eyes the horrors that lie yonder.
11046 : I won't stop you from making the journey-wourney. But I am obliged to send you off with a warning: Your destination is fraughtaru with danger. Woooooo!
11047 : Okay, now that due warning has been given, I'm going to make an earnest plea for help: Help!
11048 : Ahem! To elaborate, a greataru cataclysm has befallen Abyssea. The blessing of the moon and the stars no longer reachy-weach us, and the boundary between worlds grows more unstable by the day.
11049 : The situation has deteriorated to the pointaru where nothing surprises me anymore. If a dhalmel pie were to appear out of thin air, for instance, I'd be full, but hardly surprised. But I digress-wigress...
11050 : Where was I again? Oh, right. What I was about to say was, we're being plagued by a giantaru worm. A giantaru worm, I said!
11051 : What's the big deal, man? It's only a squishy-wishy worm, you say? To that I retortaru, these worms should've been extinct since the Great War! What's more, this one's suspected of destabilizing the said boundary between worlds!
11052 : Vanquishing this pesti-westilence has become the top priority of us survivors. And by association, it's now your priority also!
11053 : No one knows whether eliminataruing the creature would do any good, but what else are we to do?
11054 : Oh, before I forgetaru, there's something I want you to have.
11055 : It's called cruor. Don't you just love the way its deep, red hue is reminiscent of freshly drawn blood?
11056 : It's the currency in circu-wirculation in Abyssea. As I can no longer return home, I've no more use for it. Consider it a send-off giftaru for my [hero/heroine] who's about to head into grave danger!
11057 : Remember, %! You mustaru...fulfill...my destiny! Woooooo!
11058 : Ah, %! I was wondering when you'd come backy-wack.
11059 : I knew you were high caliber--what with your big, bulging muscles and all--but that you would really-weally finish off that giant worm! Amazing! My only regretaru, though, is not having been there to land the killing blow... <Sigh>...
11060 : But that's beside the point. The important thing is a glimmer-wimmer of hope has been restored to the resistance! From the bottomless chasm of my heart, thank you!
11061 : I wantaru you to have this. It's just this little guy's small way of showing his appreciation.
11062 : It's %, and it works like a charm in the hands of a person-werson of your world. No doubtaru it'll come in handy.
11063 : Remember-wember what I said earlier, %? No, not the part about fulfilling my destiny, but the destabilizing boundary between worlds.
11064 : This wariness inside me defies words, but I have a terrible-werrible foreboding. Laugh at me all you want for a fretting fool, but I intend to stay on my toes...and I suggestaru you do the same.
11065 : Not that a grizzle-wizzled veteran like you needs reminding, but do be careful, alright?
11066 : You are too far away to participate in the Voidwatch operation.

11114 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
11115 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
11116 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
11117 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11118 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11119 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11120 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11121 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11122 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11123 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11124 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11125 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11126 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11127 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11128 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11129 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11130 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11131 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11132 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11133 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11134 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11135 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11136 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11137 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11138 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11139 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11140 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11141 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11142 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11143 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11144 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11145 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11146 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11147 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11148 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11149 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11150 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11151 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11152 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11153 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11154 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11155 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11156 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11157 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11158 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
11159 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%

11994 : Am I still dreaming? Or can it really be...?
11995 : Lately, I've seen the strangest visions...
11996 : As I waited for you here, this crystal--it spoke to me...and I fell into a trance.
11997 : It was but another vision.
11998 : People fled to the four corners of Vana'diel, futilely trying to escape an ever-growing cloud of darkness.
11999 : And there I stood, frozen, my legs unable to do so much as quiver.
12000 : The mothercrystal's vision can't be simple happenstance.
12001 : Not everyone is aware that our world--our Vana'diel--is protected by the benevolence of the mothercrystal.
12002 : Look all around you. This place is no accident.
12003 : The technologies required to make these structures are beyond any known to us.
12004 : Those who came before doubtlessly created this facility to shelter the crystal from harm.
12005 : But I wonder...
12006 : There's some reason why the same visions continue to float before my eyes.
12007 : So I came here, to the mothercrystal.
12008 : Our world has remained resilient thanks to mothercrystals' blessings.
12009 : But what if it is our turn to protect her?
12010 : In my dream, an infernal gloom obscured the mothercrystal from view.
12011 : This mothercrystal isn't the only one, of course, and I've no way of knowing if I'm even at the right one...
12012 : Wait--does that mean you've seen the same vision?
12013 : ...I see. Then this Iroha came from a future where much the same thing has happened.
12014 : Then the beastmen that ravage the three nations are not to blame. So... So what is this Emptiness?
12015 : She might be the only one with the answers I seek.
12016 : Where could we run into her again?
12017 : Giving up isn't in my vocabulary, yet we've no choice but to hold off for now.
12018 : In the meantime, I'd like you to go to the place I saw in my dream. I'd go myself, but....
12019 : In the meantime, I'd like you to go to the place I saw in my dream.
12020 : How about it? I'll go. I can't right now. Uh...go where, exactly?
12021 : If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours...but I can't force you.
12022 : Thank you. I'm pretty sure the place I saw was somewhere near Jeuno.
12023 : I'm pretty sure the place I saw was somewhere near Jeuno.
12024 : Where did the vision take place? Lower Jeuno. Delkfutt's Tower. Qufim Island.
12025 : Do you think? I'm not so sure...
12026 : That's it! It's so clear to me now!
12027 : I wish I could go with you, but know that I'm there in spirit.
12028 : It doesn't take a soothsayer to know that darkness bodes ill. Stay safe.
12029 : I'll be there, %.
12030 : Master! Look--Lady Lion!
12031 : Master!
12032 : Lion? Lion!?
12033 : I...saw it again...
12034 : %, that special orb you have is a relic from the future.
12035 : Maybe that explains the visions I've been having.
12036 : If what it portends is true, then there is nothing we can do to stop the darkness from approaching.
12037 : But %, I saw nothing about whether or not you were there to try to stop it.
12038 : What if there is no one to stand up for Vana'diel? Will it perish with but a whimper?
12039 : Lion, perhaps it is because the orb is not yet fully illuminated.
12040 : I agree. Yet we learned about the coming darkness before the light could fully arrive...likely ushering it in before we were ready.
12041 : I know not what the two of you are on about, so I will ask one simple question: what can we do?
12042 : %, another image that floated before my eyes was one of you vanquishing the Shadow Lord.
12043 : The Shadow Lord!?
12044 : And the crystal spoke to you when you did.
12045 : Then it all falls into place.
12046 : You must stand steadfast against the lord of the beastmen in order to set history upon its proper course.
12047 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats--not just this one--and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12048 : Master, you must take your first steps along that path.
12049 : ...Stop the Shadow Lord.
12050 : %, there are many paths that lie before you.
12051 : They opened up the moment you banished the Shadow Lord from our realm.
12052 : My dream showed me many nations, many worlds...and you were there in each one, bringing succor to those who cried out.
12053 : Then it all falls into place.
12054 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats--not just that one--and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12055 : Master, you must bring history back to its natural state.
12056 : ...And time is not exactly on our side...
12057 : %, your journeys have taken you to the far corners of our realm.
12058 : The reckoning is at hand, quicker than any of us could have prepared for.
12059 : Then it all falls into place.
12060 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12061 : And [his/her] legend has already been forged.
12062 : Then we may be out of time...
12063 : And now you know everything that I do.
12064 : I'll be with you every step of your journey to conquer the Shadow Lord.
12065 : I'll do everything in my power to help you.
12066 : What the...
12067 : Lady Lion, allow me to express my gratitude.
12068 : Your honesty and strength of spirit has taken physical form.
12069 : And...you can use it?
12070 : Then you're quite welcome.
12071 : In the meantime, I'll continue my search for information about the Shadow Lord.
12072 : In the meantime, I'll continue my search for information about Escha.
12073 : Zeid, what do you plan on doing?
12074 : Gilgamesh has asked me to report back as soon as I know something, so my first order of business is to return to Norg.
12075 : Lion and Zeid, your assistance has been invaluable.
12076 : Master, I intend to learn all I can about that bell.
12077 : I await good news about the Shadow Lord's defeat.
12078 : Perhaps you should head back to Norg as well.
12079 : Until then.
12080 : The resonance between the % and the crystal reaches a crescendo!
12081 : The celestial capital of Al'Taieu welcomes you.
12082 : Would that it would do so with open arms, but the vortex slowly eats away at my home.
12083 : The capital is not the only thing to succumb. I, too, feel my energy beginning to fade.
12084 : You are eminently aware that I am not supposed to be present in this haven.
12085 : The void is compressing time, and things that once remained separate are starting to collide.
12086 : Perhaps it might be easiest to think of me as a wandering spirit.
12087 : No, you needn't offer me any explanation.
12088 : I have already heard that Siren's benevolence has guided you here.
12089 : You and Iroha have sought guidance from companions all throughout Vana'diel in order to stop the encroaching darkness.
12090 : In Iroha's future was an event called the Reckoning in which you made a decision that rang throughout the land.
12091 : As a result, Iroha was left alone, confined to Reisenjima.
12092 : A future in which Iroha was the only child of Altana left in Vana'diel.
12093 : And so you wish to beseech Altana herself for guidance...for any hint on how this bleak future can be altered.
12094 : Al'Taieu is oft referred to as the celestial capital because it has a stronger connection with Altana than anywhere on the ground below.
12095 : And I am able to commune with the terrestrial avatars and pass through the veil separating this world from the next via the crystal. Yet even I do not possess the means to reach Altana herself.
12096 : Even the most powerful forces in the lands, forces that can create whole worlds, cannot approach her.
12097 : Not even Odin.
12098 : No, such a feat requires more than anyone could hope to muster.
12099 : A power so great it could make the five crystals whole once more.
12100 : Yet did the future Siren not mention that a key may yet lie in Reisenjima?
12101 : I find no cause to doubt her, particularly in light of what I have discovered.
12102 : What if we could create a crystal that could banish the Emptiness?
12103 : %, you have traversed the cavernous maws, so I need not remind you that you have visited worlds other than our own.
12104 : These worlds exist in parallel, and each has its own past, present, and future.
12105 : Tartarus, a place known by a select few in Eastern Ulbuka, is one such world.
12106 : Countless years have I spent ensuring balance between these worlds, that they never interfere with each other.
12107 : From each I have drawn but a small fraction of crystal energy...
12108 : ...And have accumulated enough light to create another towering mothercrystal for Vana'diel.
12109 : Inquire about what? Drawing crystal energy. Accumulating light.
12110 : It is precisely as I have said. I have undertaken this plan since long before Iroha arrived here in this era.
12111 : This plan is to create a new crystal in Reisenjima, the holy land of the Far East, and create a safe haven from the darkness. A plan, I add, that requires an inordinate amount of time to bring to fruition.
12112 : Iroha's presence or absence makes no difference.
12113 : The result would be the same.
12114 : %, if what I said overlaps with anything Siren told you, then you may have just found another piece of the puzzle.
12115 : But what this Reckoning that Iroha speaks of is, I know not.
12116 : ...
12117 : You are the Warrior of the Crystal...and are destined to become the Warrior of Light.
12118 : You will coalesce thousands of points of light into a single shining star, your radiance casting out the darkness.
12119 : And you will become more than a mere Warrior.
12120 : Master, all the grand adventures you have embarked on led you here.
12121 : You have guided us all to the final struggle against an unthinkable future.
12122 : Vanquish the darkness that lies within you!
12123 : You have already banished the darkness that lies within you, and have but to fill yourself with sacred light.
12124 : Even in the most trying of times, there is one virtue that humanity does not abandon: hope.
12125 : It is your calling to keep that hope alive.
12126 : Iroha is the only one who can aid you in making your final decision.
12127 : And there is one more thing.
12128 : I would have you aid me should you feel that my plan is the proper course of action.
12129 : All I have worked to collect these many years is slowly being absorbed into the world known as Tartarus.
12130 : One born of that land has caught wind of my plan and seeks to undermine it.
12131 : Seek out the one whose dominion over magic is absolute...
12132 : Please...I beg you...
12133 : Ah, Master. Excellent timing.
12134 : Come! To the world of the gods!
12135 : Meet...Altana...
12136 : Teleport to where? Al'Taieu. The Empyreal Paradox. Nowhere.
12137 : Teleport to where? Al'Taieu. Reisenjima. Nowhere.
