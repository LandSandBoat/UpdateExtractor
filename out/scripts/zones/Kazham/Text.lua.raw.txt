9961 : The highest level is #!
9962 : Scrrram if you don't want your eyes clawed out. This is no place for outsiderrrs.
9963 : Move along. Move along. I don't care if you are an adventurerrr. We don't give special trrreatment to anyone.
9964 : Stop right there! What business do you have with the chieftainness?
9965 : It had better be good, or you won't be seeing the light of tomorrow.
9966 : I am Jakoh Wahcondalo, the Chieftainness of Kazham. This is my village. We have only one rrrule here--I make the rrrules.
9967 : Hah-hah-hah! So Gilgamesh is asking me to let you pass through to the Temple of Uggalepih, is he? That old dog hasn't changed a bit.
9968 : Have you never hearrrd the tales of Uggalepih? Do you even know what you'll be getting yourself into?
9969 : Well, don't say I didn't warn you.
9970 : Here, take this key. It opens the door that leads to the deeper parrrts of the temple. Have fun! Hah-hah-hah!
9971 : You don't know the way to the temple? It's just to the southeast of here. But that's all the help I can give you. I'm not rrrisking my, or any of my guards', tails.
9972 : No, no, no. I can't let you through here. Authorized perrrsonnel only.
9973 : We can deliver packages to Mog Houses anywhere in Vana'diel.
9974 : You headed to the Yuhtunga Jungle? On the east side there's a volcano. Inside that volcano is Ifrit's Cauldron. I wouldn't rrrecommend any sightseeing tours. Those places are pretty nasty.
9975 : Also, on the far southeastern side of this island is an ancient, rrrundown temple. Not many live to see it, though. The jungles here are teeming with vicious beasts...
9976 : So what is all this talk about anotherrr Great Warrr over in the continents?
9977 : You just watch. When the flames of battle start raging, it will be the Mithra who save everyone's tails.
9978 : A lot of the young ones these days leave Kazham for the mainland cities...
9979 : That is fine...as long as they rrrealize that once they step outside the city gates, they won't be welcomed back.
9980 : If you walk far enough southeast, you'll come by a set of ruins known as the Temple of Uggalepih.
9981 : A lot of lighthearrrted travelers journey there to see the sights, but not all of them come back in one piece...
9982 : A while back, therrre was talk about sending a party to the Temple of Uggalepih to fight the Tonberries. That place is theirrr stronghold, you know.
9983 : However, the chieftainness wouldn't let them use herrr temple key, and that was the end of that.
9984 : You won't find me heading to any new lands or bowing to any new chieftainness.
9985 : What good is a chieftainness that won't fight? Mithra should only follow a leader who won't back down frrrom a fight.
9986 : This counter is for departurrres only. The arrivals counter is on the otherrr side.
9987 : The prrrice for an airship ride to Jeuno is # gil.
9988 : Board the airship? Yes. Not yet.
9989 : You don't have enough gil.
9990 : Sorry, but you'll need % to boarrrd.
9991 : You want to enter Kazham? Look at the sign, buddy. This is the departures gate. The arrivals gate is on the other side.
9992 : Pay your boarding fee to Bhoyu Halpatacco at the counter there.
9993 : Hello? Where do you think you're going?
9994 : The departures counter is on the other side. And don't forget to pay Bhoyu Halpatacco on your way in.
9995 : Welcome to Kazham--a lush tropical paradise!
9996 : Enter Kazham? Yes. Not yet.
9997 : Hey! Don't take one more step. You're not going anywhere until you get checked by Dakha Topsalwan.
9998 : You can't come in here! This is the airship arrivals gate.
9999 : If you are ready to depart Kazham, pay the boarding fee at the counter on the other side.
10000 : We always welcome adventurers to Kazham! You are like new seeds, carried in by the warrrm sea breeze.
10001 : We hope that your dreams grrrow under our shining sun.
10002 : Have you ever been to Windurrrst? A tribe of Mithrrra that left Kazham long ago is living there.
10003 : All the aggressive ones left, while most of the laid-back ones stayed. That's why Kazham is so peaceful.
10004 : You're one of those [people/people/people/people/people/people/people/Mithra/people] borrrn over in the mainlands.
10005 : You may think that we Mithra all wanderrr around, never settling down in one place, but you're wrong. Spend a little time here, and you'll see our true colors.
10006 : Hey therrre, adventurer! Have you got your fill of Kazham?
10007 : What about that volcano to the east of herrre? Bet you haven't been therrre yet, have you?
10008 : What's wrrrong, young adventurer? You look like you've got something on your mind.
10009 : Whenever something's trrroubling me, I sit back and relax in the Kazham sun, and everything is fine.
10010 : ...
10011 : ...
10012 : A familiarrr scent clings to you, adventurer. The aroma of rich earth, and a fresh breeze...it brings me back to long ago.
10013 : ...But these are merely the rrramblings of one whose days in the sun have long since passed. Be safe in your travels, adventurer.
10014 : Now that routes to the Outlands have been opened, gobs and gobs of adventurers have been running in and out of Kazham.
10015 : We thought that we researchers from the Rhinostery could help-ity out those new to Elshimo.
10016 : It looks like Perih Vashai, Master of the Azure Bow, has become chieftainness of the trrribe in Windurst.
10017 : I heard that she got that position for catching sinnerrrs that had escaped from Kazham during the Grrreat War.
10018 : You've heard of the Tonberries, rrright? They may look small, but they pack a punch...and they keep coming back for morrre, no matter how many you take out!
10019 : When you're outside the town gates, you should watch your back...those guys will stab you in it!
10020 : We Mithra are bound to this land. We listen to its cries, protect it, and rrrespect it.
10021 : When a group changes where it lives, the lives of that group change with it, but the ties with the land do not.
10022 : Adventurer, are you? Well, why don't you trrry your luck in Ifrit's Cauldron?
10023 : You can't say you've been to Yuhtunga unless you've seen the volcano!
10024 : Wow! You say you got here by airship? Prrretty good for an adventurer!
10025 : Someday I'd like to trrravel around Vana'diel on one of those flying ships. Thanks to the chieftainness, it's easier to travel outside of Kazham these days.
10026 : Hey, you! Did you brrring anything interesting from the mainland?
10027 : Nothing? What kind of an adventurerrr are you? The other day, this Hume from Bastok showed us the coolest thing! Afterrr that, he was the most popular guy in town!
10028 : Whenever I hearrr the sound of the ocean, I always think it sounds like someone calling sleep, sleep. Can you hearrr it too, [misterrr/lady]?
10029 : You shouldn't fight it when you do. It's best to just lie down and...<yawn>...
10030 : Hey, you're an adventurer, arrren't you? I wouldn't want you to get lost. Let me give you a little help.
10031 : The jungle rrright outside the village gates is the Yuhtunga Jungle. To the south of the Yuhtunga Jungle is the Yhoator Jungle. Did you get all that?
10032 : This is just a rrrumor, but I heard that the chieftainness has the hots for some old Hume guy.
10033 : I can't see why any Mithra would go for a Hume guy. What's good about a guy that can't even pick up the scent of his prrrey?
10034 : When it comes to knife-throwing, there isn't a soul that can match the skill of our chieftainness. I advise staying on herrr good side.
10035 : Nothing in this world is crrreated good or evil. However, evil can arrrise when something exists in a place where it did not originally belong.
10036 : To rrreturn these things to the place where they belong, we must often rrreceive help from the hand of nature. This is also true when currring disease and healing wounds.
10037 : Things meant to live will live. Things meant to die will die when their time has come. However, this does not mean you should cease your strrruggle for life.
10038 : Kazham is protected by the guardian of the volcano located east of herrre. With his laughter and anger, the guardian shakes the earth and grants us the strrrength to survive.
10039 : To show our thanks every day, we take the guardian offerings of our best crops. This is how it has been for hundreds of yearrrs.
10040 : It doesn't look like you're doing much more than being in the way. How about taking a trip to the volcano and showing your face to our guarrrdian?
10041 : If you're lucky, you might even hear his rrroar! Hah-hah-hah!
10042 : So, are you going to make yourself useful? Count me in. I'm busy.
10043 : That's the spirit. Today's offering is %.
10044 : What? Did you think I was going to provide you one for frrree? What good is an offering of thanks if it isn't YOU who's showing the thanks?
10045 : Now listen up. Enter the volcano and journey up to the crrrater. There you will find an altar that we made.
10046 : After you've placed the % on the altar, you must shout your name into the crater so the guardian of our land can hearrr.
10047 : Oh, and you should probably take a couple % with you. You never know when you will need them.
10048 : Well, if that's the case, why don't you just take the next airship and get off of our island?
10049 : Travel east to the towerrring volcano. Walk up to the crater and place % on the altar therrre. Oh, and don't forget to shout your name.
10050 : And shout it like you mean it. If your voice is heard by our guarrrdian, then your stay on our island should be a safe one.
10051 : Oh, so you're going to grrreet the guardian of this island? Well, you're going to need some % to get up the volcano.
10052 : Once you've made the offering and been accepted by our guardian, you will be one of us. That is, if you come back alive.
10053 : Oh, you made it back in one piece! You look a lot tougher now than you did beforrre you left.
10054 : We Mithra like our [men/women] strong and brave like you. Here, take this.
10055 : No matter who or what you are, without strength, you'll make no impression on this worrrld.
10056 : The guardian has hearrrd your voice and accepted you. You're now one of us!
10057 : Enjoy the rest of your stay in our lush paradise of Kazham!
10058 : Hey! You here on business? Pleasure? How about a nice souvenirrr before you go back home?
10059 : Can you really get everything that you want on the mainland?
10060 : Can't, can you? Everything you want is rrright here!
10061 : When you die, you can't take anything with you, but what fun is life if you don't have anything to live it up with?
10062 : Sometimes a strrrange Hume comes from the south to buy stuff. I wonder what he's doing down there...
10063 : You don't want to get whipped by those Tonberries, do you? Well, have I got the equipment forrr you!
10064 : Tough armor, strrrong weapons, food, supplies...it's tough getting all those items rrready before setting out on an adventure.
10065 : I rrreally want to go on Chieftainness Jakoh Wahcondalo's Pilgrimage of Flames. However, without the prrroper equipment, I don't think I could make the trip all the way up to the peak of Ifrit's Cauldron.
10066 : When we Mithra establish a new settlement, we call forth the powerrr of the guardian of that land, and craft a special bow.
10067 : That bow is kept by the chieftainness as a symbol of the bond between us and the land we have chosen. The Thalassa Bow that Jakoh Wahcondalo carries is Kazham's bond with Elshimo.
10068 : Ah, I love how my blades shine when wielded in the moonlight.
10069 : And not just shine...my daggerrrs cut so well that even the chieftainness asked me forrr one...no, two!
10070 : Wait a minute. You wouldn't happen to be one of those adventurerrrs from the mainlands, would you?
10071 : I heard that if the prrrice was right, your type would go anywhere, do anything. So, [Mister/Miss] Adventurerrr, are your serrrvices for hire?
10072 : Listen to her offer? Yes. No.
10073 : I guess my eyes deceived me. I was sure you were an adventurerrr.
10074 : Wonderful. My eyes didn't deceive me. Now, have you ever heard of %? This rare wood does not even burn when thrown into the inferrrno of Ifrit's Cauldron.
10075 : Deep in the hearrrt of the Yuhtunga Jungle, there is a giant tree known by the natives as the Firebloom Tree. It is protected day and night by mighty flames, though it never burns.
10076 : The wood taken from the most heavily protected arrrea of the Firebloom Tree is called %.
10077 : To find out which arrrea of the trrree is the most heavily protected, you must first retrieve four vines from its four sides. Then you must take those four vines to a place in Ifrit's Cauldron where firrre spits up from the rrrocks.
10078 : Throw the four vines into the flames. The one that remains unburned is from the most heavily protected side of the Firebloom Tree. Finally, return to the jungle, cut off %, and bring it back here to me.
10079 : Travel to the hearrrt of the Yuhtunga Jungle and cut four vines from the Firebloom Tree.
10080 : Take those four vines to Ifrit's Cauldron and throw them into the walls of fire that rise from the rocks.
10081 : When you have learned the most heavily protected side of the Firebloom Tree, return to it and cut off %. Bring that wood back here to me.
10082 : Look at it! Isn't it beautiful?
10083 : Only a bow made from this wood can stand the blazing heat of Purgatory Arrows.
10084 : By the way, have your trrravels ever taken you to Windurst?
10085 : The chieftainness of that trrribe, Perih Vashai, carries with her a weapon known as the Azure Bow.
10086 : There are many a song that tell of her ability to wield Purgatory Arrows. However, I have heard that her skills have faded since the Great War.
10087 : Wait, [sir/ma'am]. Would you have the time to retrieve another piece of %?
10088 : If you're busy...
10089 : What the...
10090 : Unbelievable! What the hell are those mainlanders thinking?
10091 : Hold on there. You're from the mainlands. You wouldn't happen to know a Hume named Angelica, would you?
10092 : Do you know an Angelica? Of course. Never heard of her.
10093 : Well, who the hell does she think she is? The other day, she sent this letter to the chieftainness.
10094 : Well, aren't you lucky. The other day, this Angelica sent a letter to the chieftainness.
10095 : You won't believe what it was about. Listen. I'll rrread it for you.
10096 : Dear Chieftainness, My name is Angelica, and I'm the best artist here in Windurst. This may seem sudden, but I have a favor to ask. The other day, I heard an adventurer talking about her journey to the Temple of Uggalepih.
10097 : She said she came across a rrroom that resembled an art gallery. The walls were covered with numerous frames, but in these frames there were no paintings.
10098 : Ever since I picked up my first brush, I have dreamed of having my works put on display at a private exhibition. After hearing this adventurer's words, I feel that this may be my chance.
10099 : Chieftainness, you've got to let me display my works in the Temple of Uggalepih's gallery. I'll even pay you, if that's what you want.
10100 : This girl has got to be either crazy or stupid. I wonder if that adventurer actually told her what kind of place the temple rrreally is?
10101 : You. Come over here. If you are traveling in Windurst, I'd like you to deliver this letter to a Hume by the name of Angelica.
10102 : I explained to her in detail about the dangerrrs of Uggalepih. Not that I expect her to listen...
10103 : Those Humes... I haven't been this surprised since the former chieftainness...
10104 : But that's nothing for you to worry about! Now hurry off and deliver that letter to Windurst.
10105 : And tell this Angelica that the Temple of Uggalepih is no place for her fancy mainland modern art.
10106 : Not that I expect her to listen...
10107 : What the...
10108 : Unbelievable! What the hell are those mainlanders thinking?
10109 : Chieftainness! That Angelica looks like she's serious about her crazy plan.
10110 : She wrrrote back saying that she still wants to display her paintings in the temple!
10111 : That letter doesn't look like it was addressed to you... Unless you've changed yourrr name to Jakoh.
10112 : <Hiss> I neverrr gave you perrrmission to rrread my letterrrs! Get over herrre!
10113 : I-I apologize! Ch-Chieftainness! Have mercy! Chieftainness!
10114 : So, even after all we have told her of the dangerrrs of Uggalepih, she still wants to go through with her plan...
10115 : Well, I am not going to spend my time worrying over crazy mainlanders' outrageous schemes.
10116 : You've brought her painting from the mainlands, haven't you? Well, you're free to hang it in the temple, but don't expect any of my women to run in there and save you when you get into trrrouble.
10117 : That's right. You're going to put that painting up. If you don't want to do it, you go back and tell her yourself.
10118 : Now off with you!
10119 : You're on this boat for the long haul, [mister/missy]. You jump off now, you'll be taking down someone's dreams with you.
10120 : But, you stay on too long, and you might sink anyway...
10121 : I get dizzy every time I look at that girl's paintings.
10122 : It's kind of like dreaming while I'm still awake...
10123 : So, did you put the painting in the frame? What? You heard a strange voice and were attacked by a monster!?
10124 : Interrresting... Tell me more.
10125 : ... Long, long ago, an ancient race, now extinct, lived in that temple.
10126 : The voice you heard was probably one of the angrrry spirits of those people.
10127 : I will try explaining this to her in another letter, but I doubt she will listen...
10128 : Oh, and take this. It might have been useless work, but work is work.
10129 : A lot of people say that they hear voices when they travel around the Uggalepih Temple.
10130 : I never heard any, though. I guess I just don't have that sixth sense.
10131 : I will try explaining to Angelica what happened this time in a letter, but I doubt she will listen...
10132 : I would ask you to do it, but after what happened to her painting, I don't think it would be a very good idea if you showed up at her door.
10133 : Hey, listen to this! That Angelica has sent another letter!
10134 : Dear Chieftainness, I thank you for all of your assistance with my private exhibition.
10135 : It looks like some evil spirit is still living in the gallery of the temple. From what I can see, that spirit must have found some flaw in my painting and then rrripped it up.
10136 : But, I'm not giving up! I'm determined to paint a work that is powerful and moving enough to soothe the most evil of spirits!
10137 : Chieftainness, give me one more chance to display my works in the Temple of Uggalepih's gallery. If you need more incentive, I'm rrready to pay any price.
10138 : As I expected... Mainlanders neverrr listen to reason. So, can I count on you to take this painting to the gallery?
10139 : Do you accept the offer? If not me... I've had enough!
10140 : I see... I guess I'll have to find someone a little less busy. Etteh Sulaej! Send a messengerrr to the adventurerrr's inn!
10141 : Understood!
10142 : A glutton for punishment, I see. Take this painting to the gallery. I hope Angelica's painting is better received this time around.
10143 : What? You're going back? And all this for a crazy mainlander... What is going on in you people's heads!?
10144 : Those Humes... I haven't been this surprised since the former chieftainness...
10145 : But that's nothing for you to worry about! Now hurry off to the Temple of Uggalepih!
10146 : Strange voices...evil spirits... Many mysteries still lurk behind the walls of that ancient temple.
10147 : What arrre you mainlanders thinking?
10148 : You're back, so... What!? You were attacked again!?
10149 : Hah-hah! It looks like the spirit wasn't moved by Angelica's latest work, eitherrr.
10150 : You have the nerrrve to show your face in herrre afterrr what you did?
10151 : How could you even think of touching the %?
10152 : How could you!? I'm sorry... I didn't do anything...
10153 : Liar!
10154 : You may not be able to see it, but the Tonberries' % is therrre in your hands.
10155 : Anyone who has been currrsed by that flame is forrrbidden to enterrr Kazham. I'll give you a day. Get yourrr things togetherrr and get out of my village!
10156 : The % in your body has the power to call forrrth the Tonberries. That is why anyone currrsed with that flame is forrrbidden frrrom enterrring Kazham!
10157 : You have a day. Get yourrr things togetherrr and get out of my village!
10158 : Everyone knows to keep their hands off the Tonberries' %!
10159 : What did you mainlanders eat to grow up so stupid!?
10160 : ... The %...
10161 : If you want to relieve your hands of the Tonberries' currrse, you must, with your %, light the four lanterns on a darkened Altar of Rancor.
10162 : But be ready, for when all four lanterns are lit...
10163 : Are you still herrre? I thought I told you to get out of my village! If you don't leave rrright now, I'll have to dispose of you myself...
10164 : What is this you say? You've removed the curse?
10165 : Well, well, well... I guess there is no longer any reason to banish you from Kazham.
10166 : I can assume that you won't be touching any morrre % from now on, will you?
10167 : Don't get me wrong. I've spent my time in the mainlands. I don't hate all of you.
10168 : But you mainlanders cause too many problems. You should think a little more beforrre you act. Understood?
10169 : Wait up there. Tell me. How did you cure yourself of that curse?
10170 : Not going to tell me? Come on. You can tell me. What did I ever do to you mainlanders to deserve this?
10171 : Hey, did you brrring anything interesting, like %, from the mainland?
10172 : If you did, why don't you show it to Mhebi Juhbily? I know she'd love to see one.
10173 : ...
10174 : You still herrre? Why don't you just get out of my face and let me sulk in peace!?
10175 : Quit it!
10176 : You shouldn't be snooping around in other people's prrroperty!
10177 : No way...
10178 : %! I love these things! Look at how the scales shine!
10179 : Give her the %? Forthwith. Nope.
10180 : Forrr me? Oh, this is absolutely lovely!
10181 : Why, this is purrrfect!
10182 : Damn! You've found him!
10183 : Well, you'd better keep quiet about my frrriend here, or this cat will have your tongue!
10184 : My buddy's name is Tonberrio. Sounds sophisticated, huh? I gave it to him myself.
10185 : I found Tonberrio while I was out hunting in the eastern jungle. He was drowning in a lake, so I saved him.
10186 : But because his knife got wet, it rusted, and now he can't use it for hunting his food.
10187 : I've been trying to help by bringing him meat and letting him sleep herrre, but...
10188 : Well, now that you've seen him, you're in this with me.
10189 : And don't go trying to tell me that Tonberries are our enemy. Tonberrio is different!
10190 : You're going to help me out, right? I guess I have no choice. No way!
10191 : Thanks. What I want to do is get this guy's knife back in chip-chop shape so I can take him back to the jungle.
10192 : But every time I try to get him to let go of it, he just won't budge! How am I supposed to sharpen his knife if he won't let me see it?
10193 : Tonberrio. It's for your own good. Let me see your knife for just a second. Trust me.
10194 : Tonberrio shakes his head.
10195 : Come on, Tonberrio! I'll give it rrright back!
10196 : Tonberrio begins to steam with anger...
10197 : Hmmm... It doesn't look like my buddy's going to listen to rrreason. You don't happen to have any good ideas, do you?
10198 : I want to take Tonberrio back to the jungle, but we have to do something about his knife.
10199 : You don't happen to have any good ideas, do you?
10200 : You say you want a Tonberry knife?
10201 : Hah-hah! I get it! You want to be a chef, and hearrrd that Tonberry knives are the best in Vana'diel, rrright?
10202 : But there's no way even the finest chef could use one of those. They're way too dangerrrous!
10203 : But if you still want one anyway, you're going to have to go to the Temple of Uggalepih. They say that there's a kitchen there where an evil chef spends his days and nights sharrrpening his knives.
10204 : If you still want a Tonberry knife, you're going to have to go to the Temple of Uggalepih.
10205 : You'll find plenty of knives in the kitchen, but keep a sharrrp lookout for the chef! Nya-ha-ha!
10206 : Wow, you rrreally got one! You're the only person I know who would want to get within twenty feet of one of those.
10207 : Hey, you're not going to trrry using that thing, are you?
10208 : Whoa! Where did you get that knife?
10209 : Tonberrio begins to steam with happiness...(?)
10210 : He likes it! Hey, %! Tonberrio likes it!
10211 : I had my doubts about you, but you rrreally came through for me and my buddy.
10212 : Now it's my turn to take Tonberrio back to the jungle where he belongs. I'll miss the little green guy, though.
10213 : I had my doubts about you, but you rrreally came through for me and my buddy. Now I just have to take Tonberrio back to the jungle where he belongs.
10214 : If you want to see Tonberrio, he's still living in that shed.
10215 : He won't move an inch! Do you think that maybe he likes it better herrre in the village?
10216 : That guy over therrre in the funny lookin' clothes says he's from some place called Sand-oreo.
10217 : I wonder if everybody therrre dresses that funny.
10218 : I am a missionary from the San d'Oria Cathedral.
10219 : I am here to teach the savages of this untamed land the true value of life and salvation in the light of the Goddess Altana.
10220 : However, these uncivilized brutes will not listen to a word I say. Oh, how they mock me and my teachings.
10221 : From what I have been able to gather, these primitive women believe that Vana'diel itself is their goddess.
10222 : In all my travels, I have never come across a race so stubborn as these Mithra. They will not try listening to my sermon.
10223 : However, after sleepless nights of prayer, Altana finally granted me with a vision--a method on how to trick these savages into listening.
10224 : But to fulfill the Goddess's wishes, I require an extremely rare ore, obtained only by defeating a terrible monster living in that hellish jungle out there.
10225 : For the sake of these ignorant Mithra, would you be so kind as to retrieve % from the Yuhtunga Jungle for me?
10226 : Help Rauteinot? Yes. No.
10227 : I am disappointed in your reply. However, that will not stop me from continuing my mission. I will pray for you tonight, my child.
10228 : I thank you for your time. Your kindness will not go unrewarded. Let the Goddess be your light of hope on this perilous journey!
10229 : I require % to spread the word of the Goddess Altana. I heard that in rare cases, the monsters in the Yuhtunga Jungle carry them.
10230 : Do not worry. Your kindness will not go unrewarded. Let the Goddess be your light of hope on this perilous journey!
10231 : You have arrived back safely! The Goddess has answered my prayers! Now, take that stone back to San d'Oria and give it to Master Mulaujeant, along with this letter.
10232 : An artisan with his skill should have no problem carving a statue that will move the hearts of the masses.
10233 : Please deliver my letter and the ore you retrieved to Mulaujeant the sculptor in San d'Oria.
10234 : An artisan with his skill should have no problem carving a statue that will move the hearts of the masses.
10235 : Have you brought it? Ah, yes. This is the exact same image I saw in my vision from the Goddess Altana!
10236 : When the heathens of this backwards village lay their eyes upon this immaculate sculpture, they will surely come to their senses!
10237 : A statue of the Goddess Altana, sculpted from a stone that can only be found in Kazham...
10238 : Now I can prove to them that the Dawn Goddess exists even in the earth they tread upon each day.
10239 : Ah, yes. Please accept this as a token of my gratitude. May the light of Altana shine down upon you, always.
10240 : A statue of the Goddess Altana, sculpted from a stone that can only be found in Kazham...
10241 : Now I can prove to them that the Dawn Goddess exists even in the earth they tread upon each day. Now they will listen to me. Now I can cleanse their minds of the filth that befouls them.
10242 : That guy over therrre's been smiling ever since you brought him that doll.
10243 : It's pretty and all, but it's not as cute as my stuffed opo-opo.
10244 : Beautiful maiden! Never did I dream that such a vision of loveliness would bedazzle mine eye in this Goddess-forsaken land!
10245 : Let me introduce myself. My name is Magriffon. I wish I could tell you more, but I'm here on a top-secret mission of national importance.
10246 : However, I cannot ignore a lady in need of assistance. If you ever need anything in this uncivilized wilderness, I would be honored to lend you my hand.
10247 : I would show no mercy to the beast that even pondered laying a finger on your beautiful skin.
10248 : Oh, why if it isn't a robust looking adventurer. I applaud you on what must have been a long journey to this uncivilized wilderness.
10249 : Let me introduce myself. My name is Magriffon. I have been stationed in Kazham for several years on a top-secret mission of national importance.
10250 : During that time, I have come to know the island fairly well. If there is anything I can assist you with, do not hesitate to ask.
10251 : Many dangers lurk behind the beauty of the jungle. Take care when traveling alone.
10252 : <Sigh>
10253 : <Sigh>
10254 : ...
10255 : Like a beam of sunlight through the parting clouds, your smile warms my heart in my time of anguish.
10256 : No, no. There is no need to worry about me. I will be fine...
10257 : Oh, my beautiful %! I knew from the moment I saw you that we were connected. I feel that only one such as you could understand what is troubling me.
10258 : Why, if it is not the robust adventurer who stopped by the other day. You adventurers and your carefree spirits... Warms my heart in my time of anguish.
10259 : No, no. There is no need to worry about me. I will be fine...
10260 : I knew from the moment we first met that you were different from the others. I feel that only an honest, strong, and brave adventurer like yourself could understand what is troubling me.
10261 : Lend Magriffon your ear? Of course! What a gentleman! Something's fishy...
10262 : Yes... A few days ago I was walking through the Yuhtunga Jungle.
10263 : Out of nowhere, I heard a voice. It sounded as if it was beckoning me to stay away. I looked around, but I saw no one.
10264 : And then, out of thin air, appeared a group of these furry little beasts. I think the natives refer to them as Opo-opos.
10265 : They told me that due to the recent influx of adventurers, the jungle was ravaged and their food supply was dwindling.
10266 : I shed tears of pity at their sad, sad story. I felt as if I was obligated to pay for the atrocities that my fellow adventurers had committed. So, I proceeded in giving them all my belongings as a sign of peace.
10267 : However, after I had returned from my journey, I realized that I had made an error in judgment. Within the bag that I had given the Opo-opos was my purse, containing all my gil...
10268 : My fair %. I haven't eaten a decent meal in three days, and the proprietor of this inn is threatening to throw me out if I do not pay her fee...
10269 : However, deep down in my heart I do not regret what I have done for those poor beasts, and I would do the same again in a heartbeat.
10270 : %, my friend. I haven't eaten a decent meal in three days, and the proprietor of this inn is threatening to throw me out if I do not pay her fee...
10271 : However, deep down in my heart I do not regret what I have done for those poor beasts, and I would do the same again in a heartbeat.
10272 : I only regret that I was unable to fulfill my duty to my country!
10273 : If I only had # gil... Yes, # gil. Then I could complete my mission, and I could save all those children...
10274 : If I only had # gil, then I could complete my mission.
10275 : It's a miracle! The Dawn Goddess has shone her light down upon me!
10276 : %! Your beauty comes second only to your generosity. I thank Altana for allowing our paths to cross.
10277 : Your strength and bravery are matched only by your generosity and nobleness. I am proud to call % a friend and an acquaintance.
10278 : And now I can complete my mission.
10279 : I promise you, [my friend/my sweet], that I will never forget your kindness, and I swear I will someday repay you for what you have done for me.
10280 : Now I can complete my top-secret mission.
10281 : I promise you, [my friend/my sweet], that I will never forget your kindness, and I swear I will someday repay you for what you have done for me.
10282 : Ah, if it isn't [my dear friend/my darling,] %. Are you off on another adventure for some poor soul? Remember that the more you give, the more you will get in return. This is the way the world works.
10283 : This can be said of my encounter with those poor Opo-opos.
10284 : Yes, they did walk off with [my beloved furnishing/one of my cards/the strange sand I found on one of my journeys/my pet frog/my belongings], but if it was not for that fateful day, I would have never met you and been graced by your [courage/beauty].
10285 : A miracle it is! A miracle!
10286 : If it isn't my [friend,/darling] %! How fare your perilous adventures?
10287 : Ah, yes. I have a piece of information that you might be interested in. Have you ever been to a place called Norg?
10288 : Have you been there? Yes. No.
10289 : You have? Then you must already know...
10290 : You have not? Well, it is good that you came to me before you wandered in there unknowing. That place will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.
10291 : Norg is a haven for the pirates that bring terror to all who travel the Bastore Sea.
10292 : The other day, I was exploring the cave that is said to lead to their hideout...
10293 : ...when I thought I heard a faint scream. I could not ignore this cry for help, and continued in the direction of the voice.
10294 : That is when I saw her running towards me--a noble-looking woman in a bright green dress.
10295 : She appeared to have been running for quite a distance. When she caught her breath she told me the following:
10296 : I am trying to escape from those evil men in Norg, but I think they are right behind me. Run, before they catch you talking with me.
10297 : However, as you know, my conscience would not allow me to do such a selfish act.
10298 : I moved in front of the mysterious woman and struck down her pursuers. Once I had handled every last one of them, I escorted the lady back to Kazham.
10299 : I nursed her until she regained enough of her strength to return to her homeland of Jeuno.
10300 : But before she parted, she presented me with this %...
10301 : However, I am on a top-secret mission for my country. I have no need of pirate treasure. As long as I have enough gil to pay for my room here at this fine establishment...
10302 : An adventurer, such as yourself, could make better use of this map than I. What do you say? Would you be willing to exchange this map for a small amount of gil?
10303 : Exchange gil for the map? Yes. Not today.
10304 : Blessed again I am by the kindness of my [dear friend,/sweet] %! A mere # gil should be sufficient for me to continue my crucial mission...
10305 : I will exchange with you the % that I received in Norg for a mere # gil.
10306 : What? You say that I must be crazy to give up a chance at a fortune for a small handful of gil? [My dear friend/My sweet], I am on a top-secret mission for my country. I have no need of pirate's treasure. As long as I have enough gil to pay for my room here at this fine establishment...
10307 : Oh! You have made a noble decision. I am, once again, in your debt.
10308 : The woman I saved... She risked her life to escape from Norg with this important %.
10309 : But there is only one way for you to truly realize the danger she faced. And that is finding out what is hidden at the end of this map.
10310 : I hope whatever you find helps you fulfill your dreams. I wish only the best for my dear %.
10311 : Helping others when they face peril. Just as I helped that woman, you have helped me. Your actions reflect the true definition of chivalry!
10312 : You have made a noble decision. I am, once again, in your debt. I hope whatever you find at the end of that map helps you fulfill your dreams.
10313 : From what I can tell, the treasure is more than likely the long-lost... No, it could not be...
10314 : Hey, did you find a piece of paper lying around anywherrre?
10315 : I put up a warning posterrr for adventurerrrs, but I think it's fallen off...
10316 : You've found %? Now whatever could you be speaking of?
10317 : A-ah, yes! The %! I see, I see. So the treasure was the rare %. You are very lucky.
10318 : That particular item can be sold for quite a nice profit at most shops.
10319 : No, no. I need no thanks. May fortune shine upon all your journeys, [my friend/my sweet]!
10320 : % can be sold for quite a nice profit at most shops.
10321 : No, no. I need no thanks. May fortune shine upon all your journeys, [my friend/my sweet]!
10322 : That piece of paperrr you're holding. I've seen that beforrre.
10323 : I wrote that to warn adventurerrrs to stay away from Rafflesia flowerrrs that are full of pollen.
10324 : If you get enough of that foul-smelling stuff on you, you'll have a whole lot less friends. Trust me.
10325 : I'd stay away from Rafflesia flowerrrs if I were you. If you get enough of that foul-smelling pollen on you, you'll have a whole lot less friends. Trust me.
10326 : I'm thinking about writing a warning to tell adventurers that they should stay away from Rafflesia flowerrrs that are full of pollen.
10327 : What is that smell... Oh it's you! Can't you tell?
10328 : Get out of here! We don't want to make the chieftainness any more uptight than she alrrready is!
10329 : Stop rrright there! What business does someone with such a foul stench have with the chieftainness?
10330 : It had better be good, because with that body odor, I wouldn't expect you to be seeing the light of tomorrow.
10331 : You touched a Rafflesia flowerrr, didn't you? You idiot! You mean to tell me you mainlanderrrs' noses are so primitive that you cannot even sense this rrrotten smell?
10332 : If you don't want me to slice you up and serrrve you to the Opo-opos, I would suggest a quick exit. NOW!
10333 : Oh my g... What IS that smell!? Get out of here before we're rrrevisited by those Elshimo frogs I had for lunch!
10334 : Just because something looks interesting doesn't mean you should be putting yourrr paws on it! On what? Why, that flowerrr you touched!
10335 : Wherrre did you think this terrible smell was coming from? Don't tell me you didn't notice.
10336 : ... Poor mainlander... Didn't anyone warrrn you about the Rafflesia flower?
10337 : You might want to try M & P's Market...if there's still any hope for you.
10338 : Ugh! What is this stench!? I can't b-brrreathe!
10339 : You'rrre not the most popular person in town lately, are you? It's that pollen you've got all over you. It may be nothing to you, but to us Mithra, it's about as pleasing as an outhouse in summer.
10340 : If you want people to speak to you again, I would suggest dropping by M & P's Market. If anyone can help you, it would be those two.
10341 : Ughpp...Raff...lesia...rrright?
10342 : The last guy who touched one of those was banished from Kazham for life. It looks like you'rrre going to be next!
10343 : Welcome to Kazha...a lush tropical parad... Would you just hurrrry up and leave!?
10344 : Are you sure you have been cleared to enterrr Kazham? Smelling like that?
10345 : Nothing in this world is crrreated good or evil. However, evil can arrrise when something exists in a place where it did not originally belong.
10346 : Even now, I can smell something on you that does not belong... Something very, verrry, evil...
10347 : Would you mind stepping back? I can't take that wrrretched odor at my age... It makes me dizzy!
10348 : So anotherrr mainlander went off and stuck [his/her] nose where it didn't belong... When will you people learrrn?
10349 : Head over to M & P's. I think I rrremember them talking about an ancient method of rrremoving that smell. Not that it's going to work...
10350 : Hey there, adventurerrr! Have you got you got your fill of Kazham?
10351 : If you have, get out alrrready. You stink!
10352 : I'm going to give you two choices, and then I'm going to give you to the count of ten.
10353 : You can pack up and leave Kazham right now...or you can find some way of getting rrrid of that stench!
10354 : I couldn't imagine going through life smelling like an Opo-opo's drrroppings... Oh, did you hear me?
10355 : You've heard of the Tonberries, rrright? They may look small, but they pack a punch...and they keep coming back for morrre, no matter how many you take out!
10356 : But it looks...I mean, smells like I should have warrrned you about the Rafflesia first!
10357 : Ugh! Didn't you rrread the notice at the airship arrivals exit?
10358 : If Kazham gets any more adventurers like you, we'll all have to move back to the jungle!
10359 : When was the last time you took a bath therrre, adventurer? Eh?
10360 : I'm only telling you this because I like you--you should rrreally get on the next airship and never show your face in this village again.
10361 : I don't mean to be rude, but you smell worse than my Mithran Gaiterrrs.
10362 : Eew! You're not carrying any rrrotten lizard eggs in that pack of yours, are you? It rrreally stinks!
10363 : Okay, okay! I'm awake. I didn't think anything would wake me up, but that smell sure did the trrrick.
10364 : How would you mainlanders put it?
10365 : Forgive my imperrrtinence, but you seem to have a rather unique odorrr about you today... Is that close?
10366 : When it comes to knife-throwing, there isn't a soul that can match the skill of our chieftainness. And with a stench like that, she could probably hit you with her eyes closed.
10367 : If you're going to venture out into the jungle, you should be prrrepared for hideous beasts and hideous odors.
10368 : Maybe I should buy a gas mask for my next trip...
10369 : Leave my worrrkshop. I cannot concentrate with that stench in my house.
10370 : Ah, I love how my blades shine when wielded in the moonlight.
10371 : But if you do not get your rrreeking tail out of my sight, I won't wait until the moon's out to show you how sharp they are.
10372 : Hey [misterrr/lady]...
10373 : Does everrrybody in the mainlands smell as bad as you?
10374 : Many people from the mainlands fear our traditional medicine.
10375 : I can understand people being afraid of things they know little about, but it is unforrrtunate that many dismiss methods before they even try them out.
10376 : <Cough> It seems as if you have spent too much time around one of our jungle's most notorrrious residents...the Rafflesia.
10377 : Hmmm... Much time has passed since you came in contact with the flower, but I still think there is hope for removing that odor.
10378 : Ah, but wait... The Serpent Springs in the Sea Serpent Grotto dried up three years ago.
10379 : This is not good. There is only one way to get that odor out of your system, and that is by bathing in a hot spring. However, it cannot be just any hot spring. It must be one located deep beneath the sea.
10380 : I wonder if there are any otherrr hot springs such as this located in the different regions of Vana'diel...
10381 : Bathing in one of these should remove the odor...unless we are alrrready too late.
10382 : You must find a hot spring, but only one located somewhere deep beneath the sea.
10383 : Bathe in one of these, and it should remove the odor...unless we are alrrready too late.
10384 : Congratulations. I see you were successful in locating another hot spring. You smell a little sweaty, but that is nothing a good shower won't cure.
10385 : This means you can safely stay in Kazham now. Take this. You have worked harrrd for it.
10386 : However, do not assume that I will help you again, should you find yourself in the same predicament.
10387 : Congratulations! Now you can stay in Kazham without drawing everyone's attention.
10388 : Just do not assume that I will help you again, should you find yourself in the same predicament.
10389 : Don't you mainlanders ever learn?
10390 : I told you the last time, I'm not helping you again. You will just have to try remembering what I taught you beforrre.
10391 : Opo-opo!
10392 : Opo opo-opo! Opo-opoh! Opopo! Pohppo-opo!
10393 : Pohppo-opo! Opo? ...
10394 : Opoppo!
10395 : Opoh opo!
10396 : Opopoppo!
10397 : Oh! Ohpo!
10398 : Opopoh-o...
10399 : Popo-o popo-o!
10400 : Poppo-opo!
10401 : Po-oppo Opo-opo!
10402 : Opo-opo-opo-opo-o! Popopo-opopo!
10403 : Ohpo-opo! Poh-opo-o!
10404 : Opopopopo! Opo-opo! Oppo! Oppo-opo!
10405 : Opi!? Opi-opi!?
10406 : It seems as if you handed the Opo-opos the items in the wrong order.
10407 : Now you have to start again from the beginning...
10408 : You don't have to be afrrraid! That Opo-opo likes you!
10409 : He's saying that he likes your smell. He says you smell like the jungle!
10410 : He's also saying that if you give all the Opo-opos in the village a present, they will make you their king!
10411 : He's saying that he wants an Opoppo. That means he wants %!
10412 : But you have to be carrreful. The Opo-opos have a very strrrict system of hierarchy. If an Opo-opo lower than themselves gets a present beforrre they do, they'll go all Opi-opi!
10413 : So, if you don't give them their presents in the rrright order, you'll have to start all overrr again.
10414 : Hey! Vuih! Quit your gabbing and finish what you starrrted!
10415 : Sorry! I'll be rrright there!
10416 : Thanks, Vuih. There isn't a Mithra nicer than you...now, if we could just do something about that smell.
10417 : Ha-ha! Sorry you don't like it! Bye-bye!
10418 : Oh, I didn't tell you my name, did I?
10419 : I'm Vuih Stecoppah. If you messed up the order, come back and see me. I'll see what I can do.
10420 : That Vuih lives alone in the Yuhtunga Jungle. Well, not really alone. She's got hundrrreds of wild friends.
10421 : After that accident with the Rafflesia flower, she hasn't been able to rrremove that odor from her body. If you don't do something about that stench on you, you'll end up just like her!
10422 : How are you doing? Do you remember me?
10423 : I heard from the Opo-opos that you got the order wrrrong and that they didn't make you their king.
10424 : But even if you did know the rrright order, you've got to know what the Opo-opos are saying if you want to know what they want.
10425 : Their language is pretty harrrd, but you look fairrrly smart, so I'll teach you what I know.
10426 : Listen! Opoppo! means %.
10427 : Listen carrrefully! Opoh opo! means %.
10428 : Now listen! Opopoppo! means %.
10429 : Listen up! Oh! Ohpo! means %.
10430 : Listen closely! Opopoh-o means %.
10431 : Listen! Popo-o Popo-o means %.
10432 : Listen carrrefully! Poppo-opo! means %.
10433 : Now listen! Po-oppo Opo-opo! means %.
10434 : Listen up! Opo-opo-opo-opo-o popopo-opopo! means %.
10435 : Listen closely! Ohpo-opo Poh-opo-o! means %.
10436 : There are ten Opo-opos living in this village.
10437 : Vuih Stecoppah brrrought all them to Kazham when they were still babies. That's why they are so friendly around people.
10438 : Opo-opo! Opo-opo! Opo-opo! Opo-opo!!!
10439 : Wow! The Opo-opos are saying that they've made you their king!
10440 : Opoh-opoh! Oppo-opo! Opo-opo! Oppopopoh!!!
10441 : They're saying they are going to give their king their most prrrized possession.
10442 : Oppo-oppo! Opoh-popopoh-opoh! Opoh-popoh!
10443 : Opoh!? Opo-opoh poppopopopo! Opoppo-opo!
10444 : Ohpoh-poh-poh! Oh oh poh poh opoh-poh!
10445 : Opi-opi! Opo-opo opi-opi!
10446 : Opo-opo opi-opi! Opo-opo? Opi-opi?
10447 : Oh, I'm sorry! The Opo-opos just asked you to do something that would have been impossible.
10448 : Here, I'll give you these instead.
10449 : Long live the king! Opo-opo!
10450 : Opo-opo! Ohppo-opo!
10451 : Opo-opo... Ohppo-opo! Poppopopopo!
10452 : And you arrre? %? Neverrr heard of you. There are too many adventurers these days to rememberrr every one that waltzes through our village gates.
10453 : You're going to have to work harderrr if you want anyone to rememberrr a funny name like that.
10454 : And who knows? Someday you could become as famous as me!
10455 : What did you say you called yourself? %? I don't know... I might have heard that name somewherrre.
10456 : Do a little more for the villagers herrre, and people might start remembering who you arrre.
10457 : Wait... Don't tell me... It's...%, right? Yeah, I've been hearing your name more often lately.
10458 : A little bit more work, and soon everybody will know who you arrre.
10459 : Hi therrre, %. I've been telling everybody about my new friend. We're friends, right?
10460 : Keep up the good work. The betterrr my friends look, the betterrr I look!
10461 : Oh, %! Long time no see! Your name comes up a lot these days.
10462 : And guess what? Nobody has anything bad to say about you. That's a compliment in itself!
10463 : You know, I don't think there's a person in this village who doesn't know yourrr name.
10464 : You keep up the good work, and I'll have to start calling you [Mister/Miss] %!
10465 : [Mister/Miss] %! Arrre you heading out on anotherrr dangerous mission? Be careful! We'll all be rooting for you.
10466 : I know it has been hard to get such a good reputation, but don't take it for granted. Yourrr work is farrr from being done!
10467 : [Mister/Miss] %! You are one smooth cat! I've neverrr met a mainlander who did so much for us islanders.
10468 : I'm proud to call you my acquaintance...my friend!
10469 : [Lord/Lady] %! The fame your name carries stretches from here to Windurst.
10470 : I cannot begin to put into words the gratitude this village feels forrr you. Live long, hero of Kazham!
10471 : I wasn't expecting minister Rukususu to come-ity here and begin her research on Elshimo so soon.
10472 : However, when I offered to show-ity her the Yhoator Jungle and the Sea Serpent Grotto, she turned me down and setaru off on her own!
10473 : All alone in the jungle with those Tonberries...I hope she's all rightaru!
10474 : Rhinostery minister? Here in Kazham?
10475 : Oh, yes. Now I remember. That strrrange little lady with the funny accent. Yes, she kept asking me about the ancient times, so I sent her to someone ancient--our former chieftainness.
10476 : ... Rukususu...
10477 : She said she was looking for a cerrrtain Iru-Kuiru...
10478 : This Iru-Kuiru was banished to the Temple of Uggalepih years ago. If you want to find Rukususu, that is where you should start searching.
10479 : If you want to find Rukususu, go to the Temple of Uggalepih. That is all I have to tell you.
10480 : Before minister Rukususu returned to the mainly-mainlands, I was able to give her my report on my findings here in Elshimo.
10481 : She was very pleased with all the lovely-wuvly discoveries that we had made.
10482 : But we couldn't have done it without the help of adventurers like you!
10483 : For your own safety, it is recommended that you set this location as your home point after changing jobs.
10484 : You obtain three %.
10485 : Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!
10486 : Try though you may, there will come a time when failure is inevitable.
10487 : Channel that agony and bitterness into creating a new plan.
10488 : Owzie-wowzie! Don't make me talk. I hurt all over!
10489 : Hey! You're that famous adventurer, %!
10490 : Yippee! This is my lucky day!
10491 : Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.
10492 : And I'm the besty-westy they've got! I've been looking into phenomena at a certain place.
10493 : What phenomena, you ask? Well, there are these giant crystals, you see! And from those crystals, a strangey-wangey power is constantly pouring forth...
10494 : These crystals are found all over Vana'diel, and their energies affect the surrounding ecosystems.  Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when...
10495 : Guess what!
10496 : We finally succeeded in awakening the crystals!
10497 : Our theory on what lay dormant inside the crystals was proven to be rightaru on the money! Except they didn't appreciate being woken up... We were attacked... We were bested-wested...
10498 : Why do they so despise talking with us that they would rather fight? And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?
10499 : I bet you could do it! You call yourself an adventurer, right? Give it a shot!
10500 : Take up the challenge? Bring it on! Ah, no, thanks...
10501 : Great! Here, take this %. But be warned--only a person who carries one can enter the crystal.
10502 : This % will awaken the giant crystal that is found [in Ifrit's Cauldron/in the Quicksand Caves/in the Den of Rancor/in Cape Teriggan/in Fei'Yin/in The Boyahda Tree].
10503 : Without it, you won't be getting inside no matter how sneaky-weaky you are! Oh, and if you want to take some friends with you, they also have to get % from me. Okey-dokey?
10504 : If you don't prepare yourself for battle, you'll get beaten to a pulp, like we did!
10505 : As soon as we gather our companions, we'll be jumping into the fray again.  I just hope this little researcher doesn't get in our way...
10506 : What nonsense! If I don't go with you, there's no pointaru to the research now, is there?
10507 : How'd it go!? Wowy-wow-wow! You defeated a prime avatar!
10508 : ...I see. The prime avatar said that to you? I wonder what it could mean.
10509 : ...There is no need to understand... ...You will forget what I have said...
10510 : Y-you, you're...!
10511 : ...You have power...
10512 : ...Will you allow...that power... ...to slumber...for eternity...?
10513 : Surrender...that power...to me... and I...will craft...that power... into whatever...you desire...
10514 : ...We meet...again...
10515 : ...My charge...must...be...fulfilled...
10516 : The beast...will claim...its due...
10517 : Choose... What...do you desire...? What...do you seek?
10518 : What do you desire? %. %. %. %. Gil. Nothing (a pact with the avatar).
10519 : ...This is what you desire...?
10520 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10521 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10522 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10523 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10524 : Gil is what you truly want? Yes. Wait!
10525 : Are you sure? Yes. Wait!
10526 : Listen...to the voice without--my voice--with your ears...and your heart...
10527 : Bring me...   Power...      Higher...        Deeper...           ......             Stronger...
10528 : ...? ...something...interfering...?
10529 : %...! Listen to the voice within you!
10530 : If you focus, you will see the true Vana'diel!
10531 : ...Even if...that...
10532 : Uh? Huh? I went all spacey-wacey for a moment there...
10533 : Um, who were you again? Was I speaking with you? What were we talking about?
10534 : Did I tell you I'm a researcher from the Rhinostery in Windurst already?
10535 : You are now able to summon [Ifrit/Titan/Leviathan/Garuda/Shiva/Ramuh].
10536 : Huh? What? Do I know where Ildy-Goldy is?
10537 : Yeah, you justaru missed him. He went off towards Cape Terrrigan with the improved tuning fork of air.
10538 : Ildy-Goldy will wipe the floor with that avatar. I wonder what kind of research data he'll bring back for us?
10539 : Hm? Did he seem a little different from usual?
10540 : Well, now that you mention it, he did ask me to give this to any adventurers that came looking for him...
10541 : I guess that must mean you. Here you go. Seems like a clear invitation to go take on the avatar in Cape Teriggan yourself.
10542 : I've given you what Ildy-Goldy had me hold on to. You should be on your way to Cape Teriggan.
10543 : ...Hm? You're going to help out Ildy-Goldy, but first you want to take on the avatar in Cape Teriggan under your own steam?
10544 : Check it out yourself? I like to do things my way... All on my lonesome...?
10545 : ...You got guts, kid. Well, either way is fine with me.
10546 : What!? You lost the %!?
10547 : What kind of an adventurer are you...? Well, don't go losing this one, okay?
10548 : ...We m-m-meet again... ...There is no need for violence, adventurer...
10549 : ...I just wish to ask you som-m-me questions. ...Why do you think the avatars...give power to people...without a reason...?
10550 : ..And...have you...felt the power...of the avatars...?
10551 : Hahaha... ...Rather than strength without purpose...  ...you should be seeking...true power...
10552 : We m-m-meet...again... I must...fulfill...my charge.
10553 : You must...seek power...
10554 : ...And I...shall c-c-claim...my due...
10555 : What? You want another %?
10556 : Oh, all right... But be careful-wareful with this one! These things don't grow on star trees, you know.
10557 : Hmmm... Hrmmm... So it's time to use...no...
10558 : Hello? You're an adventurer, right? Maybe you can help us out.
10559 : Let me introduce myself and my companion. We're from the Rhinostery in Windurst.
10560 : I was hired by the ministry to accompany this researcher to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree] and assist him in his study of a series of giant crystals.
10561 : But what was waiting for us inside those crystals was more than I could deal with...
10562 : We tried countless times, but I could not defeat that beast. Another researcher at the Rhinostery sympathized with our plight and developed an improved tuning fork.
10563 : No no no no no! That crazy-wazy contraption won't provide us with any useful data!
10564 : Listen, muscle-hussle brain. Science is not about winning or spinning, life or strife, even or Steven! It's a more delicate subjectaru!
10565 : Do you see what I have to deal with? I don't know how much longer I can work with such a pessimist.
10566 : That's where you come in. I was thinking of letting one of you adventurers test out the new fork and prove to my colleague that it is able to return data valuable to his research.
10567 : No no no no no! Even if they use that half-rate spork, it'll take a tip-top summoner to defeat the prime avatar!
10568 : Listen up. The fandangled % won't make it any easier for you to downright defeat the monster inside the crystal. Sure, it'll lower the power of the prime avatar to around #, but it will do the same to you! And on top of that, you'll only be able to summon that itty-bitty blue bugger, Carbuncle!
10569 : And to make things worse, nobody-buddy else can enter the crystal with you! You'll be battling one-on-one, man-to-man, Taru-et-Taru!
10570 : ... Yes, but sir... The Rhinostery has been pressing us to produce results. If we do not take some sort of action quickly...
10571 : Hmmm... You do have a point there... I guess one round with a prime avatar wouldn't hurtaru.
10572 : No, one round could not hurt.
10573 : You know that you probably won't gain anything from this battle-waddle. Are you sure you still want the fork?
10574 : Are you really-dilly sure? Fork me! On second thought...
10575 : Well, you asked for it! Take this % and ring it near one of those giant crystals. The prime avatar won't be slap-happy to be woken up, and you'll have to deal with its wrath.
10576 : I guess because you are helping us check out this new tuning fork, I can use my mighty-minty magic to warp you near the giant crystal in [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]. When you're ready, just show my companion the %.
10577 : The researcher who made the % warned that the door home would only open to those who defeated the prime avatar.
10578 : I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean, but I suggest that you prepare well before taking on this journey. Remember, you have to be at least a level # summoner.
10579 : Are you and Carbuncle ready to fight the prime avatar as a level # summoner?
10580 : Also, regardless of whether you defeat the avatar or not, you will be unable to re-enter the protocrystal again for a number of days.
10581 : Are you sure you are ready? Off to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree]! My dog ate my mini tuning fork. Not just yet...
10582 : Sir, our adventurer has completed [his/her] preparations and requests a warp.
10583 : ... Abracadoodle-strudel-poodle... ...
10584 : Sha-mone!
10585 : Don't use that excuse on me, [young man/young lady]. If you want another %, all you have to do ask.
10586 : If you do not bring the % we gave you, my companion cannot warp you to [Ifrit's Cauldron/the Quicksand Caves/the Den of Rancor/Cape Teriggan/Fei'Yin/the Boyahda Tree].
10587 : Did you remember to bring the %?
10588 : What!? You defeated the prime avatar!?
10589 : Sir!
10590 : Hmmm... Just as I thoughtaru. The prime avatar that you fought with this spunky-junky tuning fork was nothing but a fake. Researching real avatars with real tuning forks is how real researchers do real research in the real world!
10591 : ... Sir...
10592 : ... (Now if I could only find me some real work so I could do some real adventuring...)
10593 : I don't think you'll get much out of it, but if you want to go get your buttaru kicked by the prime avatar again, all you have to do is ring another % near a giant crystal.
10594 : Remember that you must fight the prime avatar as a level # summoner. As you already know, this will not be an easy task. Prepare well for the battle.
10595 : Do you want another mini tuning fork? Fork me baby, one more time. Stick a fork in me, I'm done.
10596 : Hey! You're that famous adventurer, %!
10597 : Maybe you can help us outaru!
10598 : Let me introduce myself. I am from the Rhinostery in Windurst. I do research on various living things.
10599 : You already-weddy know about the super-giant crystals, rightaru?
10600 : These crystals are found all over Vana'diel, and their energies affect the surrounding ecosystems.  Our research team had been investigating the unusual emanations when POOF, out of nowhere, a prime avatar appeared and sliced 'n diced us down to size.
10601 : Why do these avatars so despise talking with us that they would rather fight? And what on Vana'diel would happen if someone were to defeat them?
10602 : You were able to handle one all by yourself. You should have no problem defeating one with your buddy-wuddies. You'll help us out, right?
10603 : Ahem, now let me introduce myself...
10604 : Ah, you are back. How was your battle with the avatar?
10605 : Remember, the protocrystals will only resonate with the tuning forks ever so often. Use this time to rest before taking upon another challenge.
10606 : I'm a traveling moogle, kupo. I help adventurers in the Outlands access items they have stored in a Mog House elsewhere, kupo.
10607 : This isn't a Mog House, so you can only use the Mog Safe, Change Jobs, and Delivery Box commands, kupo.
10608 : You have to pay fee of # gil to transfer your items to the Outlands, kupo. Why? Because the world is a cold place for rogue moogles, kupo.
10609 : Of course, you can move your items back to your Mog House in town, but if you want to transfer them to the Outlands again, you'll have to pay another fee, kupo. I've got to make a living too, kupo.
10610 : Transfer items? (Current gil:#) Pay # gil. Don't transfer items.
10611 : You don't have enough gil, kupo.
10612 : Item transfer complete, kupo.
10613 : # , #
10614 : If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess % and have a high enough job level.
10615 : You can rent a chocobo for # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
10616 : You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.
10617 : If you still want one, it will cost you # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
10618 : Do you wish to rent a chocobo? Yes, I do. No, thank you.
10619 : You don't have enough gil.
10620 : I realize that you are in a hurry, [sir/ma'am]. However, might I make a simple request? One of our associate's chocobos has lost her way and cannot return home.
10621 : Would you be so kind as to deliver her to [the Kingdom/the Republic/the Federation/the Duchy/the Duchy/the Duchy/the hidden] stables in [Southern San d'Oria/the Bastok Mines/Windurst Woods/Upper Jeuno/Lower Jeuno/Port Jeuno/Norg]?
10622 : Lend a helping hand? I have better things to do. Of course!
10623 : Oh, thank you so very much! You shall be rewarded by our associates upon delivery of the chocobo.
10624 : You cannot obtain the %. Come back after sorting your inventory.
10625 : Would you be so kind as to deliver her to [the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?
10626 : Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo. First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of %.
10627 : Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of # Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have # Allied Notes.
10628 : Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
10629 : I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with %. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?
10630 : Is there something you require?
10631 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
10632 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.
10633 : Now close your eyes...
10634 : Which memory will you have recalled? Nothing. Zilart Missions. Kazham Quests. Other Quests.

10639 : Ah, if it isn't %. Lately, I've been hearrring rumors about you. They say that for a mainlander, you are quite talented when it comes to wielding a daggerrr.
10640 : I'm not one to brrrag, but I, too, am quite skilled with knives. Why, just the other day I came up with a new technique that can slice and dice even the toughest Tonberrry.
10641 : But there's a problem...
10642 : If anybody gets their grrrimy hands on it, I'll be in trrrouble. That's why I have to start practicing dodging the technique as well as using it.
10643 : And that's the prrroblem. None of the pussycats around here have the skill required to perrrform it!
10644 : If I could only find someone that could match me in battle...
10645 : How about you? Do you want to take a stab at learrrning my new technique?
10646 : Here, take one of my daggerrrs and practice until the blade's been completely drrrained of its power. Come back here when you're done, and I'll show you my secrrrets.
10647 : If you want to learn my new technique, you're going to have to train with that daggerrr. Do you have a prrroblem with that!?
10648 : Any complaints? No, ma'am! I seem to have misplaced the dagger. I've had enough of this training.
10649 : You lose any more of my belongings, and I will scrrratch your eyes out and eat them for dinner!
10650 : So, you mean to say this task was too difficult for you?
10651 : Really quit your training? Yes. Not just yet.
10652 : Hmph. Well, I guess it's betterrr this way. I prrrobably would have killed a weakling like you just showing you the technique.
10653 : Oh, and you can get rid of that daggerrr yourself. I wouldn't think of using another [man's/woman's] weapon.
10654 : That daggerrr I gave you, I made it myself--rrright down to its hidden abilities. But the more you use it, the less powerful it becomes.
10655 : When all its powerrr is gone, bring it back here and we'll test how good you rrreally have become.
10656 : You're far from being done, [tigerrr/kitty]. When all the dagger's power is gone, bring it back here. Then we'll test how good you rrreally have become.
10657 : Ah, so you're finally done. I was beginning to worry that you'd neverrr come back.
10658 : Now it's time to see if you rrreally have what it takes to be my parrrtner in prrractice. Take this map to the Gustav Tunnel and dice up the monster waiting for you there.
10659 : And don't forget to brrring back %. Otherwise, how am I supposed to know that you just didn't have some of your cat pack defeat the monsterrr for you?
10660 : Now get out of here! The quicker you get back from the Gustav Tunnel, the quicker I can start prrracticing!
10661 : You're finally back! Congrrratulations on taking out the monster in the tunnel.
10662 : If you could handle that beast, then you are more than worrrthy to learn my new technique. Now let's begin...
10663 : So what do you think? Never seen anything like it before, have you? I must say, I am one smarrrt cat.
10664 : Thanks to you, I also was able to come up with a way to dodge it. What? You want me to teach you that, too?
10665 : I'm sorry, but that won't be possible. To tell you the trrruth, the only real way to dodge that technique would involve killing your opponent.
10666 : You wouldn't want to be killed by me now, would you?
10667 : You have learned the weapon skill Evisceration!
10668 : OK
10669 : NG
10670 : Number # is the answer.
10671 : Excuse me, [sir/madam]. If you are boarding the airship, might I ask you a favor?
10672 : A passenger who intended to board the next flight dropped this...
10673 : I cannot leave my post, so I was wondering if you could return it to its rightful owner in my stead?
10674 : Return the dropped item? Gladly. Sorry, I'm a busy [man/woman].
10675 : Thank you! The passenger who dropped the item looked like this.
10676 : Have you memorized the image?
10677 : Have you got it? I got it. Not yet.
10678 : The passenger who dropped the item should be on the next flight.
10679 : I leave the rest in your capable hands.
10680 : I see... I'm sorry to have bothered you with such a trivial request.
10681 : Oh, the airship has already left... I guess we'll just have to leave this with the airship authorities.
10682 : You were unable to meet with the rightful owner of the item? Well, thank you for your help, in any case. I will hand the item over to the airship authorities.
10683 : What, you've forgotten already?
10684 : Have you forgotten? Yes. No.
10685 : The passenger looked like this.
10686 : It's my job to look out for suspicious characters coming in on the airships.
10687 : You say you're looking for a Mithran Tracker?
10688 : You're gonna have to be more specific. There're several sin hunters prowling arrround your continent right now.
10689 : All hell's brrreaking loose in our homeland.
10690 : For some rrreason, the Emptiness of legend has appeared, despite our constant battles with the beastmen...
10691 : But that's neither here nor there.
10692 : So which Tracker are you looking for? The one hunting dragons? The one hunting songs? Or the one hunting gods?
10693 : A Mithra wearing a black helm? Ah, you'd be looking for Shikaree Y, then. She's always rrrubbing people's fur the wrong way.
10694 : Chieftainness Jakoh. That sin hunter vas headed for Xarcabard vith an untested Rhinostery tuning fork.
10695 : Ve vish to track her down. Vhere is the crystal of darkness mentioned in the legends of the Mithra?
10696 : Why would I know a thing like that, Ildy-Goldy?
10697 : I just took over here as chieftainness. Why don't you dirrrect your questions to our old boss?
10698 : Romaa Mihgo? Ve Tarutaru--or more specifically the Rhinostery--are not on the bestaru of terms vith your former chieftainness.
10699 : It vas connected to the allied expedition. Iru-Kuiru of the Rhinostery hired Yow Rabntah as an adventurer, and the tragedy that followed drove a vedge between us and the Mithra of Kazham...
10700 : I have the same kind of prrroblems when it comes to Romaa. I had a run-in with her daughter, Nanaa Mihgo.
10701 : But Romaa still rrrecognized my strength when it came to choosing a new chieftainness. She doesn't let her emotions interfere with important matters.
10702 : You two are trying to help Shikaree Y, rrright?
10703 : Be honest in your apprrroach and she'll tell you what you need to know. Romaa's probably mellowed out in her old age.
10704 : Thank you for your advice. Ve vill see vhat Romaa Mihgo has to say.
10705 : From the time of that expedition thirty years ago until my inauguration as chieftainness...
10706 : Kazham has not been gentle with outsiders. That's just the kind of people we Mithra are.
10707 : Former Chieftainness Romaa Mihgo. I am Ildy-Goldy, an adventurer of the Rhinostery. This is %.
10708 : Ve are looking for a Mithran Tracker who visited Vindurst.
10709 : This Mithran Tracker traveled to the Northlands bearing a tuning fork of the Rhinostery. She has failed to return.
10710 : This new model of tuning fork vas designed to resonate vith the protocrystals of the great beings.
10711 : However, this fork is vildly more powerful than the previous models. Its reliability has not been tested and, frankly-vankly, ve are rather vorried.
10712 : Ve suspectaru the sin hunter has been unable to leave the crystal of darkness...
10713 : Your worry is misplaced.
10714 : Having a bunch of Tarutaru concerned for her welfare would be an insult worse than death for a trrracker.
10715 : While it is trrrue that a tracker's senses are dulled in the Northlands, she's not some kitten to lose her way in the snow.
10716 : But if she never returns, this situation vill escalate into a crime the Rhinostery mustaru answer to, correct?
10717 : The allied expedition is a case-vase in pointaru.
10718 : The Rhinostery is still haunted by the tragedy that befell Yow Rabntah after she vas employed by Iru-Kuiru.
10719 : You expelled all of our researchers from your town and closed the gates of Kazham.
10720 : ...
10721 : I am sorry. I did not come here to open old vounds. Ve do not vish for conflictaru.
10722 : Ve do not vant to jeopardize the ties that have been repaired betveen Kazham and the Rhinostery.
10723 : Perhaps our renewed peace is not something you vish for...
10724 : There are times when conflict is necessary...
10725 : Rrrather than wandering in circles, endlessly repeating the same tired arguments... There are times when victory or defeat can prrrovide a clear answer.
10727 : My time in the sun has ended...
10728 : The Rhinostery has changed, as well. New members like you will shoulder the rrresponsibilities of this age, and forge new ties...
10729 : But me... I'm an old-fashioned kinda girl.
10730 : The Minister of the Rhinostery came looking for the place where Iru-Kuiru met his doom. I required a certain challenge to be met...
10731 : This impasse will be decided by victory or defeat. If your strength prrroves victorious, I will answer your request.
10732 : You will undertake the same challenge. Use your strength to decide the outcome of this impasse...
10733 : I understand. It is the Mithran vay to bow to strength. I vill bring you the victory you demand.
10734 : Good. Go to the waterfall in the east of the Yuhtunga Jungle.
10735 : If you throw a pebble into the falls, a monster will appear. Your task is to defeat the crrreature and return here alive.
10736 : %... You will watch the battle from a hill overlooking the waterfall.
10737 : You will see that he doesn't employ the help of other adventurers, or use any other devious tactics...
10738 : I vill not cheat. I vill single-handedly defeataru any creature you send me against!
10739 : Let's go, %. Find a high place in the east of Yuhtunga from vhere you can see the battle at the vaterfall.
10740 : Go to the hill overlooking the waterfall in the east of the Yuhtunga Jungle...
10741 : You will see that he doesn't employ the help of other adventurers, or use any other devious tactics...
10742 : Romaa Mihgo! Ve have returned victorious!
10743 : You underestimated %'s strength. You have the answer you asked for.
10744 : Hmm, so you survived my trial.
10745 : Your failure to rrreach your companion's side in time does not speak highly of your ability, Ildy-Goldy...
10746 : However, I will recognize this adventurer's victory.
10747 : Hurrah! You did it, %!
10748 : To business... You wanted to know where to find Shikaree Y?
10749 : Yes.
10750 : Justaru as a great crystal of fire lies hidden in the Yuhtunga Jungle, a crystal of darkness supposedly exists in the Northlands.
10751 : Ve are certain this dark protocrystal vas the sin hunter's destination.
10752 : Your instincts were correct. According to the legends, the god that slumbers within that crystal is the closest to waking...
10753 : Our legends say that in the ancient past, the deity within the crystal of darkness awoke...
10754 : Vone of the sleeping gods--vone of the great beings--vas avake!?
10755 : It is said that the deity was led again into slumber by the light of a certain box.
10756 : However, the sleep of this divinity is shallow, and he will answer the questions of those who appear before him...
10757 : I see. And the tracker vent to speak vith this god?
10758 : That is likely the case...
10759 : But the rrresting place of this god is unknown to me.
10760 : In Norg, there are old tales among the pirrrates that tell of an unusual box...
10761 : These tales are surely known to Kamui, the aged officer that attends Gilgamesh.
10762 : If you give the guard at the door %, %, and %, you should be allowed to ask a few questions.
10763 : Thank you.  Ve vill talk to this Kamui.
10764 : One last thing. I wouldn't pursue the sin hunter too far...
10765 : Mithran Trackers live for the hunt, but they do not apprrreciate being hunted. If you find she is safe and well, you would be wise to leave her be...
10766 : In the ancient past, the god that abides within the crystal of darkness awoke...
10767 : The deity was led again into slumber by the light of a certain box.
10768 : Tales of this box will surely be known to Kamui, the aged officer that attends Gilgamesh...
10769 : Why, what [a stunning beauty you are/a heroic-looking adventurer]! How go your travels in this trouble-filled land?
10770 : You have a fascinating tale for me this day, [my lady/good sir]? A letter from a Goblin in Jeuno, you say...?
10771 : Why, if it isn't [my angel-kissed beauty/my heroic adventurer friend]! What service would you ask of humble Magriffon?
10772 : How awful! What a tragic and heartrending drama!
10773 : These Moblins are reviled by people and beastmen alike for unwavering faith in their chosen deity...
10774 : And this means they must huddle beneath the earth in isolation and loneliness!?
10775 : <Sigh> That is a fate I relate to most keenly.
10776 : I still brave the pangs of solitude for the sake of fulfilling my duty...
10777 : One lifespan is scarce enough time to relate your feelings to those around you. And questioning the world merely hastens the flow of time's river.
10778 : And yet despite this, the Moblins have tried to communicate their faith to the world...
10779 : I shall take up their cause! I, Magriffon, shall build a bridge between the Moblins and the world of people.
10780 : However... The plan I am about to tell you is of a delicate and daring nature, and will require a dose of phenomenal luck.
10781 : This % I possess will be of immeasurable use to you, [my intoxicating flower/my resourceful hero].
10782 : It brings astounding luck upon the bearer. Why, I owe our miraculous meeting to its influence over fortune's fancy.
10783 : It brings astounding luck upon the bearer. Why, I owe my peaceful existence in this Mithran village to its influence over fortune's fancy.
10784 : I will let go of this wondrous treasure for a mere # gil. These bouts of generosity will be my undoing, I'm afraid...
10785 : With this % by your side, [my intoxicating flower/my resourceful hero], astounding fortune will be yours! I will let you purchase this wondrous treasure for a mere # gil!
10786 : What incredible fortuity! The % is yours!
10787 : Now fate will twist in your favor, my [breathtaking butterfly/splendid hero]!
10788 : I have set down a strategy in this letter. Please be so kind as to deliver it to Muckvix.
10789 : Hahaha! May dazzling fortune smile upon thee, my [reason for breathing/daring adventurer]!
10790 : Let us overcome all obstacles that stand between us and the completion of our duty!
10791 : Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
10792 : I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain %.
10793 : Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
10794 : May I be of service? Not now. Learn recipes. Check fewell. Replenish fewell. Purchase materials. Receive training. Trade cinder. Get information.
10795 : Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
10796 : ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
10797 : I've got it! How about %? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...
10798 : Synergy skill: [Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice/Journeyman/Craftsman/Artisan/Adept/Veteran].

10816 : There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
10817 : But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your % for a moment...
10818 : Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: # # # # # # # #.
10819 : Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
10820 : Replenish fewell? Yes. No.
10821 : Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
10822 : ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
10823 : Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for # gil.  How does that sound?
10824 : Pay # gil? Deal! No thanks.
10825 : Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
10826 : I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
10827 : Excellent! Now we just pop open your % here, and...
10828 : There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
10829 : Your % has been filled to capacity!
10830 : You hand the synergy engineer # gil.
10831 : How do you expect me to do that when your % is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
10832 : Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
10833 : Purchase something? Not today. # %: # gil. # ): # gil. # ): # gil.
10834 : For # %, that comes to # gil.
10835 : Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
10836 : ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
10837 : And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
10838 : Train in which technique? Cancel. Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: #) Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: #) Safety lever. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: #) Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: #)
10839 : You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
10840 : It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
10841 : Train in this technique? Yes. No.
10842 : Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
10843 : ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
10844 : ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
10845 : ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
10846 : <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
10847 : ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
10848 : Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level #!
10849 : Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
10850 : Trade in your cinder? (Currently: # Pz) Not now. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. # gil: # Pz.
10851 : This is what you want, correct?
10852 : Make the exchange? Yes. No.
10853 : It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
10854 : Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
10855 : You transferred # Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. # Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
10856 : Ask about what? Nothing. Synergy furnaces. Synergy overview. Synergy procedure. Synergy recipes. Fewell replenishment. Materials for sale. Synergy techniques. Trading cinder.
10857 : The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
10858 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
10859 : Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
10860 : Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
10861 : You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
10862 : Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
10863 : This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call fewell. To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
10864 : As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
10865 : With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
10866 : The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
10867 : But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
10868 : If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
10869 : Take heart, though, as any materials inside your % will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
10870 : Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
10871 : Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
10872 : Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
10873 : You may be asking yourself, Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?
10874 : Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
10875 : The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
10876 : Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of %, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
10877 : Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that % may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
10878 : Mind you, % is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
10879 : Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
10880 : First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
10881 : You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
10882 : Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
10883 : You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
10884 : From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
10885 : Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
10886 : Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
10887 : However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
10888 : If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
10889 : You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
10890 : The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
10891 : It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
10892 : This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
10893 : As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
10894 : For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
10895 : You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
10896 : In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
10897 : Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
10898 : If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
10899 : Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
10900 : What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
10901 : The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
10902 : ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
10903 : Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
10904 : Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
10905 : Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
10906 : The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
10907 : In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as % can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
10908 : % cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of % can then be embedded.
10909 : The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
10910 : If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
10911 : As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
10912 : You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
10913 : Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
10914 : My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
10915 : The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
10916 : Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
10917 : To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
10918 : When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
10919 : Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
10920 : Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
10921 : As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call fewell. The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
10922 : Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
10923 : To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
10924 : For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
10925 : That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your %! What could be easier?
10926 : Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of %? If so, you've come to the right place!
10927 : We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
10928 : Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
10929 : Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
10930 : Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
10931 : My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
10932 : Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
10933 : Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
10934 : Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
10935 : The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
10936 : Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
10937 : Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
10938 : We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
10939 : It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
10940 : Wondering if your % can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
10941 : A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
10942 : Congratulations! Your % can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A %-shaped aperture, to be exact...
10943 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: # / [///////].
10944 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
10945 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
10946 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
10947 : That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
10948 : Hmm... I'm afraid your % cannot house any more apertures.
10949 : ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your % cannot be etched.
10950 : Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your % cannot be etched at this time.
10951 : Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

10955 : Oh, the %? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
10956 : Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
10957 : Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
10958 : Learn about synergy? Not today. Teach me! Just give me %.
10959 : A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
10960 : I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
10961 : Using % in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
10962 : What we call % serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
10963 : Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
10964 : Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your % into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
10965 : Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
10966 : Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
10967 : You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
10968 : But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
10969 : A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
10970 : That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
10971 : An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for %, you've certainly come to the right place.
10972 : I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for # gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
10973 : # gil, paid in full!
10974 : As promised, here's your %. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
10975 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
10976 : Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
10977 : Oh, my. It's not often we get to see such splendidly attirrred adventurers here in Kazham.
10978 : I see no reason why you shouldn't be the one to receive my letter.
10979 : Well, to be perrrfectly honest, I was going to send it off to the moogles. But between the running of Kazham and keeping its surrounds trrrouble-free, it completely escaped my mind.
10980 : Now that the letter's in your possession, best you make yourself scarrrce, lest Etteh and her friends catch on.
10981 : She and some other kittens have been obsessed with getting their paws on it, you see. The madness in their eyes is downrrright unsettling!
10982 : Keep your guard up even after you've returrrned to the mainland, or the Mithra there will pounce on you and make off with the letter quicker than you can say Happy Eighth Vana'versary!
10983 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
10984 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
10985 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
10986 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
10987 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
10988 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
10989 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
10990 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
10991 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
10992 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
10993 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
10994 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
10995 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
10996 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
10997 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
10998 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
10999 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
11000 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
11001 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
11002 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
11003 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!

11005 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?

11019 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
11020 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
11021 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
11022 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
11023 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
11024 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.

11035 : You need to talk to me? You must be mistaken, as I'd never play the role of a bleeding heart for a jackanapes like you.
11036 : Hm? Oh, so you're that % I've heard so much about. It certainly took you long enough. Did you fall faint from a head wound along the way?
11037 : But enough chin-wagging. Let us slice open the matter at hand to reveal its pulsating innards.
11038 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Ask a bunch of questions. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
11039 : Your sundry questions force my thoughts to wander... Back to the metallic flavor of that crimson, esprit-effusing ambrosia as it assaults my tongue drop by drop...
11040 : Anyhow, no one explains much to me. They never seem to stick around long enough. Please discuss such matters with a Voidwatch Officer. They'd know more than I, and many of them have voluminous, visible veins that throb with each heartbeat, the blood inside rapping against the walls of its prison...
11041 : That flushed face of yours speaks volumes. You've done fine work, indeed. Beware not to clot your adventures by lingering on Elshimo. Follow the current to Zepwell Island, then circulate back to Norg upon completing your tasks there.
11042 : Beyond that, I offer naught but visceral conjecture. However, proving you possess a bloodstained battle record and grisly determination may gain you entry to the bowels of truth.
11043 : Of course you'd say that. Why else would you brave the hot Kazham sun, sizzling your flesh? Oh, how the aroma invades my nostrils, pillaging my senses until nothing but that instinctual craving for... I'm very sorry. I've terrible concentration problems. Anyway, your answer allows me to cut out the heart of this issue.
11044 : Please carry out your mission at the following locales: Yuhtunga Jungle, Ifrit's Cauldron, and the Temple of Uggalepih.
11045 : Worry not about the order of your objectives, so long as you complete them by bashing in your targets' brains, exposing the smooth slime inside that leaves a thick film upon my tongue as I slurp it... Many pardons.
11046 : Now deploy to those areas I mentioned and make our magnificent Voidwatch proud!
11047 : May you slay numerous enemies and scatter their remains across the four directions!
11048 : You must still proceed to [the Yuhtunga Jungle/Ifrit's Cauldron/the Yuhtunga Jungle./Ifrit's Cauldron./the Temple of Uggalepih.][, Ifrit's Cauldron,/ and the Temple of Uggalepih./ and Ifrit's Cauldron.][ and the Temple of Uggalepih./]
11049 : How many would you like? None. Just one. Fill me up!
11050 : Here, as per your request. Please don't perish before depleting your stock of them.
11051 : I feel foolish having to remind you, but you already possess the maximum allocation of # stones. There is no need to procure more.
11052 : Our stock has regrettably run out. The next shipment should arrive in # [minute/minutes] (Earth time).
11053 : Obtained key item: # %!

11061 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for %!
11062 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for the %!

11071 : A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
11072 : Brought me voiddust, have you? This will take but an instant... And, as promised, here is your voidstone! Do not let it go to waste.
11073 : Brought me voiddust, have you? This will take but an instant... And, as promised, here is your voidstone! Do not let it go to waste.
11074 : It pains me to inform you that you cannot carry any more voidstones. Please hold on to that voiddust until your supply has been depleted.
11075 : How many do you need? (Cruor: #) None, thank you. One (# cruor). Three (# cruor). Six (# cruor). Nine (# cruor). Twelve (# cruor).

11086 : Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.
11087 : Those who possess % may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused. Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.
11088 : Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
11089 : I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
11090 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Have stratum abyssite examined. Request teleportation. Analyze atmacite. Ask about atmacite. Ask about atmacite enrichment.
11091 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.
11092 : Infuse which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) Previous page. Next page.
11093 : Infusing the % (lv.#) requires # cruor.
11094 : Infuse % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
11095 : You do not have enough cruor.
11096 : [Infuse/Purge] which atmacite? None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#)
11097 : Purge % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
11098 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with % (lv.#)!
11099 : The atmacite could not be infused...
11100 : % has been purged of the % (lv.#).
11101 : % purges the % (lv.#), infusing % (lv.#) in its place. (Cruor expended: #)
11102 : You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.
11103 : Enrich which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # Previous page. Next page.
11104 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
11105 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
11106 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
11107 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
11108 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
11109 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11110 : The atmacite could not be purged...
11111 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
11112 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
11113 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
11114 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
11115 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11116 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
11117 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
11118 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
11119 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
11120 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
11121 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
11122 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
11123 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
11124 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
11125 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
11126 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
11127 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
11128 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
11129 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
11130 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
11131 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
11132 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
11133 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
11134 : Your % has evolved into %!
11135 : Supply me with the # cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.
