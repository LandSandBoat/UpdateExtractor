6987 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
6988 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
6989 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
6990 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6991 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
6992 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?
6993 : [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
6994 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
6995 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
6996 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
6997 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6998 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6999 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7000 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7001 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7002 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7003 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7004 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7005 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7006 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7007 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7008 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7009 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7010 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7011 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7012 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7013 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7014 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7015 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7016 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7017 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7018 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7019 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7020 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7021 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7022 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7023 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7024 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7025 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7026 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7027 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7028 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7029 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7030 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7031 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7032 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7033 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7034 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7035 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7036 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7037 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7038 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7039 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7040 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7041 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7042 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7043 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7044 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7045 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7046 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7047 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7048 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7049 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7050 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]
7051 : Ready? I'm taking my shot!
7052 : Keep your eyes open! You don't wanna miss this!
7053 : I see an opening. Get ready to follow up.
7054 : Are you ready? I'm beginning my attack!
7055 : I'm going to attack! Are you ready?
7056 : Keep your eyes peeled! I'm going in for the big one!
7057 : Are preparations in order, [sir/milady]? Then, I shall proceed with my offensive.
7058 : I'm warmed up now. Time for a real attack!
7059 : Don't blink now! Follow my lead!
7060 : Are you ready? I'm taking my shot!
7061 : Alrighty! Here goes nothing!
7062 : Are you ready? I'm beginning my attack!
7063 : I'm going in, so get ready! No slipping up!
7064 : It's my turrrn! Get ready to pounce after me!

7079 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
7080 : So far, we've only taken down # [enemy/enemies] today!
7081 : How many enemies have we defeated? Only #. You can count that high, right...?
7082 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
7083 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
7084 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
7085 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7086 : We've only beaten # [enemy/enemies] so far. Don't tell me you're tired already!?
7087 : Only # [enemy has/enemies have] fallen to us today! We're just getting started!
7088 : The last enemy we defeated was number #.
7089 : The last enemy we took down was number #.
7090 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
7091 : Only # [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
7092 : We've beaten at least two...right?
7093 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
7094 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
7095 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...
7096 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7097 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7098 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7099 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7100 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7101 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7102 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7103 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7104 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7105 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7106 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7107 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7108 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7109 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7110 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7111 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7112 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7113 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7114 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7115 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7116 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7117 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7118 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7119 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7120 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7249 : The Mana Orb in this receptacle is not broken.
7250 : You have already examined this receptacle.
7251 : ...But everyone else says the same thing, Brother! Why, oh why, won't you listen to what I'm trying to tell you?
7252 : At long last, we've achieved peace. Why risk destroying it?
7253 : Behind your backy-wacky, some people say that you're setting out to start a war!
7254 : What's more, you know that this laboratory in the Horutoto Ruins is off-limits...?
7255 : Whataru do they know!?
7256 : And you, Apururu, my own sistaru...! Can'taru you see the truth behind all of this?
7257 : Why do you think they all fear war, but won't lift a finger-winger to do anything about it?
7258 : They all say that Windurst has peace and security, peace and security, but do you really-weally think our country has peace?
7259 : The wounds the Orastery received from the war haven't healed, even after twenty-odd years. The best of the War Warlock mages are dying off, unable to train new, younger replacementarus.
7260 : Just imagine what would happen if war broke out again. Windurst would be obliterated in an instantaru. That's why...that's why we need some grand new magic...
7261 : But what about the Star Sibyl...?
7262 : Yes, and what about her...? What was the reason she forbade the very magic I seek? If they could have controlled that magic properly, then we wouldn't have had to buddy-buddy with the beastmen in the first place!
7263 : Sure, the spell-weaver died, but the magic itself was a great success...
7264 : Only you, my dear brother, would call such a great tragedy a success...
7265 : The Mastermind of the Millennium met such a tragic fate...so what chance would a faker-waker genius like you stand, Ajido-Marujido?
7266 : Humph. Say whataru you like. A genius is never accepted by the world in his own time. If you've just come here to whinge and whine, then off with you! Go on, getaru!
7267 : Well, I've tried my hardest to convince you... Now I don't care what happens to you anymore, Brother!
7268 : Don't come crying to me if you get yourself killed!
7269 : Oi! Who's that over there?
7270 : Ah...? What's thataru, you say? A wanna-be newbie adventurer, huh? So you're the one they sent to help me with my experiment...?
7271 : Well, you're too latey-watey! The experiment is over. This gizmo just broke down again...
7272 : And then my pesky little sistaru wandered on in just to add insult to injury!
7273 : Phew... Well, I've had enough for one day. I'm headed home. Seeing as you've come all this way, I'd hate for you to go home empty-handed, so here's a little job for you.
7274 : On your way here, you probably noticed the glowing receptacle gizmos here and there, didn'taru you? Well, inside each of them, there's a magical ball called a Mana Orb.
7275 : I think one of those Mana Orbs was broken when my experiment failed just now. Your job is to find the broken sphere and take it back to the Orastery.
7276 : Oh, and one more thing... Don't go blabbing about what you just heard here, all rightaru?
7277 : The door is firmly closed.
7278 : It looks like that Cat Burglar's hideout lies behind this door! You were able to confirm %!
7279 : % confirmed!
7280 : Ha ha ha hah...
7281 : Thank you for kindly coming all this way to carry out our little trrransaction.
7282 : This is what you're going to do... Drrrop all the money and equipment you have on you, then get the hell out of here.
7283 : Heh heh heh... Don't tell us this is yourrr first lesson in the school of hard knocks now, little [girrrl/boy]?
7284 : Hah! Perrrhaps you should consider this as your tuition fee? You see, we intended to use that book as bait...to lurrre unsuspecting do-gooders like yourself into our little trap.
7285 : Hurry up and drop all yourrr belongings! You don't want to keep me waiting!
7286 : Huh...?
7287 : The extinguished magic is our lord!
7288 : The slumbering strength is our ruler!
7289 : We have found you, Mithra! Return the lifeforce of our leader back to us!
7290 : Grrr... This is bad!
7291 : What do we do, Top Cat? We can't take on three Ace Carrrdians and expect to live!
7292 : You tricked us... You stole from us... Many important things, you did!
7293 : They were our lord's belongings! They were our ruler's possessions!
7294 : It is not permissible for living fools such as you to take the property of the deceased...!
7295 : So, Mithra... Tell us where you hid our ruler's belongings! If you do not want to join him in death, then you had best speak the truth!
7296 : Alrrright, I'll tell you then... All you wish to know is their wherrreabouts, right?
7297 : The boxes you seek are hidden in the old summoner's rrresidence in Windurst Walls...the House of the Hero.
7298 : Now that I've told you, you can stop chasing us around, alrrright?
7299 : ......
7300 : ......
7301 : ...... You appear to be telling the truth.
7302 : Of course I'm telling the trrruth. I know only too well that you Carrrdians can detect when someone is lying!
7303 : Then you also know that we are incapable of lying as well.
7304 : We will be returning to town... After we have silenced you forever!
7305 : Why, you double-crrrossing...
7306 : This time you've gone too far!
7307 : When you cannot lie, you must value your words as much as your life!
7308 : It is the Minister of the Orastery...! Ajido-Marujido...!
7309 : So, Cardians of the Dark, you have already investigatarued me, have you? Dare I ask what evil enterprise you are planning?
7310 : Don'taru tell me that you are after the forbidden magic as well? That couldn't possibly be true, could it?
7311 : ......
7312 : Humph. They cannot lie, but they can keep their silence! I underestimatarued them!
7313 : So, now I see... You stole that book from our Cardian friends there, eh?
7314 : But to hide it and your other spoils right under our noses in ol' Karaha-Baruha's residence...? I guess you could say that the darkestaru place is always under the candlestick.
7315 : You can leave the rest to me. Give me the key to the House of the Hero. I'm talking about Karaha-Baruha's ring. I know you've gotaru it!
7316 : You know that the second you lay hands on those boxes, the Carrrdians are going to go after you, don't you?
7317 : Well, I suppose if it means an end to being tailed by those crrreepy Carrrdians and you, my pesky little man, then it is a small prrrice to pay.
7318 : You have the gall to think I enjoy playing cat and mouse, running around after you, do you? Really, now...?
7319 : As for you, adventurer, get out of here while you still can. Otherwise, you'll have a cat in hell's chance of escaping with your belongings intact.
7320 : Next stop, ol' Karaha-Baruha's residence! I had better hurry back to Windurst Walls before it's too late...
7321 : Your % disappears in a flash of light.
7322 : Do not come any closer!
7323 : Go back from where you came!
7324 : Hey... Are you okay?
7325 : You seem to be all rightaru...
7326 : The Cardians here are very different from the Cardians in town.
7327 : You'll be sorry if you carelessly go anywhere near these guys.
7328 : You see, these are my old man's most powerful creations. The ones he practically worked himself to death over.
7329 : (But, seeing as these Cardians are still up and running about, it must mean that my old man is still alive somewhere...)
7330 : Anyway, what the devil-wevil are you doing in this room?
7331 : These guys are protectaruing a part of the talisman that seals away the Shadow Lord...and that's no ordinary seal! Only the ministers of the five ministries are allowed to enter this room!
7332 : What's that you say...? The great Star Sibyl has collapsed? What terrifying portent did she see in the stars, then...?
7333 : What in the stars is going on? I had better go check with my own eyes. Better head down to Full Moon Fountain...
7334 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
7335 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7336 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7337 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7345 : This chest is locked. It can be opened with %.

7356 : You cannot open the chest when you are in a weakened state.
7357 : The chest was a mimic!
7358 : You cannot open the chest while participating in the moogle event.
7359 : The chest was but an illusion...
7360 : The chest appears to be locked. If only you had %, perhaps you could open it...
7361 : Your % disappears in a flash of light!
7362 : What might-ethy this be?
7363 : Yes. What is this?
7364 : Why, it didily-doodily looks like it's didily-dried up.
7365 : You imbeciles! This is a new bud--a bud of the Great Star Tree.
7366 : The Great Star Tree knows-ethy that it is in danger. It buds to save-ethy itself, it does.
7367 : But, until now, no light shone-ethy in here. The bud cried for help-ethy. It is good that we got-ethy here in time.
7368 : I thank-ethy you, adventurer. You saved-ethy the Great Star Tree!
7369 : I followed-a-roo, thinking that my sweetie-pie Mojiji was all trap-dappily trapped up in here. What a waste of timely-time.
7370 : Well, I'm just about as disappointed as one could be. I thought we would be finding something goody.
7371 : Those two... When will they ever change-ethy...
7372 : But to be so weak to know-ethy it's in danger... This is definitely-ethy a serious problem.
7373 : ...Beep...
7374 : ...Beeeep! Beeeep! Beeeep!
7375 : ...Detected... Unclassifiable magic source... ...Location... Sealed area...
7376 : Contact manufacturer...
7377 : ...Detected... Unclassifiable magic source... ...Location... Behind door...
7378 : Contact manufacturer...
7379 : ...
7380 : This door could probably be opened by Apururu with her %...
7381 : I'm sorry I'm late.
7382 : Okay, here goes. %, keep a look out!
7383 : My dear brother!
7384 : Uh...? ...You... Is this a dream?
7385 : Ajido-Marujido, are you all rightaru!? This is no dream! Please wake up!
7386 : Not a dream, huh...? It feels like I've been trapped in a never-ending nightmare...
7387 : The bearer of darkness was here... He said he was searching for something... He seemed to be...in pain...
7388 : The bearer of darkness? What are you talking about?
7389 : What is that? I sense a mysterious force nearby... What is that you're carrying?
7390 : Are you kidding me? One of the ancients returned the magic to this tome?
7391 : That's just ludicrous...! But still, this level of power... It's most definitely...
7392 : That book... Could it be...!
7393 : Ajido-Marujido, no!
7394 : Ajido-Marujido!!!
7395 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7396 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7397 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7398 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7399 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7400 : Now, listen close...
7401 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7402 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7403 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7404 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7405 : .........listen......
