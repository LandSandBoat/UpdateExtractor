6612 : We've been through a good number of enemies. One more ought to do it.
6613 : I think I'm finally getting tired. Should we make the next battle our last?
6614 : We've done enough today, I think. Let's make the next battle our last.
6615 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6616 : <Puff, wheeze> Just one more battle, okay?
6617 : I'm starting to feel sorry for our opponents! Think I'll call it a day after the next one.
6618 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6619 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6620 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6621 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6622 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6623 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6624 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6625 : I'm sooo tirrred...

6632 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6633 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6634 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6635 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6636 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6637 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6638 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6639 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6640 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6641 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.

6673 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6674 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6675 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6676 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6677 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6678 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6679 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6680 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6681 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6682 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6683 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!

6690 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6691 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6692 : I'm fine...really.
6693 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6694 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6695 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6696 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6697 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6698 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.
6699 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.

6706 : Let's take a break, shall we? No sense rushing into battle in this condition.
6707 : I need to take a break soon.
6708 : Hey, how about taking five?
6709 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6710 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6711 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6712 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6713 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6722 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6723 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6724 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6725 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6726 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6727 : Please... I need to sit down...

6842 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6843 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6844 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6845 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6846 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6847 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6848 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6849 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6850 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6851 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6852 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6853 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6854 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6855 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6856 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6857 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6858 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6859 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6860 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6861 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6862 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6863 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6864 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6865 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6866 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6867 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6868 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6869 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6870 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6871 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6872 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6873 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6874 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6875 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6876 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6877 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6878 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6879 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6880 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6881 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6882 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6883 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6884 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6885 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6886 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6887 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6888 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6889 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6890 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!

7370 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7371 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7379 : You already possess the gate crystal for this telepoint.
7380 : The telepoint has disappeared...
7381 : Investigate the missing telepoint? Let's see here... Not right now.
7382 : You have investigated the [Holla/Dem/Mea/Altepa/Yhoator/Vahzl] telepoint.
7383 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7384 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7385 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7386 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7387 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7388 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7389 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7390 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7391 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7392 : You've earned conquest points!
7393 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7394 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7395 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7396 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7397 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7398 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7399 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7400 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7401 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7402 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7403 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7404 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7405 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7406 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7407 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7408 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7409 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7410 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7411 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7412 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7413 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7414 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7415 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7416 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7417 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7418 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7419 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7420 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7421 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7422 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7423 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7424 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7425 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7426 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7427 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7428 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7429 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?

7431 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
7432 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
7433 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
7434 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
7435 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
7436 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
7437 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.

7441 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
7442 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
7443 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.

7447 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
7448 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.

7466 : Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!

7468 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
7469 : I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
7470 : I can teleport you to your home country for # gil or # conquest [point/points].
7471 : Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered.  Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
7472 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
7473 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
7474 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
7475 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
7476 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.

7489 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
7490 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
7491 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
7492 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
7493 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
7494 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
7495 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
7496 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
7497 : There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
7498 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.
7499 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
7500 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
7501 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
7502 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
7503 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
7504 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
7505 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...

7515 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
7516 : You received # conquest points!
7517 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
7518 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
7519 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
7520 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
7521 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
7522 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
7523 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
7524 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
7525 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
7526 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
7527 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
7528 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
7529 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
7530 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
7531 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
7532 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
7533 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
7723 : PAUSE
7725 : Only shards of ice lie upon the ground.
7726 : You can hear blocks of ice moving from deep within the cave.
7727 : How many millennia has this snow been here, hidden from the rays of the sun?
7728 : You bury the % in the snow. It will take some time for it to become purified.
7729 : The % you buried is not yet purified.
7730 : The % you buried has become purified! Something is engraved on the ring, but you cannot read it.
7731 : %!
7732 : Why have you come? You don't need to be here.
7733 : This is a drrreadful land. A place where even a person alone can barely sneak through.
7734 : That someone could be living in this accursed, godforsaken place is difficult to believe...
7735 : Only, I found this on one of the monsters from around here.
7736 : It's a broken arrow, but it glows strangely in a way that I have never seen in Windurst, or anywhere else for that matter.
7737 : This arrow may have been loosed from the Bow of Light... Which means the Bow of Light would also be here somewhere...
7738 : In any case, I must get closer to Castle Zvahl. Take care of yourself, %.
7739 : %, do you find anything strrrange about that cave?
7740 : I can't imagine that anyone would be in there, but still, there's something... I feel some sort of prrresence from within.
7741 : ...!
7742 : Who's there!?
7743 : ...This arrow, an azurrre arrow...
7744 : You were sent by Perih Vashai?
7745 : I am Semih Lafihna, Sibyl Guard of Windurst!
7746 : That voice...we are of the same tribe!? If you're not an enemy, then show yourself!
7747 : ...... Semih Lafihna...
7748 : ...!? ...You, you're...!?
7749 : Yes. I am the daughter of Nhev Befrathi, the Fire Tribe chieftainness. I am Syu Befrathi.
7750 : The daughter of...!? You were supposed to have died twenty years ago!
7751 : Perih Vashai arranged it so that I could escape. She said that if I could make it as far as this place, the Mithran Tracker would not be able to follow.
7752 : Come inside. It is not safe to talk here...
7753 : ...I will tell you what you wish to know. First, let me speak of the Bow of Light...
7754 : The Bow of Light is famous for its powerrr, but was not originally the weapon carried by the chieftainness of our tribe.
7755 : It was something that Yow Rabntah found in this forsaken land and brought back to the tribe thirty years ago. ...No, what she actually brought back was the large gem that was to be embedded in the bow's shaft.
7756 : Yow Rabntah used the stone to create the Bow of Light, a weapon even more powerrrful than the chieftainness's Bow of Flames.
7757 : The bow did not bring light as was intended. It was a bow that stole the light from my people...
7758 : My mother, the chieftainness, insisted the bow be taken back to where it belonged. It carried with it the taint of this accursed place, and would surely have brought rrruin upon the tribe.
7759 : The tribespeople, however, were already divided over whether to keep the bow.
7760 : And then something terrible happened. A fiendish creature appeared before Yow Rabntah, almost as if the gem had called to it.
7761 : She was slain by the fiend...and my mother was disgraced by her inability to averrrt the tragedy.
7762 : Thirty years ago...Yow Rabntah... She was a member of the team sent to investigate this area, wasn't she?
7763 : Yes, you're rrright. It wasn't until ten years after my mother was imprisoned that we discovered the fiend was actually the Shadow Lord.
7764 : When she learned of this, my mother escaped from her prison and headed for the Northlands. As the Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe, she sought to exact rrrevenge for her people.
7765 : ...... She was captured by the Yagudo before she reached her destination...
7766 : ...Yes. But I will carry out her rrrevenge.
7767 : I have returned with the gem, the magicite taken by Yow Rabntah, to purify this accursed land.
7768 : ...... ...You will never accomplish that alone.
7769 : ...This is true. But you are Mithra; you should understand. We are one with nature, and cannot ignore her call for help.
7770 : I have rrresolved to spend my remaining days in this land, a land abandoned by the Mithra hundreds of years ago.
7771 : ......
7772 : Do not concern yourself with my safety. I have survived here for twenty years...
7773 : I have been more worried about you. When Perih Vashai brought sin upon herself by letting me escape, you would also be held accountable...
7774 : It seems the Mithran Tracker didn't explain that part to you.
7775 : I would be...? What did you just say?
7776 : Please take this. It is the Bow of Light with the magicite rrremoved. If you give this to the Tracker, everything should be rrresolved.
7777 : Take this % also. It is the one given to me by Perih Vashai to disguise my identity.
7778 : All will become clear when you unite it with the % that you carry.
7779 : ...It matches!
7780 : My mother and I...we owe you and your mother our eternal gratitude. Goodbye, Semih Lafihna.
7781 : Was there something else?
7782 : A letter from Koh Lenbalalako!? There's a name I haven't heard in yearrrs...
7783 : Thank you, adventurer. I wish for you to have these.
7784 : The cavern continues on for quite a distance.
7785 : There is nothing more to be done here.
7786 : Roar!
7787 : Grrroar!
7788 : Grrrgroooar! Grrrgroooarrr!

7794 : Happy-wappy New Year to you, [sir/ma'am]! And apparently...commiserations!
7795 : Happy-wappy New Year to you, [sir/ma'am]! And apparently...a strong tiger has appeared in the north!
7796 : Oooh, you're sure to like this! He says, Beforrre me stands a person-werson who'll be swimming in fantarustic forrrtune this year!
7797 : Oooh, nice! He says, You're going be in for a grrreataru year with oodles of elation!
7798 : That was, Justaru the rrright amount of happiness is going to be coming your way!
7799 : That translates to, You win some, you lose some. But on the whole, there's no rrreason-weason why you should be pessimistic!
7800 : Uh-oh! That was, You'll need to dig deepy-weep for some luck of your own this yearrr!
7801 : Hrrrm... Rather than interpretaru that, let me just say, whatever happens this year, always rememberrr to keep your chinny-win up!
7802 : A fabulous-wabulous yearrr to you, adventurer!
7803 : Grrr... (Boy, it sure looks hungry.)
7804 : Grrr...Grrr... (It doesn't look like that was enough.)
7805 : Grrr! Grrr! Roar! (It looks quite satisfied.)
7806 : Yo, you over there! It's me, Fablinix, the Duke of Fab! I'll get ya a little somethin' special if ya give me %.
7807 : I's lovin' myself some %!
7808 : A promise from Fab is worth its weight in gil! So come back when y'got % and Fab'll do somethin' super-special fer ya!
7809 : Y'brought Fab %, so now come back wit' %. Fab'll do somethin' super-special for ya!
7810 : 'Tis a promise. But ya ain't need worry yerself about the details. Just a li'l Goblin magic!
7811 : Y'brought me %! Now Fab'll make it into something special, jus' like he promised!
7812 : If'n ya bring Fab %, he'll turn it inta somethin' better'n before!
7813 : Bring Fab %--he'll greatenize it fer ya!
7814 : You receive 99 %!
7815 : The [orange/1/2/3/red/red/blue/blue/yellow/yellow/green/green/indigo/indigo/violet/violet] light... I can feel its power run through me.
7816 : Come, %.  Follow me...
7817 : Carbuncle vanished off in the direction of the La Theine Plateau.
7818 : Carbuncle vanished off to another area in the La Theine Plateau.
7819 : The % jumps in your hands.
7820 : Ahahahahaha! I can sense the power of the ring! Get yourself moving [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7821 : Ahahahahaha! Don't slow down now, slacker! The readings are coming from the [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7822 : Ahahahahaha! You're getting close now! I can feel the ring's power from the next area!
7823 : Ahahahahaha! You're almost on top of it! It's somewhere in this area!

7866 : % and % cannot be used here.
7867 : %... Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to. The time left to me is short.
7868 : Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...
7869 : I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me... It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...
7870 : Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.
7871 : A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.
7872 : My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully. Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.
7873 : Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world. You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete. My hopes go with you, %.
7874 : There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.
7875 : There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.
7876 : The strands of grass here have been tied together.
7877 : There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.
7878 : I see you have met with Raogrimm. His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.
7879 : In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.
7880 : You will need the %, a key that bridges the void between Vana'diel and that other world.
7881 : It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The % is one of those items.
7882 : You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the %. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...
7883 : That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.
7884 : Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.
7885 : The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.
7886 : We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.
7887 : Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the % to guide you...
7888 : I never believed that my indifference to the state of other nations would cause harm to my beloved San d'Oria...
7889 : As part of my penance, I will infuse the % with what guidance I can.
7890 : I betrayed him... And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...
7891 : Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...
7892 : I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
7893 : Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.
7894 : Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord... This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.
7895 : Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
7896 : Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.
7897 : I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.
7898 : Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.
7899 : Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this %! Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
7900 : There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.
7901 : There is a symbol carved into the rock here.
7902 : I have been waiting for you.
7903 : Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"... Do you understand the significance of these words?
7904 : When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form... Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.
7905 : Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...
7906 : The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.
7907 : Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard.  The next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.
7908 : You must obtain the last trophy. All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.
7909 : Take care, my brave adventurer. May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
7910 : Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning. This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.
7911 : I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death. Is this what they call karma...?
7912 : This land has borne the weight of my sins. I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...
7913 : So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed... Keep your wits aboutaru you, %.
7914 : I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes. Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.
7915 : It is time! Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, %. %! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
7916 : Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a prison of souls.
7917 : Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened. Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...
7918 : It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?
7919 : There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.
7920 : Please pay no mind to my ramblings. You have secured the %. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.
7921 : You will need four such trophies. Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.
7922 : I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...
7923 : Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.
7924 : It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities. If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...
7925 : %. This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.
7926 : When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there. That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.
7927 : What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge. But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...
7928 : That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...
7929 : Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry! I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.
7930 : Now, %. This % is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.
7931 : Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, %. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...
7932 : The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.
7933 : I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.
7934 : Wait, wait, wait! I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but... How can I explain it?
7935 : Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.
7936 : But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order! You've got your paws on the %! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.
7937 : But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.
7938 : % and the four trophies. These artifacts have long been lost to that other world.  The Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.
7939 : It must have been in the time of the Great War... Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.
7940 : Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.
7941 : The % and the %. Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms. Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...
7942 : Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way. However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...
7943 : Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...
7944 : Is it over...?
7945 : No, the rage has merely been dispersed.
7946 : As long as I exist, he will never truly die...
7947 : Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?
7948 : %... You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented. I have not the words to express my gratitude.
7949 : The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more. I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...
7950 : The one who holds sway...?
7951 : Yes. From the center of infinite darkness. I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...
7952 : You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell. The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.
7953 : It was an error in judgment to shelter you... The order of my realm has been disrupted.
7954 : I give to you a duty... You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.
7955 : No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul. No return to the land of blessed light...
7956 : What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness? As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.
7957 : Of one thing I was certain. This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.
7958 : A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.
7959 : Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow. It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.
7960 : Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey. Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.
7961 : %, you may be the one to witness this truth.
7962 : The power stored in the % will soon be drained. And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.
7963 : Do not forget who you are, %. I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.
7964 : My old companions...?
7965 : This duty is too much for just one to bear. If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived. It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.
7966 : That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.
7967 : Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis? I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.
7968 : Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm. I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.
7969 : C'mon, let's see a little excitement! This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.
7970 : It's not the Northlands this time. None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?
7971 : I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain. Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.
7972 : I thought this would be the end of you for sure... Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.
7973 : What, no words for an old friend? Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?
7974 : I betrayed you! I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia! The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!
7975 : Everything began thirty years ago. And there were things that came to an end... Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.
7976 : And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.
7977 : I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions. No matter who that person may be.
7978 : Raogrimm...
7979 : Are you sure you want to do this? This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land. As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...
7980 : Raogrimm. There is no need to suffer alone anymore. Our presence here should answer your question.
7981 : There are crimes that must be atoned for. And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.
7982 : Until the dawn of an age without hatred... No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.
7983 : Cornelia...
7986 : There is a strange symbol drawn here. A haunting chill sweeps through you as you gaze upon it...
7987 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Present the %...if you wish to pass into...my dream.
7988 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: The sands of time yet fall... Present the...%.
7989 : I am the ruler of Dynamis.
7990 : Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs? Either way, this is not your dream.
7991 : The dreamer of this realm is a separate entity than he who dreamt of that wasteland of malice, Xarcabard.
7992 : Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?
7993 : I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.
7994 : While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.
7995 : The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.
7996 : Search for my counterpart, and unite this realm with your own dream.
7997 : A nightmare curses this land yet again.
7998 : Take heed, dream traveler.
7999 : I have been watching your dream.
8000 : But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there. This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.
8001 : You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.
8002 : I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...
8003 : The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.
8004 : Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place... The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.

8060 : These young patricians are quite spirited, but they lack valuable battle experience.
8061 : While we need be cautious not to disgrace their family names, we cannot let them fall in battle. We request your assistance in protecting the future of San d'Oria!
8062 : It will not be long before a caravan of traders in search of new trade routes arrives here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].

8065 : Ah, but perhaps this could be a perfect chance to show those pampered sissies that being a true knight comprises more than just chasing about shoplifters and sweeping the chateau gardens. However, no matter how much of a grudge we may hold, we cannot let our Elvaan brothers and sisters fall in battle. Understood?
8066 : In a matter of moments, members of the Royal Guards will be arriving here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare us for our next campaign against the beastmen.
8067 : If the fiends are conniving a surprise attack, I expect you to do your best in assuring that no disgrace will be brought upon the guards' names, as well as preventing any unnecessary bloodshed.
8068 : Today, our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] is blessed with the honor of welcoming an ambassador from the fine Republic of Bastok.

8071 : However, within their ranks are future scientists and craftsmen. Their deaths would be a great loss for the future of our nation.
8072 : We must ensure their safety, but we also must be careful not to prevent them from fulfilling their duties. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8073 : In a matter of minutes, a group of mariners will be arriving at our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] for self-defense training.

8078 : If anything were to happen to the commanders, you and I would both be court-martialed! The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8079 : I have just received word that a group of ambassadors from the Federation of Windurst is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe what measures Bastok has undertaken to maintain stability in the regions under Republican control.

8081 : Shortly, we will be conducting a test for our mercenary candidates here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8082 : This exam is to help us judge the candidates' skill in battle and help us separate those with talent from those who are bound for deskwork.
8083 : But after an attack by the beastmen...there won't be any candidates left to grade! You've got to help us give these kids a fighting chance!
8084 : It won't be long before a party of Federation scholars will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to do research on the local wildlife.
8085 : These scientists are more powerful with their pens than their swords...but that won't help them against a beastman attack! You've got to help us protect them!
8086 : Hmmm... Later today, a small group of Wize Wizards will be arriving to observe our daily work here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8087 : I say that we give them something to remember! %! It's up to you to prove to those bigwigs that we are the ones who maintain the peace in the Federation! Give those beastmen all you've got! (Just don't let the Wize Wizards get hurt...)
8088 : Today, a party of Federation Patriarchs is scheduled to arrive at the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to plan for Windurst's next campaign against the beastmen.
8089 : If anything were to happen to them, we'd all be reassigned to latrine duty! If you know what's good for you, you won't let anyone lay a finger on them!
8090 : Oh, why did the military attachs from San d'Oria have to come to our outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] now?
8091 : I shudder to think what would happen if an ambassador was injured...or worse! Get out there and protect those Elvaan with your life!
8092 : Excellent work! Your efforts helped protect the future of our nation. Divide this among your companions.
8093 : Our nation suffered an enormous loss today. We must begin reinforcing our defenses immediately!
8094 : Your inability to complete the mission has led to our defeat. The last thing our nation needs is an incompetent adventurer!
8095 : You fought hard, and you proved yourself worthy. You are a great asset to the nation.
8096 : We commend you on your services in helping us avert the beastmen's attack. I do not see them attacking us again any time soon.
8097 : This area is currently conducting a Ballista match. I have no time to trouble myself with your beastman trinkets.
8098 : A party member has an NPC called up. You cannot take part in this event.
8099 : You find nothing of interest.
8100 : Today is your lucky day!
8101 : If you stick with your lucky color, you sense your fortunes will change for the better.
8102 : %! A most pleasant surprise to see you again!
8103 : Schultz!? But you're supposed to be... You haven't aged a day!
8104 : What's that? Oh, you didn't think that I...
8105 : Oh, don't be ridiculous. I simply feigned my death using a classic magical technique. An old favorite of mine.
8106 : The ensuing chaos certainly was most entertaining.  I sure do wish that you could have been there to see it with your own eyes.
8107 : <Sigh>... That takes me back. That must have been...what? Some twenty years ago, if I'm not mistaken.
8108 : Oh, I do beg your pardon. I suppose for you it feels as though all of this occurred no more in the past than yesterday.
8109 : Well, that's enough reminiscing for now.
8110 : It's high time we charge you with your first test, and last as it were, as a scholar of the Schultz School.
8111 : I must ascertain for myself whether you are worthy of bearing the title Herald of the Grimoire. That is to say, whether or not you are worthy of being the one to champion our school's legacy.
8112 : Have a look, there. You see?
8113 : Written before you is what is known as a formula of porting.
8114 : You may recall like formulations from your studies. This one, however, differs from convention in one regard.
8115 : It has been formulated in a manner that will allow it to act in concert with %. It falls upon you, %, to find one.
8116 : Should you locate %, all that remains is to raise it ahigh, and the formula will carry you to the royal tomb. It is there where I shall be waiting.
8117 : Be sure not to keep your teacher waiting, %. Until our next lesson, then.
8118 : The formula of porting has been laid out. After securing %, it should transport you to the royal tomb.
8119 : The % is torn...

11414 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11415 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
11416 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
11417 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
11418 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
11419 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
11420 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
11421 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
11422 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
11423 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
11424 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
11425 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
11426 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
11427 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
11428 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
11429 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
11430 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
11431 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
11432 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
11433 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
11434 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
11435 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
11436 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!

11439 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there, kupo!
11440 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
11441 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
11442 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
11443 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
11444 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
11445 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
11446 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
11447 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
11448 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
11449 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
11450 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
11451 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
11452 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
11453 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
11455 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
11456 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
11457 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
11458 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
11459 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
11460 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
11461 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
11462 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
11463 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
11464 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
11465 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

11512 : <Ahem>! %, I presume.
11513 : Well met, good [sir/madam]. My name is Alberic, and I have the pleasure of being Joachim's compatriot from Abyssea.
11514 : As I am pressed for time, you must forgive me for forgoing pleasantries.
11515 : The Northlands of our two worlds are not dissimilar: they both are shrouded in mystery and held in trepidation by folk.
11516 : That you now stand before this cavernous maw, % in hand, is silent affirmation of your intent.
11517 : Firstly, you would do well to remember that the portal, despite its location in Xarcabard, leads in fact to the Uleguerand Range.
11518 : Reports suggest that such maws exiting into alternate locales are not altogether uncommon, although the scientific explanation for this phenomenon eludes our researchers still.
11519 : For our intents and purposes, however, such matters are of small import.
11520 : The problems that want for our solving are far more urgent and dire in nature.
11521 : The Uleguerand Range... 'Twould be no exaggeration to call that place a frozen hell on Abyssea. There, 'tis as if nature herself desires the eradication of mankind.
11522 : The strength your folk possess is fabled among my people. Nevertheless, one can never be too prudent when one's life is at stake. I urge you to practice due caution as you traverse Uleguerand's white fields of death.
11523 : In particular, you would do well to stay on constant alert for a grotesquely overlarge diremite.
11524 : Of a size to dwarf its cousins, this vermin has a spine-chilling relish for man-flesh. Needless to say, this predilection is proving to be highly unfortunate for folk who subsist in the range.
11525 : All efforts to slay the savage fiend have thus far proven fruitless...and costly. To compound matters, the difficult terrain hinders our attempts to devise effective strategies. Be ever wary out there, %, lest you be caught unawares by this nightmare creature.
11526 : Hmm, 'twould appear my visit is at an end. I must needs return to Abyssea.
11527 : I pray that the heavens shall grant us another meeting. Fare you well.
11528 : Ah, the hero of the hour makes [his/her] triumphant return!
11529 : Reports reached me but moments ago of your epic victory over the menace of Uleguerand. Of your people's exceptional strength I was well aware, but you truly shine above the rest.
11530 : Now the souls of my comrades who fell to the vile beast may rest in peace. My boundless gratitude is yours, %.
11531 : I should be honored if you would accept this gift.
11532 : Consider it a small token of my gratitude.
11533 : %, 'tis called.
11534 : An uncommon variety of the stone, 'tis known to unleash its full potential when wielded by a native of your world. It should serve you well in the battles to come.
11535 : Your valorous deed has allowed hope to take root again within the barren snowfields of Uleguerand. Yet our journey to salvation is far from over.
11536 : The great cataclysm tore across the land as steel rips through flesh, deeply scarring our world and the hearts of those who call it home.
11537 : The wound I bear within bleeds to this day, yet I continue to fight in the hopes that the suffering can be ended.
11538 : In this age of unending torment, many are those who hurl curses at the heavens for what they regard as abandonment. I, for one, believe that man has always shaped his own destiny, and must continue to do so.
11539 : The fate of my home world shall not be one of destruction, this I solemnly vow. Even should my body turn to dust, I shall fight on.
11540 : Countless mysteries remain unsolved, yet one thing is clear: the people of Abyssea cannot survive without the aid of you and yours. I beseech you, %. Stand with us in our darkest hour.
