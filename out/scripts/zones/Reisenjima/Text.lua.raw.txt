6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7326 : You have ventured too far from the field of battle. The Confrontation will automatically disengage if you do not return.
7327 : You have ventured too far from the field of battle. The Confrontation has been disengaged.

7331 : You have only # [second/seconds] (Earth time) remaining.
7332 : Your time for this Confrontation is up...
7333 : The monster fades before your eyes, a look of disappointment on its face.
7334 : (Test message.)
7335 : Enter the garrison? Yes. No.
7336 : The % is ripped violently to pieces!
7337 : Greetings, fair traveler. My people would entreat thy assistance, and offer rich reward in return. Thou shouldst speak with my sister Callisto, who abides in Grauberg's Witchfire Glen.
7338 : Hark! Our foe lurks thither. How wouldst thou proceed?
7339 : How will you proceed? Withdraw. Charge in. Scout the enemy. Check weapon.
7340 : Our foe advances...may thine aim be true!
7341 : I have been observing our foe closely from my post. It appears that [it remains but a fledgling./its strength is on the wane./it has only begun to realize its true strength./its strength is burgeoning by the day./it has reached the pinnacle of its power.]
7342 : My sisters are monitoring the strength of our enemies throughout the realm. By your leave, I shall share with thee their findings.

7347 : The % thou hast entrusted to our keeping can endure only # more enchantments. Thenceforth, it shall be rendered useless. Pray be wary!
7348 : Greetings, traveler! How dost thou fare in thine adventures?
7349 : By my troth, what a thrilling battle! When thou landed the felling blow, a shiver ran down my wings! As promised, here is thy reward.
7350 : Dost thou find this enchantment to thy liking?
7351 : Accept the item? Accept. Refuse. (# times remaining)
7352 : Splendid! May it serve thee well.
7353 : % obtained %!
7354 : Ah, 'tis unfortunate. Sadly, my folk are not well-versed in the penchants of adventurers these days...
7355 : In that event, we shall prepare thy weapon to be enchanted anew. May thou be once more triumphant in battle anon!
7356 : What's this? 'Twould appear that thy weapon can endure no further enchantments.
7357 : Though it may fall short of thy expectations, pray accept it.
7358 : Otherwise, we shall have no choice but to dispose of it.
7359 : Many thanks for thine assistance!
7360 : Pray accept this % as but a humble token of our gratitude.
7366 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7367 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7368 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7369 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7370 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7371 : Now, listen close...
7372 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7373 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7374 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7375 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7376 : .........listen......
7377 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7378 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7379 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. Darkness Beckons. The Brewing Storm. The River Runs Red. Penance. From West to East. Tackling the Problem.

7383 : Enter the sanctorium? Yes. No.
7384 : Arcane etchings are carved into the surface of the rock.
7385 : You should be able to teleport to the Crag of [Holla/Dem/Mea] from here.
7386 : Ready to teleport? Yes. No.
7387 : These whisperings on the wind...are they meant to mock me?
7388 : How do you respond? It's me! %! Who do you think it is?
7389 : M-Master!
7390 : Oh, Master! Not even Altana herself can comprehend the joy I feel at hearing your voice!
7391 : And to think you followed me to a land that must seem as the end of the world!
7392 : Wait...I recognize that voice.
7393 : M-Master!? Could that truly be you?
7394 : Master, do you remember when we returned to the mothercrystal?
7395 : The blessing of Phoenix was with me in full force.
7396 : And I closed my eyes, pleading her to give you breath once more.
7397 : But you began to flicker and fade, and my heart sank at the thought of never seeing you again.
7398 : But now, Master... You do my heart good.
7399 : Me? You wish to know what I was doing?
7400 : When the light came to my eyes, I was back here...on Reisenjima.
7401 : Although the time I hail from is only years into the future, not centuries, I can scarce believe how much it has changed. Thank the powers that be that I was able to reach this stone.
7402 : I lifted my voice in prayer, and the spirits saw fit to cure me of my ills.
7403 : I know not whether it was the protection of the Goddess, but I found myself with corporeal form yet again.
7404 : How do you respond? Weren't you attacked on the way? Are you sure you're well? I'll take things from here!
7405 : Master--then I was not the only one?
7406 : This island is a sacred one. To see it besieged by such vile forces makes my blood boil.
7407 : Forgive me for being brash, but I would ask for your aid in dealing with them.
7408 : I must confess that I am drained in both body and spirit.
7409 : That is why I must beseech your aid in visiting a particular location on this island.
7410 : Master, never let anyone doubt that you remain a stalwart hero.
7411 : If I may be so bold, please lend me your aid with a small task on this island.
7412 : I have not the freedom to move from the immediate vicinity.
7413 : It is all I can do to erect a magicked barrier to prevent the beasts crawling Reisenjima from approaching this location.
7414 : The narakas prowling the sacred forests would seize even the smallest chance to destroy this stone wall.
7415 : Master, I understand that your journey has left you weary, but your assistance would be a great boon.
7416 : Please, lend sword and spell to vanquish the narakas that threaten to overrun me.
7417 : I would lend my glaive if I could...but Master, let me ask this one boon of you.
7418 : You must defeat # narakas that appear each night.
7419 : Master! Wait!
7420 : And so countless cycles of the moon passed.
7421 : The Void's tendrils choked Vana'diel, a lone crystal shining as a beacon against the darkness.
7422 : How many worlds had succumbed? None could say.
7423 : And on Vana'diel, the only place left...was Reisenjima.
7424 : Vana'diel...she is vanishing before our very eyes.
7425 : Iroha, now is not the time to abandon hope!
7426 : [Lord/Lady] %, you mentioned having one last card to play.
7427 : Are you so far gone as to think it will actually work!?
7428 : Master!!!
7429 : Iroha, if we cannot place our faith in [Lord/Lady] %, then what other hope do we have!?
7430 : This was the Reckoning...the decision that I--or rather, your future self--came to.
7431 : You shed all the darkness within your soul to ascend...to become a god of light.
7432 : For that was the only way to banish the Void.
7433 : Did we make it?
7434 : We have.
7435 : Now is the time...
7436 : For Vana'diel to shine once more.
7437 : Togetherrr we must...and we can.
7438 : Let's give 'em a swift kick to the face!
7439 : This world is ours to protect.
7440 : For Vana'diel!
7441 : Don't even try it!
7442 : Hah!
7443 : Grrraaaaaaaaah!
7444 : Come, Curilla!
7445 : By my blade!
7446 : Iroha, steel yourself!
7447 : Just a little longer...
7448 : Zeid, watch your back!
7449 : Wha--!?
7450 : Ovjang! Mnejing! Go get 'em!
7451 : Begone!
7452 : Though I've never been one to bestow a largess, It's time to give it our all, and of our fears divest! Ohohohoho!
7453 : Then it's time for Meteor, dear Doctor?
7454 : Iroha, the barrier! Now!
7455 : Praise be! Victory is within our grasp!
7456 : Your body...%!?
7457 : %?
7458 : We've managed to...stave off the assault...
7459 : Iroha, I am so proud of you.
7460 : F-Father...
7461 : <Gulp>!
7462 : I have made...a grave error. This darkness is not what I had surmised.
7463 : My other half...this is not how Vana'diel is saved.
7464 : Father!
7465 : Iroha, don't!
7466 : Phoenix, please...
7467 : Save...my daughter!
7468 : % had become an entity of pure light, expelling every shadow that lay within [him/her].
7469 : [He/She] ascended to greatness, finding [himself/herself] in Ru'Hmet.
7470 : And it was there that at last Altana's voice reached [him/her].
7471 : My child, thy will hath preserved thee... But thou art human no longer.
7472 : Those who have fallen...
7473 : ...Despite your efforts...
7474 : ...All life...
7475 : ...Shall be extinguished.
7476 : Start from where? Beginning. Heroes approach. Prepare for barrier. Wave. Barrier activated. Darkness. Godhood.
7477 : [Lord/Lady] %!
7478 : I had written you off as vanishing with Selh'teus!
7479 : Do you know what that does to a man's heart!?
7480 : I'd always wanted ta visit here, and it's proven to be well worth the journey.
7481 : And Aldo here... Aldo? Gotten over what ails ye?
7482 : Grk... Not everyone...can be a salty sea dog...
7483 : Har har! Just be glad we didn't have ta call man overboard! when ye were retching o'er the side.
7484 : [Lord/Lady] %, what transpired while you were away?
7485 : So what we have been calling the ambassador is really an alternate aspect of you...from the future?
7486 : Can that e'en be possible? Just what kinda secrets are ye hidin' under those clothes o' yers?
7487 : %, people in the Far East come to call you Master, correct?
7488 : Then perhaps you used some technique you learned here.
7489 : Indeed. I do not presume to know everything about our martial or spiritual arts, so the possibility of there being something I have overlooked is great.
7490 : But let us turn to more pressing matters. Lord Selh'teus and Lady Iroha bid you cleanse these woods of a particular blight, did they not?
7491 : Iroha? Then where is she?
7492 : Where is Iroha? She rests with the crystal. She's passed on. She's within all of us.
7493 : She has reached the end of her rope and can revive no longer...
7494 : But ye were still able ta talk to her?
7495 : We can at least be grateful that her spirit lives on.
7496 : Sh-she won't be able ta come back ta us?
7497 : Yet if you were able to converse with Lady Iroha, then some part of her yet remains.
7498 : We can at least be grateful that her spirit lives on.
7499 : Urk...I've never had much of a mind for riddles.
7500 : Although our calling is to save the future, we cannot neglect our responsibilities to Iroha.
7501 : I concur.
7502 : We might be worried 'bout her, but right now th' best we can do is see her task to conclusion.
7503 : If helping th' crystal is what we've gotta do, then count us in.
7504 : And the key to bringing Iroha back lies in one and the same.
7505 : Yup. So whaddaya say--lend our friend a hand?
7506 : Then if eleven of them must go, eleven it shall be.
7507 : And afterwards, we meet up here.
7508 : Let's do it.
7509 : Reisenjima Sanctorium...
7510 : I made a pilgrimage here once, when I was a young boy who barely came up to his father's knees.
7511 : We came to purify my family's most sacred treasure--the Phoenix Blade.
7512 : The two of ye are quicker than a shark chasin' wounded prey.
7513 : And ye know somethin', Tenzen? For such a sacred island, it sure doesn't have many people on it.
7514 : And what's with all th' black orbs floatin' about?
7515 : I cannot say for sure. It isn't quite the Emptiness, but beyond that, there is no way of telling.
7516 : Regardless, this island lacks a stable population because we refer to it as the Island of the Gods. As such, it is meant to remain sacrosanct.
7517 : Though the devout are permitted to visit, only those who tend to the sanctorium take up permanent residence.
7518 : Wait up!
7519 : Aldo, if yer late because of yer seasickness again, so help me...
7520 : G-Gilgamesh...
7521 : P-putting that aside, we've managed to fulfill Iroha's request!
7522 : [Lord/Lady] %, am I to understand that Selh'teus's crystal waits inside?
7523 : Then Lady Iroha must be there as well.
7524 : So what are we waiting fer?
7525 : Ah, this gentle breeze is more comforting than I could have ever imagined.
7526 : At long last, I am able to gaze upon a Vana'diel whose future is bright and full of hope.
7527 : I witnessed all that transpired above while I was held in the crystal's embrace.
7528 : And though millions have reason to offer you their thanks, I hope that you will take mine to heart.
7529 : Your decision...the Reckoning...brought us back from the brink of ruin.
7530 : And both the present and future owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude.
7531 : You gained dominion over light and darkness, shouldered the burdens of the world, and nonetheless emerged victorious.
7532 : You wound the ancient clock, and in so doing assured that all would live on: people, beastmen, plants, animals...everything.
7533 : People are susceptible to the whims of light and darkness, and so help maintain the precious balance our world needs.
7534 : Master, I shall never forget the first lesson you taught me when I became your apprentice: Never give up.
7535 : This teaching has stayed with me through all the trials and tribulations I went through in the future...even at the very end, when I was left alone with no one to lean on.
7536 : And you showed me that your lessons were more than just words, for never once did you falter, even though the future I showed you was one filled with despair.
7537 : I know you will always be there for us.
7538 : The light I saw in your eyes then is the same as it is now.
7539 : Those selfsame eyes showed me the path I must walk, and I shall never forget how your training helped light the way.
7540 : Master...
7541 : Are you proud of how far I have come?
7542 : How do you respond? You've done better than I hoped. You still have a ways to go.
7543 : ...Perhaps you are right. An apprentice who stops learning is one who stops growing.
7544 : Once again, your words move me. I will sleep better knowing you have faith in me.
7545 : Our bonds have grown closer than ever before...
7546 : I fear I am not long for this time...
7547 : Though we must never forget the past, I would ask you to look toward the future. A brighter future.
7548 : What do you do? Stay. Leave.
7549 : Master, please walk ever forward...so that you may come to lead me on the correct path.
7550 : Master!!!
7551 : I feared you had fallen in battle!
7552 : How do you respond? Forget me. I'm glad you're safe. What happened? Where are the monsters? What about everyone up there?
7553 : Despite all you have been through, your first thoughts turn to my safety. I am deeply touched.
7554 : And Selh'teus, too, is unharmed.
7555 : He is focusing on helping you remain in this world, and as such cannot express his thanks directly.
7556 : Before he vanished, he told me, Leave the safety of the crystal to me.
7557 : And your friends are here, all waiting for you. Please, follow me.
7558 : The Cloud of Darkness was scattered into wisps...then vanished completely.
7559 : The forces of light and darkness entrusted to you unleashed an unimaginably forceful wind...and I do not have to tell you what that means.
7560 : Yet you were not strong enough to withstand it, and suffered grievous wounds in the struggle.
7561 : We gathered together to bring your spirit back to the world of the living.
7562 : Your friends are here, all waiting for you. Please, follow me.
7563 : Master, it is only a little ways farther. Take it one step at a time.
7564 : Even in your weakened state, your powers of perception are unmatched.
7565 : This is indeed Reisenjima, although not the one you know.
7566 : This is all the benevolent work of Sir Selh'teus.
7567 : Their spirits reach out to you in song...a rhapsody to bring you succor.
7568 : All those you have known during your time have called you back to us.
7569 : %, you've done it. You truly have.
7570 : Not that any of us doubted you! Heh heh heh.
7571 : Urhguum...no, our Vana'diel...owes you a debt of gratitude it can never repay.
7572 : And in saving Vana'diel, you've saved my world as well.
7573 : I would have expected no less of my partner!
7574 : Hehehe. As one of Future Fabulous, I could never be more proud!
7575 : And without you, the five of us would never have come together.
7576 : And not just you...Iroha as well.
7577 : Alas, she may be nearing the end of her journey. Go to her before it's too late.
7578 : And so my journey ends where it began.
7579 : ...No. Every end is just a new beginning.
7580 : Master, promise that you will continue working toward a brighter future even after I am gone.
7581 : The light you have gathered in your orb is not just that of those here today, but those whom you have touched throughout your adventures.
7582 : It is a symbol of all you have accomplished.
7583 : Those spirits will light the way when the world goes dark, and wrap you in warmth when the night grows cold.
7584 : Forever and always.
7585 : But the orb is nothing more than just a symbol. You needn't carry it with you any longer, for everyone will still be with you.
7586 : And there's one more thing.
7587 : We are all humbled by your service these past fourteen years.
7588 : My heart races at the thought of seeing you again in the future that we all know will come.
7589 : And it shall arrive faster than we think, as long as Selh'teus's crystal continues to shine.
7590 : And though I may have died and been reborn countless times, I look forward to my first birth many years from now.
7591 : How do you respond? Please--don't go! Is there nothing I can do? ...
7592 : Fear not. My disappearance only means that my perilous journey to the past is no longer needed.
7593 : Or more plainly, that Vana'diel's future is safe.
7594 : Master, this is not Farewell.
7595 : It is See you soon.
7596 : Until our paths cross once more...
7597 : ...The blessing of Phoenix is yours to wield.
7598 : And I'll be with you, always.
7599 : Skip credits.
7600 : Start from where? Start. Flowers. Bamboo. Slope. Gates. Heroines. Iroha. 14 years. Rhapsodies. Credits. Awakening.
7601 : Light begins to shimmer and twist as you pass your hand over it.
7602 : The blinding light obscures your vision of the world beyond.
7603 : Your pinches of escha silt trigger a faint reaction in the light, granting a small glimpse of what lies beyond.

8140 : ...
8141 : Who are you!?
8142 : It is an honor to meet you. My name is Gessho.
8143 : We have come to Reisenjima on urgent business at the Mikado's request.
8144 : This here is %, an adventurer whom I [place great faith in/share much in common with].
8145 : It has been a while.
8146 : Greetings, Gessho, %. I go by the name of Reikuu.
8147 : Archpriest Kokai of the Tengu sect has asked me to give you this letter, Gessho.
8148 : While I understand the need for secrecy, to think that the Tengu sect of the Far East wishes to work with the Middle Lands Theomilitary...
8149 : I suppose all things are possible, given enough time.
8150 : Wait, perhaps it has something to do with this World Eater Egg that has everyone so perturbed lately?
8151 : I am afraid so.
8152 : Or rather, the fledgling beast that is destined to hatch from the egg. I worry that we may already be too late.
8153 : It all goes back to the Incident at Sauromugue, which caused Sii Clarao the Flash, the founder of the Tengu sect, to first turn his gaze toward the East.
8154 : Many of our compatriots were overrun by the fledgling beast we referred to as Nesnas, in a battle that stained the land red with their blood.
8155 : If such a battle were to be waged within the lands of the Far East once again, I am afraid that defeat is a foregone conclusion. At least as long as this vacant darkness fails to abate...
8156 : And so it was that our leader, the archpriest Kokai, implored the Mikado that the denizens of the Far East come together as one in order to survive.
8157 : The Incident at Sauromugue... I have heard the tales of Sii Clarao's bravery.
8158 : So you mean to say that the monster known as Nesnas that was defeated during that battle was none other than the one hatched from the World Eater Egg!?
8159 : That is correct--for if you wish to know the origins of the Tengu sect, you must start with that battle.
8160 : Long ago, in the still-verdant fields of Sauromugue...
8161 : Many Yagudo gave their lives in order to stop the monster due to hatch from the World Eater Egg.
8162 : The fledgling beast known as Nesnas managed to continually revive itself, despite being put down numerous times on the day...
8163 : Eventually, when the beast was brought down for the last time, only twelve brave Yagudo warriors were left standing.
8164 : As such, they came to be revered by the Yagudo.
8165 : Eventually, one of the warriors took advantage of the devotion and referred to himself as their god. His goal was to gain autocratic rule over the Yagudo masses.
8166 : He went on to become the Yagudo's first living deity, Ree Habalo.
8167 : He argued that a truly strong nation is one based in faith, and set out to reinvent the entire belief system and history of the Yagudo race.
8168 : However, another of the twelve heroes and founder of the Far East, Sii Clarao the Flash, questioned the intent of Ree Habalo's actions.
8169 : Ree Habalo went so far as to suggest that the deaths of their many comrades at the Incident at Sauromugue had been due to this concept of faith, or perhaps a lack of it.
8170 : In response, Sii Clarao of the Far East declared that he also died in Sauromugue, and that he was resigned to his fate.
8171 : Thus, Sii Clarao set out on a journey of mourning with a group of like-minded supporters, sailing into the rough seas ahead before them.
8172 : Hmm... I have never heard this part of the tale before.
8173 : I learned that Sii Clarao was the first archpriest of the Tengu and that his views on death came about from the Incident at Sauromugue, but...
8174 : That was by design. One can only imagine the amount of blood that was spilled as a result of all that transpired.
8175 : Yet even more concerning was that at the time, the Yagudo were eager to retake the continent of Mindartia.
8176 : However, if Nesnas were to reemerge within the Far East now, nothing really matters anymore...
8177 : The Far East includes both lords and commoners alike, as well as a variety of different races. You are worried now, even with the region's various apparitions, spirits, and gods united as one?
8178 : That is why Master Kokai, leader of the Tengu sect, decided to form an alliance with the Middle Lands Theomilitary.
8179 : To be honest, the Theomilitary laughed at the idea of an alliance and stated that it would not even consider the possibility.
8180 : Naturally, it is safe to say things have gotten off to a rather inauspicious start.
8181 : However, just recently, the obstinate stance of the leader, Tzee Xicu the Manifest, has begun to soften.
8182 : That is likely due to receiving word of the trouble the Orcs had when they attempted to use the World Eater Egg for their own ends.
8183 : Or perhaps it is because of the rumors that the dead are appearing across the land. Some say that it is somehow related to the World Eater Egg...
8184 : Whatever the case, I believe I have a grasp on the current situation now. According to the archpriest's letter, there is a mission you wish to ask of me?
8185 : Yes, that is correct. Tzee Xicu the Manifest wishes to procure powerful weaponry so that the alliance with the Tengu sect is on equal footing.
8186 : At the top of that list is the black sword that the Goblin clad in black armor wears at its side.
8187 : Rumor has it that only a Goblin with the black sword can break open the World Eater Egg...
8188 : Tzee Xicu has stated that a Goblin is not fit to wield such a blade--it is a weapon meant for a god.
8189 : So in other words, you wish for me to seek them out and steal this black sword?
8190 : No, spies have been dispatched throughout the land in search of it, but after being seen in Aht Urhgan, it simply vanished without a trace.
8191 : Therefore, the archpriest has asked us to seek the cooperation of the Goblins living here in Reisenjima instead.
8192 : As fellow residents of the Far East, they share the same fears as we all. If we approach them in a kindly manner, they will surely agree to help us.
8193 : However, it is not as if just any Goblin knows of the sword's location or how to forge one...
8194 : So only a chosen few know the details? Like some kind of secret passed down within the Goblin clan?
8195 : Likely so. Therefore, we wish to see your famed powers of persuasion at work, Master Gessho. We are rapidly running out of options, as well as time.
8196 : Leave it to me. I am well known for my negotiating skills, having earned the praise of the Mikado himself.
8197 : In that case, Master Gessho, please pay a visit to the Goblins Emporox and Incantrix in order to find this black sword.
8198 : Ah, perfect! Someone I can count on!
8199 : %, I assume you heard all of that? I would like to ask for your kind assistance in this matter!
8200 : Will you help Gessho? Sure, no problem. I'm sorry...
8201 : Ah! Please, I beg you to reconsider!
8202 : In general, Goblins tend to prefer dealing with people. Furthermore, you are also an adventurer, making you the perfect choice for the job.
8203 : Now then, please speak with Incantrix for me. You should find him just past the sparkling light.
8204 : Time is of the essence, so I shall go and speak with Emporox myself.
8205 : %, the talk of an alliance between the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary is still a secret, so please keep it to yourself. Your discretion in the matter is appreciated.
8206 : Tzee Xicu the Manifest desires the black sword worn by a Goblin.
8207 : Please go past the sparkling light and speak with the Goblin known as Incantrix in order to find out how we may acquire the sword.
8208 : However, please remember that talk of an alliance between the Tengu sect and the order is still a secret. Your discretion in the matter is appreciated.
8209 : Hey youse--is dat % youse gots?
8210 : I's been lookin' fer that fer ages! Gimme! Gimme now!
8211 : How do you respond? How can I defeat the beast? Tell me about the World Eater Egg. Tell me about the black sword.
8212 : Beast? Whatcha talkin' 'bout?
8213 : Ah, I gets it now--dat creature growin' inside the egg! Once it hatch, there's a big war goin' down!
8214 : But no hero sword needed! Just take down monster with sheer force!
8215 : World Eater Egg? You sure ya wants ta be messin' with such a thing?
8216 : Long, long time ago, a terrible monster hate all things new. It lay eggs meant to destroy new world.
8217 : Smash egg before creature hatch, everythin' is good. But if creature hatch first, not so good. Lead to big war.
8218 : Black sword... Wait, you wants the hero's sword?
8219 : Do you want the hero's sword? Yes, definitely. Not really.
8220 : Youse definitely a fool. Hero's sword belong to hero. Youse no hero.
8221 : Youse good people. Hero's sword belong to hero. Youse no hero.
8222 : Them Tengu Yagudo [also /]want hero's sword. Yagudo no heroes though. They just don't get it.
8223 : Goblin hero decided five thousand years ago.
8224 : Hero's task is to smash egg. Decided five thousand years ago.
8225 : But Yagudo forgets all that. Even though Yagudo also around five thousand years ago.
8226 : Yagudo never change, always forgettin' stuff. Yet always quick to ask fer help.
8227 : That why when he wents to meet with Yagudo... I's lost someone very important ta me...
8228 : Fickblix, my adorable lil' brother. He killed by two-legged adventurers...
8229 : Adventurer, youse forgets this already?
8230 : Did you forget about Fickblix? Sorry about that. No, of course not.
8231 : I's hates you. But, I's can't ignore dat % youse gots...
8232 : I's wrong 'bout you! I know Fickie would be happy!
8233 : Youse gots %, so youse must be special.
8234 : So you understand, yes? Stop doin' Yagudo's biddin' and leave me alone.
8235 : Besides, there is more important matter than hero's sword...
8236 : In northern part of island, where hippogryph roam... Yagudo in red mask is hurt.
8237 : I's kinda concerned, but don't wanna get involved. Youse go 'n check it out instead.
8238 : Yagudo oughtta be worried more about what's up ahead than hero's sword. Go to the northern part of island, where hippogryph are.
8239 : Yagudo in red mask is hurt. I's don't wanna get involved, so youse go instead.
8240 : Urgh...
8241 : %! Did you also hear about the fallen Yagudo from the Goblin!?
8242 : What's this!?
8243 : Alas, this appears to be the work of a rare and deadly poison!
8244 : Given its progression, I have no choice but to prepare a special antidote...
8245 : %, given the urgency of the situation, I must ask for your help.
8246 : I need you to gather some %. They are known for their distinctive croaking. I think three ought to suffice.
8247 : In addition, I will require you to procure % for me as well. I appreciate your assistance.
8248 : Meanwhile, I must polish that mirror to a brilliant shine...
8249 : Gessho has asked you to find three % and %.
8250 : Ah, you have gathered all of the necessary ingredients. You have my sincere gratitude!
8251 : Now, for the mirror...
8252 : Don't be surprised. Here, this just needs to be applied like so...
8253 : Ungh... Wh-where am I?
8254 : Huh!? Did you save me?
8255 : No, it was not me. This smoothskin known as % gathered the ingredients necessary to make the antidote used to save your life.
8256 : S-smoothskin?
8257 : I see... Reisenjima is a land in the outer reaches of the Far East where even smoothskins and Yagudo work together.
8258 : [Sir/Madam] %, thank you for coming to my aid.
8259 : My name is Nii Aquu. I am a servant in the employ of Tzee Xicu the Manifest.
8260 : Actually, I should say was in the employ...
8261 : Hmm... This is most interesting news. Would you mind telling me more?
8262 : I am Gessho. I have been sent to Reisenjima on an important mission for the Mikado of the Far East.
8263 : And this here is % the adventurer. Although a smoothskin, you can trust [him/her].
8264 : I see, you are on a mission for the Mikado of the Far East... I thought it was a rather unusual pairing, kyah.
8265 : Ack-ack-ack... I must thank my good fortune for meeting one such as you here.
8266 : Squawk! Please, I ask that you allow me to join the ranks of the Tengu sect!
8267 : Wh-what did you say!?
8268 : I previously served as a Yagudo Abbot in the Middle Lands! I hereby vow to dutifully serve the Tengu sect!
8269 : So what you are saying is that you wish to abandon the Theomilitary and join the Tengu sect instead?
8270 : Quawk! That is correct!
8271 : Very well, but I must ask why.
8272 : Kyah-kyah. I am afraid there are some rather unfortunate circumstances which prevent me from speaking of the matter...
8273 : I understand, but there is someone you will need to tell eventually.
8274 : And who would that be, kyah?
8275 : There is someone here currently in Reisenjima that is even more knowledgeable about the Tengu sect than I am.
8276 : His name is Commander Reikuu, and I shall take you to see him.
8277 : Quawk! Yes, Master Gessho! I would appreciate it greatly!
8278 : %, please deliver your report to Commander Reikuu when you have the chance.
8279 : I, too, wish to hear about your meeting with the Goblin.
8280 : Return to see Reikuu and report the details of your conversation with Incantrix.
8281 : What is this!? A priest who has fled here from the Middle Lands, you say!?
8282 : Yes, my lord. He has a story which you most definitely want to hear.
8283 : He was due to be dragged through Castle Oztroja and sentenced to death...
8284 : Kyah-kyah... Indeed, I failed my mission to obtain the World Eater Egg which had appeared somewhere within the Middle Lands.
8285 : It was all because the information I received from a certain man was completely fabricated. Ack-ack-ack!
8286 : However, I was not taken in by that smoothskin, kyah!
8287 : Because that man also truly believed that the World Eater Egg was there!
8288 : Yet, everyone decided that I was completely fooled by the smoothskin and had somehow injured the pride of the Yagudo!
8289 : Wait, so that was the World Eater Egg that was found atop the Beaucedine Glacier in the Middle Lands?
8290 : That is correct, kyah. The Orcs got to it first and that's how the egg was broken.
8291 : Tzee Xicu sought to obtain the egg and utilize the power contained within it.
8292 : Yes, that definitely sounds like something the Manifest would do.
8293 : However, now that the danger posed by the monster within the egg is clear, it seems that the Manifest has taken a different tack.
8294 : So at last the Manifest knows the true nature of the World Eater Egg...
8295 : Quawk-quawk!? Wait, does this mean that if I return to the order, my sins will be forgiven!?
8296 : Who can know for sure? According to what you said, it sounds like your biggest sin in the Manifest's eyes was injuring the pride of the Yagudo.
8297 : Yes, the mortal sin of shame...
8298 : Moreover, I would imagine it is quite difficult to overturn such a transgression after a ruling has been made. That is why you fled here in the first place, is it not?
8299 : Kyah-kyah... I had no other choice but to flee--everybody refused to take my side in the matter...
8300 : The Middle Lands Theomilitary is known for the harsh way it deals with those it views as heretics or outcasts.
8301 : Their doctrine states that the wise are strong and deserve to live, while the foolish are weak and should be eradicated.
8302 : I see... I suppose in that regard at least, the Tengu sect is the same way.
8303 : Nii Aquu, you should have sought a way to restore your honor before you decided to abandon your homeland.
8304 : Above all, you should have slain the smoothskin who deceived you.
8305 : Yes, in regards to that... The smoothskin is extremely powerful. He easily brushed aside me and all of my fellow warriors...
8306 : What!? Who is this smoothskin you speak of?
8307 : Kyah... Well, I know for certain he was a Tarutaru black mage.
8308 : However, I cannot seem to recall his name, kyah. Perhaps I am under some kind of spell...
8309 : So he may have cast an enchantment on you...
8310 : There is not much that can be done about that. However, as far as I can tell, this all came about due to your own weakness. The Tengu sect will not ignore that fact either.
8311 : Uuugh...
8312 : Nii Aquu, I shall be honest with you.
8313 : The Tengu sect also has no place for the weak of mind and body!
8314 : Quawk!!!
8315 : We are currently busy preparing for the upcoming battle with the terrifying beast due to emerge from the World Eater Egg.
8316 : The reason being, if this battle were to be waged within the lands of the Far East right now, it would match the Incident at Sauromugue in its destructiveness. We cannot allow such an event to pass.
8317 : The Incident at Sauromugue...
8318 : You hail from the Middle Lands and do not know of this incident? Well, I suppose the weak have no need for such knowledge.
8319 : Indeed, I am weak, kyah...
8320 : Kyah-kyah! However, I am willing to do anything! Anything you ask of me!
8321 : Then return to the Middle Lands. Go and accept your punishment with honor.
8322 : Quawk! Please, I beg of you!
8323 : Commander Reikuu...
8324 : Gessho, I know you understand just as well as I do.
8325 : What would happen if the Tengu sect harbored a fugitive from the Theomilitary?
8326 : If we were to do so, it would seriously jeopardize the talks regarding our potential alliance with them.
8327 : Precisely. This is an extremely important time for both parties, who have been at odds for hundreds of years now.
8328 : Only a fool would risk such an important achievement for the sake of a single, weak-willed individual.
8329 : I know that the Manifest would feel the same way, given what is at stake here.
8330 : I wonder if the Mikado would agree as well...
8331 : Gessho, you are not to feel any sympathy for this weak and feeble-minded fool, do you understand?
8332 : Of course.
8333 : Ah, %, I am sorry you had to see that.
8334 : We have no choice but to leave that young Yagudo to his fate. So far, I am unable to find any reason to save him.
8335 : However, I am grateful for the kindness you showed in helping to save his life from that poison.
8336 : You appear to have received information from the Goblin, at least to a certain extent. You should report your findings to Lord Reikuu as soon as possible.
8337 : I am ashamed to say that I failed in my own negotiations and am heading back to try again. Now, if you will please excuse me...
8338 : %, I must apologize for what transpired back there.
8339 : That expression on your face... Do you feel sympathy for the coward Nii Aquu?
8340 : Do you feel sympathy for him? Yes, somewhat. No, not really.
8341 : I heard as much from Gessho. He tells me that you are a mighty warrior, but at the same time, possess a gentle spirit.
8342 : You have known Gessho for a long time. Therefore, I believe you understand us Yagudo well, and know that there are some things we cannot abide.
8343 : [However,/You see,] the situation is not so simple. Surely you know of the cultural differences between the Middle Lands and the Far East?
8344 : Although our outward appearances are quite similar, the beliefs, customs, and everything else about us could not be more different.
8345 : It is an extremely difficult endeavor to join the Tengu sect and live in the Far East. Those that do must empty their mind of all they have learned before.
8346 : In fact, there is a group of young people sent from the Theomilitary that are still having a hard time of it.
8347 : In that respect, Gessho truly is quite extraordinary.
8348 : Possessing the flexibility to respond to and even thrive in a completely new environment... That is his true strength and a large reason why the Mikado thinks so highly of him.
8349 : Still, Gessho appears to be having trouble dealing with the Goblin...
8350 : How about you? What did you learn from Incantrix?
8351 : Well done, %!
8352 : You have brought me two pieces of most valuable information. I owe you my sincere gratitude.
8353 : The first is Incantrix's feelings regarding the matter.
8354 : Based on our investigations, I thought his actions were somewhat strange for a Goblin, even though he said they were [for a/to bring back his] friend.
8355 : However, you say it was for his younger brother, and not a friend at all? That must have been like salt on his wounds.
8356 : Secondly, this talk of the black sword is rather alarming.
8357 : The black sword is the hero's sword, and he said that the hero is also a Goblin?
8358 : It sounds rather far-fetched, but as for something that happened five thousand years ago that the Yagudo forgot about...
8359 : Naturally, the Tengu sect does not know about such ancient events. Of course, I would have to speak with the archpriest to be certain...
8360 : Normally, the Middle Lands Theomilitary would be knowledgeable regarding such history.
8361 : However, following the Incident at Sauromugue, the first living deity erased any history that would be troubling for his role as a god.
8362 : If it was said that the Yagudo were not worthy to be the legendary hero as far back as five thousand years ago, it may call into question the divinity of the current deity as well.
8363 : It only stands to reason, given that there is nothing that a god should not be capable of.
8364 : Hmm... It really does make you wonder...
8365 : I imagine you bringing word of this black sword to the Theomilitary would only serve to incur the Manifest's wrath.
8366 : Well, I suppose we have no choice but to ask Incantrix more about this incident that occurred five thousand years ago.
8367 : I am counting on you, %. Please continue to look into this matter for me.
8368 : I must hurry and approve the letter to be sent to the Theomilitary. It is imperative that I act before they send someone after their fugitive...
8369 : Can you please ask Incantrix for more details regarding the incident that occurred five thousand years ago, as well as this hero he mentioned?
8370 : Meanwhile, I must deal with the letter to be sent to the Theomilitary. It needs to be handled before they arrive here in search of their fugitive...
8371 : Hey youse, I's told ya to leave me alone!
8372 : Wh-what's worse...
8373 : Y-ya broughts a Yagudo witchu!
8374 : Hmph. The mere sight of you offends me, Goblin.
8375 : I know how you Goblins have infested this island in an attempt to try and hide yourselves, all the while with bated breath.
8376 : ...
8377 : Hm? I believe we have met before?
8378 : I am Zhuu Buxu the Silent. Yes, I encountered you in Giddeus, if I'm not mistaken.
8379 : What am I doing here on such a remote island, you ask? I am tracking a priest wearing a red mask.
8380 : Now I ask you, what are are you doing here? Wait, don't tell me you're still searching for the World Eater Egg?
8381 : Kyah-kyah-kyah!
8382 : You're working for both the Tengu sect and us Middle Lands Yagudo too? You must be tired, kyah!
8383 : While you're at it, I have another task for you.
8384 : Have you seen the Yagudo priest I was talking about? He goes by the name of Nii Aquu.
8385 : Uh, why youse lookin' fer him, hm?
8386 : To take him back to the Middle Lands, of course.
8387 : He must be brought before Tzee Xicu the Manifest and then paraded through the castle and swiftly executed for his crimes.
8388 : Executed... Y-youse means to kill him?
8389 : Yes, pretty much. The buffoon was deceived by a smoothskin, and then beaten soundly when he sought his vengeance.
8390 : If he was deceived, he's must not be entirely bad...
8391 : No, I suppose not in the eyes of you Goblins! You know nothing of honor! However, to us Yagudo, he is guilty of great crimes against our people!
8392 : Besides, what's it to you, anyway? Have you seen him? You have, haven't you!
8393 : Have you seen him? Yes, I have. Sorry, can't help you.
8394 : Where is he? Where did you last see him?
8395 : U-uh, I's saws a hurt Yagudo... He was up north.
8396 : But he's not there anymore.
8397 : Are you sure? There's no point in lying to me.
8398 : I's no sees him either... I don't get involved with no Yagudo.
8399 : Quawk! I'm quickly growing weary of you, Goblin!
8400 : Well, no matter. This island isn't very big, so I'll find him eventually. Although, the sooner, the better...
8401 : It's so boring when I find nothing but their bones remaining, picked clean by the local wildlife. The executioner isn't very happy with me in such cases either.
8402 : After all, the death penalty is necessary to protect the sacred tenets of the Theomilitary. Kyah-kyah-kyah!
8403 : ...
8404 : Okay, I'm leaving now, but if you see Nii Aquu, I want you to inform me or the Yagudo at the gate immediately. Understood?
8405 : Naturally, I will be happy to compensate you for the trouble. You, Goblin... How would you like some magicite?
8406 : !?
8407 : With it, you could even bring someone back from the dead... Yes, I think it would suit your purposes rather nicely.
8408 : How do youse know 'bout that?
8409 : Besides, even I's knows it's not an easy item ta find...
8410 : Kyah-kyah-kyah! Believe me, or don't believe me. I don't really care either way!
8411 : Curse that Yagudo! He's gots me all mad now!
8412 : Still, it's nothin' ta do with me... I's knows not this Nii Aquu he's talkin' 'bout.
8413 : Still, the death penalty is bad... Real bad. He's right ta run.
8414 : Because even a single life is precious... So fragile...
8415 : Youse gots %. Yer special, yes?
8416 : So youse understand, right? Why I's angry? Why I's worry 'bout that Nii Aquu?
8417 : Let's find strong Yagudo, not Zhuu Buxu.
8418 : Tell him what happened. Nii Aquu's gonna get caught 'n executed--pursuer is here...
8419 : Ah! I know! A strong Yagudo visit Emporox! He's at the waterfall in northwest Reisenjima!
8420 : He's not like Yagudo--he kind. How's 'bout him? Go 'n talk to him!
8421 : Tell Yagudo at waterfall in northwest Reisenjima.
8422 : Say Zhuu Buxu come to capture Nii Aquu and execute him.
8423 : I's worried, but don't wanna get involved. Youse go fer both of us.
8424 : What? The fugitive's pursuer is here already!? And it is none other than Zhuu Buxu himself!?
8425 : Interestingly enough, I just received a letter from the Theomilitary. Perhaps it arrived on the ship with him...
8426 : Furthermore, he has yet to formally greet following his arrival. How rude!
8427 : Oh, is that you, %?
8428 : I heard the news from Lord Reikuu. You got Incantrix to talk? Most impressive.
8429 : I suppose that lessens the sting of my failure somewhat.
8430 : In times like these, I find it useful to come meditate under the purifying waters of a waterfall.
8431 : At any rate, if only there were something to help in our negotiations with the Goblins...
8432 : What's that? Incantrix has something he wishes to ask of us?
8433 : It only stands to reason--Nii Aquu was found guilty, so the Theomilitary was sure to send someone after him eventually.
8434 : However, to think that it was my old acquaintance Zhuu Buxu that they sent... This complicates matters considerably.
8435 : Don't look so surprised. Truth be told, I owe a great debt to Zhuu Buxu.
8436 : I once received direct orders from the Mikado to deliver a letter to Castle Oztroja in the Middle Lands, requesting their assistance.
8437 : And in exchange for my efforts, I was granted an audience with Tzee Xicu the Manifest, presenting an ornate blade as a gift and endlessly prostrating myself, but our request was rejected flat out.
8438 : Having disgraced the Mikado by failing the task entrusted to me, I was prepared for the very worst.
8439 : However, Zhuu Buxu, who was there attending to another matter, came to my rescue.
8440 : He said that by taking me in, it was a good way for the Theomilitary to rid itself of some dead weight.
8441 : He compared individuals without talent such as myself to a rotting orange, which tends to quickly spoil the other oranges around it. He suggested the Theomilitary would be better served by sending me away to the Far East.
8442 : Thanks to his impassioned talk about killing two birds with one stone, Zhuu Buxu had me placed in a position of authority, with actual soldiers serving beneath me.
8443 : And so not only did I manage to avoid embarrassing the Mikado, but I was also able to return home in one piece.
8444 : Naturally, I heard how difficult it is to retrain relocated soldiers both physically and mentally, but it was better than the alternative.
8445 : And that is how Zhuu Buxu and I came to know each other.
8446 : I still have yet to repay that debt I owe him. As such, I would normally do whatever I could to find Nii Aquu.
8447 : However...
8448 : I don't imagine you wish to be involved with a Yagudo criminal, do you, %?
8449 : Do you want to be involved? No, I don't. Actually, I don't mind. Isn't that a bit harsh?
8450 : I understand. However, we have no choice if we want Incantrix to tell us about the incident that occurred five thousand years ago and the black sword.
8451 : You needn't worry about it though.
8452 : I have always known you were a kind soul, %.
8453 : As such, that is probably why Incantrix agreed to talk with you.
8454 : You smoothskins and we Yagudo are brought up differently, so I suppose there are some things you just can't possibly understand.
8455 : I was born and raised in the Far East, but up until recently, children were often discarded in order to reduce the number of mouths to feed.
8456 : Unlike you smoothskins, Yagudo have many children, sometimes too many. As such, if there is a way to somehow measure the value of a life, I suppose that of a Yagudo is worth less than others.
8457 : However, I do not need your sympathy.
8458 : [You see,/However,/You see,] those of us from the Far East are taught that living the way of the warrior means finding a way to die.
8459 : In order to avoid bringing shame upon those around me, I spend every waking moment with the intention of dying the very moment it becomes necessary.
8460 : In that way, I can follow the right path which allows me to avoid shameful actions. That is how we are taught.
8461 : We are somewhat like ninja, and although I cannot claim to be a samurai, I do feel a strong connection to their teachings.
8462 : And according to those teachings, Nii Aquu is a coward who should be ashamed of himself.
8463 : The proper course of action would have been to fight that Tarutaru black mage whose name he cannot remember to the death. That would have been a fitting demise worthy of his station and considered atonement for his misdeeds.
8464 : However, to continue to live in shame, and eventually meet with an ignoble death inside the walls of Oztroja Castle...
8465 : First of all, Nii Aquu needs to realize that he has strayed from the proper path.
8466 : And once he does that, perhaps he can search for a new one, or...
8467 : Hmm... Although I may be incapable of guiding Nii Aquu, perhaps Incantrix can.
8468 : We should tell him to inform Nii Aquu about the incident from five thousand years ago, and that the war is in danger of happening again.
8469 : It is sure to be a fierce battle, so if he insists upon living, then perhaps there is still hope for him to find his path once more.
8470 : You need to pay another visit to Incantrix.
8471 : Ah, I's glad ta see ya! Well, do ya have somethin' ta tell me!?
8472 : The Yagudo wants ta learn what they forgot, and he'll help Nii Aquu!?
8473 : Okay, but I's makes a big mistake!
8474 : I found Nii Aquu, stumblin' around, and told him scary Yagudo, Zhuu Buxu, is here lookin' fer him.
8475 : And then...
8476 : Ack-ack-ack... Zhuu Buxu the Silent is a fearsome assassin. He'll surely be the one to execute me once we're back in the Middle Lands.
8477 : No, but I mustn't give up yet, kyah. If only I can get the Tengu sect to agree to take me in...
8478 : Of course, my problems are all a result of my own weakness.
8479 : Stay strong. Youse still have hope. You still alive--that's most important thing.
8480 : Kyah... I may be alive, but I have no purpose. In fact, my life has always been meaningless...
8481 : Y-youse mustn't be sayin' such things!
8482 : Youse don't understand why I'm helpin' ya!
8483 : Fickie, my beloved li'l brother... He was killed in Castle Oztroja.
8484 : He went there, hopin' to make peace between people and beastmen...
8485 : But...he was killed. Life is precious, ya can't get it back once it's gone...
8486 : Quawk-quawk! Now I remember! I've heard that story before!
8487 : !?
8488 : I's thought da Yagudo had bad memory! I see youse got promise after all!
8489 : So, I's got one thing to say! Live! Survive! Run for yer life!
8490 : Kyah... I can't run. I don't want to be ashamed of life or death anymore.
8491 : !?
8492 : As such, there are only two choices left before me.
8493 : Kyah-kyah. I must either get the Tengu sect to take me in, or I need to chase off Zhuu Buxu.
8494 : However, both choices require me to be strong...
8495 : Well, if ya don't do somethin' soon, ya'll be killed and have no choices left!
8496 : You're right about that, kyah. Your little brother was too weak, and that's what got him killed.
8497 : !?
8498 : I's heard dat and gots hoppin' mad! I felt da blood rushin' to my head in pure rage!
8499 : So I tells him if he wants ta get stronger, he oughtta try Omen!
8500 : I's mentions that eastern part of island has different goodies not found 'round here.
8501 : Not too long ago, ninja person tell me all 'bout it.
8502 : Says priest people on this island use that Omen to get stronger.
8503 : Plenty o' goodies to be found, the place burstin' with Phoenix power. An excellent place fer trainin', they say.
8504 : Youse compete on number of soul fragments defeated. But, there's various rules too...
8505 : I's collectin' extra Phoenix power, so I's don't be usin' it there.
8506 : Plus, that place super scary. Ordinary person die quickly, strong person maybe live a li'l bit longer.
8507 : Still, Nii Aquu go to Omen fer trainin' anyway!
8508 : He sure to die there! I's finally calmed down now though!
8509 : But everythin' okay. I remember he has no gobbiebag, so he no transport to Omen.
8510 : I's finally cool off so I's been thinkin'.
8511 : My li'l brother Fickie, he hoped people 'n Goblins, people 'n Yagudo, people 'n beastmen could be friends.
8512 : But, I's can't be friends with Yagudo fer obvious reasons.
8513 : Fickie, didja want Goblins 'n Yagudo to be friends too?
8514 : I'll do my best. I's do what I can, anyway.
8515 : I need yer help. I's wanna apologize to Nii Aquu.
8516 : You've gots %, so please help me with this. I's meets ya near the other goodies in the eastern part o' the island.
8517 : I wants Goblins 'n Yagudo to be friends, for Fickie. So I wanna apologize to Nii Aquu.
8518 : You've gots %, so please help me with this. I's meets ya near the other goodies in the eastern part o' the island.
8519 : Kyah-kyah! Are you here on behalf of Zhuu Buxu!?
8520 : No, it's my doin' as this is no ordinary person. [He/She] is necessary fer us ta safely traverse Omen.
8521 : I somehow managed to make it this far, but I wasn't sure how to proceed beyond this light.
8522 : Thank you for your assistance, Incantrix.
8523 : Quawk! I vow to become stronger through this deadly training ground!
8524 : If Commander Reikuu allows me to join the Tengu sect, I won't have to fight any more pointless battles!
8525 : That is why I must be able to prove my worth in the battle against this fledgling beast that Commander Reikuu spoke of.
8526 : Fledgling beast?
8527 : You Yagudo is stoopid! Youse shouldn't mess with such dangerous things!
8528 : Smash World Eater Egg before creature hatch, everythin' is good. But if creature hatch first, not so good. Lead to big war.
8529 : Commander Reikuu is worried that war will reach the land of the Far East eventually.
8530 : I's know that. That's why he need powerful weapon. But Yagudo forgettin' somethin' very important!
8531 : Kyah? Forgetting something? Like what?
8532 : Five thousand years ago, there was a monster who hated anythin' new.
8533 : 'Twas known by the name Chaos and never stopped tryin' ta destroy anythin' that was new, even the new world itself.
8534 : Goblins, Yagudo, Orcs, Quadav... It considered anything dif'rent from itself ta be somethin' new.
8535 : It caused many creatures to go extinct before da strongest remainin' beings gathered together 'n joined forces.
8536 : In the southwestern area of the Middle Lands, the battle raged fer countless days 'n nights, with countless lives lost...
8537 : Eventually, Chaos was defeated. In fact, the brave hero that dealt da finishin' blow 'twas a Goblin!
8538 : Quawk!? D-did all that really happen!? I've never heard such a story before!
8539 : I's understand. All of Yagudo forget. Much time has passed o'er five thousand years.
8540 : Five thousand years ago? Yes, the history we're taught only goes back about 400 years, to the first deity, Ree Habalo.
8541 : Does this mean that not even Tzee Xicu the Manifest knows about this?
8542 : If knew, would hate egg. Would never want it for self.
8543 : The beast hatched from egg has same purpose as Chaos. Devour the new world, and anythin' new included within it.
8544 : That's why Goblins've been searchin' fer eggs left behind by Chaos for thousands o' years.
8545 : The black sword can smash egg, so the hero and his heirs've been on constant journey.
8546 : But, egg buried in Sauromugue hatched before it could be smashed.
8547 : Kyah... That must be the battle that Commander Reikuu referred to as the Incident at Sauromugue.
8548 : Most likely. Many die in that battle, so maybe many wanna forget.
8549 : ...
8550 : But, I hear egg hatched five thousand years ago is last one. Hmm...
8551 : Recently, another World Eater Egg found...
8552 : Kyah? Even though the Goblin hero searched for five thousand years, he never found them all?
8553 : And for one to be discovered now, all of a sudden, may mean that it is also close to hatching.
8554 : We might not know if that day is near, but just the possibility alone means I can no longer afford to be a weak and powerless Yagudo...
8555 : Quawk-quawk! I've definitely got to get stronger!
8556 : Even if not right away, I must prepare for when this monster returns, and be ready to sacrifice myself if need be!
8557 : Oy, don'tcha get it!? I want ya to live, stoopid!
8558 : Kyah... I don't know if you can understand this, but...
8559 : As a Yagudo, that is the path that will ensure my survival.
8560 : Hmm... I's not sure if I understand it or not...
8561 : Incantrix, I wish to take on this Omen challenge that lies ahead.
8562 : If youse made up yer mind, then fine. But it's too dangerous fer ya to go it alone.
8563 : You're powerful, so yer gonna join him on this trainin' mission.
8564 : Kyah-kyah! I appreciate the assistance, but are you sure about this?
8565 : Join him on the training mission? Let's do it. I'm not ready yet.
8566 : People used Omen fer their trainin', so people know da way to do it best.
8567 : Kyah... In that case, please help me! I'm begging you here!
8568 : People used Omen fer their trainin'. A ninja man told me the followin'...
8569 : It's a trainin' ground fer a master 'n disciple. Both can work to achieve the objective, while Phoenix power rains down from sky.
8570 : The goodies allow the disciple to grow stronger much faster, but with strength comes pain.
8571 : Kyah! I don't care! I will not waver in my mission!
8572 : If smoothskins are able to do this training, then there's no reason a Yagudo can't do it as well.
8573 : Youse lemme work a bit of Gobbie magic on that %...
8574 : I's done. This is %. ...And in return, I casts a li'l spells on ya.
8575 : And then bang! Crash! You'll see a wonderful omen of a world like ours, but a bit in the future.
8576 : This Omen trainin' location is different from the regular one. The % lets the entrance stay open.
8577 : Kyah-kyah! Ah, that's wonderful!
8578 : The eastern side of this island is entrance for other Omen training location.
8579 : Ya wanna use the % on that? If so, ya can train with Nii Aquu.
8580 : I am too weak, kyah... I detest myself.
8581 : However, that only means I have room to grow stronger, quawk.
8582 : Kyah-kyah! Please, let's do it again!
8583 : Kyah... I am weak...too weak. Is that why you're holding back?
8584 : There is no point in training if you let me win, quawk!
8585 : Kyah-kyah! Let's try it again, please!
8586 : Kyah...
8587 : Is youse okay!?
8588 : Kyah-kyah... I d-did it...
8589 : Simply amazin'! Now gets ya some rest!
8590 : Oh, no time fer that? Zhuu Buxu is still searchin' the island for ya.
8591 : Hm!? Who's there!?
8592 : Greetings. It's me, Gessho.
8593 : Huh!? What's wrong with you!?
8594 : Oh, I never knew such a place existed here on Reisenjima.
8595 : You've grown much stronger in such a short period of time. It is quite the impressive feat indeed.
8596 : Kyah... Master Gessho, do you think I'm strong enough to be accepted into the Tengu sect yet?
8597 : What do you think?
8598 : I feel that I've gotten stronger, but...
8599 : I believe the reason I performed better than expected was because I was competing against %.
8600 : I remembered the embarrassment, regret, and anger that I felt upon being beaten by that mage...
8601 : However, that alone won't be enough to fight against the monster that will hatch from the egg.
8602 : That is how I feel.
8603 : I see. It would seem you've heard from Incantrix about the story that the Yagudo had long forgotten.
8604 : I's had no choice. I's explained how five thousand years ago, everyone fought together as one.
8605 : Goblin, Meeble, citrullus, Yagudo, Orc, Quadav... Many different sides joinin' forces fer a common goal.
8606 : What are you talking about?
8607 : If youse wishs ta hear the story, listen up. Nii Aquu will tells ya all 'bout it.
8608 : Be sure ta tell all of Tengu Yagudo as well.
8609 : Hmm... I imagine Commander Reikuu might change his mind if he heard such a tale.
8610 : Nii Aquu, please accompany me to visit Commander Reikuu.
8611 : Yes, right away! Let's go, Master Gessho!
8612 : Is youse sure about this?
8613 : Kyah-kyah! Incantrix, thank you for all your help!
8614 : I shall never forget your concern for me and how you helped me find a place to train and grow stronger.
8615 : Also, I want to apologize for what I said about your brother.
8616 : Th-there's no need for that!
8617 : And you, %... Or perhaps I should call you my training instructor instead.
8618 : Master! Thank you for everything, quawk!
8619 : That reminds me... This is for you!
8620 : Kyah... I picked it up while in Omen, although I have no idea what it is.
8621 : I imagine it belonged to the people who trained there before. Hopefully, you can find a use for it.
8622 : %, you have the gratitude of the Yagudo for all that you've done for us.
8623 : Are youse gonna be okay, Nii Aquu? Will ya avoid the punishment that awaits ya?
8624 : But, somethin' else is worryin' me too...
8625 : I's thinkin' there's too many World Eater Eggs. Maybe I'll try contactin' the Goblin hero.
8626 : Chaos died five thousand years ago... So what's happenin' now?
8627 : You lost the %!
8628 : The % has been left behind!
8629 : Zhuu Buxu... What a farce.
8630 : I am disappointed in you, %.
8631 : No, I suppose I only have myself to blame. Perhaps I placed too much trust in your abilities.
8632 : Even still, I never thought you would take in the coward Nii Aquu and agree to serve as his mentor.
8633 : I witnessed his renewed fighting spirit firsthand when Gessho brought him before me. I will admit that I was impressed with how much he had grown.
8634 : However, I also realized that I should have made myself clearer to you.
8635 : No matter how strong he becomes, he will never be allowed to join us.
8636 : The Tengu sect is at a critical moment in its existence, so it is imperative that we form the alliance with the Theomilitary in the Middle Lands!
8637 : As such, how can we risk harboring a known fugitive from their side when even the slightest misstep could cause them to call the whole thing off?
8638 : Not only would it be a bad look for us, the fact that we did not even discuss it with them first could renew hostilities between the two sides.
8639 : That would go against everything we are currently trying to accomplish. Furthermore, it goes against the will of Lord Kokai, the leader of the Tengu sect.
8640 : That is why we must send Nii Aquu back to the Middle Lands, and if we are lucky, they will feel some sense of obligation toward us!
8641 : Which brings me to the subject of Gessho...
8642 : Even at this critical juncture, he shamelessly states that we should search for a proper path forward regarding the situation in order to honor the will of the Mikado and the archpriest.
8643 : Naturally, we should do what is right, but I keep telling him that we cannot welcome such a traitor into our midst. I feel as if we are simply going in circles here.
8644 : Of course, this is all a result of your actions, %.
8645 : As such, I would like to demand that you take responsibility for your role in this quagmire and pay the ultimate price...
8646 : However, I cannot overlook the fact that you managed to secure the assistance of the Goblin known as Incantrix.
8647 : The tale of Chaos, the black sword, and the Goblin hero that took place five thousand years ago... It was a difficult topic for us of the Tengu sect to hear.
8648 : Therefore, I have decided to merely banish you instead! You are to leave Reisenjima immediately and never return!
8649 : How do you respond? That's so cruel! Forgive me! Popopi!
8650 : Kyah-kyah! What's this? Did I hear you say that you've finally found Nii Aquu?
8651 : Ah, Master Zhuu Buxu the Silent. I have been eagerly awaiting your arrival.
8652 : At first, I thought the Tengu sect was secretly harboring the traitor, but it appears I was mistaken.
8653 : Those filthy Goblins are up to something, aren't they!
8654 : Someone believed to be Nii Aquu was seen sucked into a glowing vortex in eastern Reisenjima.
8655 : That sounds rather mysterious...
8656 : Yes, indeed. I doubt anyone would have expected him to hide in such an unusual location.
8657 : However, it appears he has now returned and is somewhere near the waterfall. Perhaps he goes there to meditate like Gessho does.
8658 : ...
8659 : No matter. I shall go there and see that he faces justice. Quawk-quawk!
8660 : If Master Zhuu Buxu can take the traitor back to the Middle Lands with him, then all of our problems will be solved...
8661 : Now, the only thing left is how to deal with Gessho. Unfortunately, that is one matter that will not resolve itself.
8662 : Master Zhuu Buxu left for the waterfall in the northwest. Now, if he can just find that traitor and take him back to the Middle Lands...
8663 : What are you still doing here!? I ordered you to leave the Far East and never return!
8664 : Kyah... Master, it seems that the path toward joining the Tengu sect is no longer available to me.
8665 : It pains me to say it, but I was foolish to think my plan could ever succeed, quawk...
8666 : Little did I know, everyone has already been preparing for the day we must face this terrifying monster.
8667 : The sect is searching for a black sword that has the power to smash the World Eater Egg.
8668 : However, it seems they can't find this sword, and the alliance between the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary is in danger of falling apart, kyah...
8669 : Furthermore, allowing me to join the Tengu sect under the current circumstances would only make the alliance even more unlikely.
8670 : Despite that, Master Gessho continues to go to the waterfall to meditate, determined to find a way to help me forward.
8671 : Kyah-kyah... However, there is little time remaining.
8672 : So are you saying that you will go quietly with Zhuu Buxu back to the Middle Lands and face execution?
8673 : Kyah... No.
8674 : Quawk!? You dare to deny your fate!?
8675 : Master Zhuu Buxu... It is good to see you again, old comrade.
8676 : Quawk! Gessho, what are you doing here!?
8677 : I have been working to secure the alliance between the Theomilitary and the Tengu sect.
8678 : Well, it is still early to be talking about any possible alliance. Nii Aquu, come and surrender quietly!
8679 : Kyah-kyah! No, I refuse to go with you!
8680 : You what!?
8681 : Quawk... There is only one path left before me now...
8682 : I must defeat you in battle!
8683 : Hahahaha! Have you gone mad? A priest is no match for an assassin!
8684 : Quawk! I have been training with my master here!
8685 : Kyah!? A Yagudo, calling a smoothskin master!?
8686 : In that case, I shall teach you and your master a lesson you'll never forget!
8687 : Come and face your destiny!
8688 : Ungh...
8689 : I-impossible... How could I have lost...
8690 : Master Zhuu Buxu, it appears you underestimated your opponent...
8691 : This is no good! No good at all!
8692 : Huh!?
8693 : Didja get in a fight!? Which one of youse won?
8694 : Curse you, Goblin... Was this your plan all along!?
8695 : You wanted to see us Yagudo fight each other while you gloated from afar...
8696 : Huh? Whaddya talkin' 'bout?
8697 : No, it is the exact opposite, in fact. Master Incantrix here wishes to be our friend.
8698 : Be our friend? Nonsense!
8699 : My beloved li'l brother want people, Goblins, Yagudo, and beastmen to all be friends!
8700 : So youse need to make up already! It don't matter who win or lose!
8701 : Hahahahaha! That's never going to happen!
8702 : Master Zhuu Buxu?
8703 : I lost... If that is not considered a failure, I don't know what is.
8704 : At any rate, I shall return to the Middle Lands and report to the Manifest. You can do as you please!
8705 : Urgh!
8706 : Master Zhuu Buxu...
8707 : Huh!? Nii Aquu won!? Youse earn yer freedom!?
8708 : Yes, but the Tengu sect may still refuse to take you in. I suggest you leave before you're found.
8709 : Hooray! Youse did it, Nii Aquu!
8710 : Kyah... No, it looks like I won't be so lucky...
8711 : Nii Aquu, I never expected that one as weak as you could defeat a trained assassin from the Middle Lands.
8712 : Furthermore, Master Zhuu Buxu... I am disappointed that you would admit defeat so readily.
8713 : Unlike you, my role is simple and clearly defined. It has nothing to do with the dealings between the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary.
8714 : I was sent to track down and capture this individual, and I failed. I am prepared to accept the punishment for my incompetence.
8715 : Yes, I can see that our cause is different, as is our resolve.
8716 : Justice must be served in order to secure the future of the Far East!
8717 : Gessho, why did you stop me!? You dare to stand in the way of justice!?
8718 : Commander Reikuu, much like you, I also seek to protect the future of the Far East.
8719 : However, I do not feel there is anything just about the path you are choosing to take here!
8720 : Given the current situation, you still speak such nonsense!? You think yours is the only correct path!?
8721 : No, I am still searching for my path as well. Commander Reikuu, if you would meditate with me...
8722 : Silence!
8723 : Hey, why's Tengu Yagudo after Nii Aquu?
8724 : It don't seem right! He's gotten stronger! That's what we need now--strong allies!
8725 : You are exactly right, Master Incantrix!
8726 : ...
8727 : Alas!
8728 : Hmm... It seems you will not listen to reason.
8729 : You leave me with no choice! %, I could use your assistance in this battle!
8730 : Lord Gessho...what rubbish you spew at times.
8731 : Ungh... How could I lose...
8732 : It is quite simple, really. I had % on my side.
8733 : Taking on powerful enemies requires you to have equally powerful allies.
8734 : Therefore, I feel that we should welcome Master Nii Aquu, who has grown considerably in strength, into the Tengu sect.
8735 : Hehehe... You never cease to amuse me.
8736 : Though you say that Nii Aquu has grown stronger, he is but a single individual.
8737 : And by sacrificing that one individual, we can gain the strength of an entire army of Yagudo through an alliance with the Theomilitary.
8738 : However, this lone individual came to Reisenjima with an uncommon determination to join the ranks of the Far East, did he not?
8739 : He engaged in unorthodox training methods, just so that he could gain the strength to be accepted here. Indeed, his actions more than lived up to his words.
8740 : Yeah! Youse said you were gonna get stronger! And so you did!
8741 : Urgh... If it weren't for the archpriest's specific instructions, I would deal with you personally...
8742 : Indeed. And why exactly did the archpriest specify that we are not to harm the Goblin?
8743 : Grrr...
8744 : He considers the Goblins living on Reisenjima to be citizens of the Far East...
8745 : Exactly. We need every citizen of the Far East to work together when it comes time to fight the monster that hatches from the egg.
8746 : There are more than just smoothskins and Yagudo living in the Far East, including various spirits and monsters as well.
8747 : The Mikado is constantly worried about how to best unite such disparate entities around a common goal.
8748 : However, he realizes now that good intentions alone may not be enough. And the Mikado and the archpriest are not wrong to think that.
8749 : Isn't that why they decided to enter talks with the Theomilitary about forming an alliance?
8750 : Yet because of those talks, we must turn our backs on those who already live here?
8751 : Grrr... I refuse to accept it, and I doubt the archpriest will either.
8752 : In fact, no one here will accept Nii Aquu as a citizen of the Far East!
8753 : The Tengu sect is as stubborn as ever, I see.
8754 : You may not accept it, but what about that Goblin over there? He is a citizen of the Far East too, is he not?
8755 : Ah, yes! I's accept it! I's accept Nii Aquu as my new brother!
8756 : Kyah-kyah!?
8757 : Wh-what did you say!?
8758 : My new brother! Nii Aquu, I hope youse ready for it!
8759 : I cannot believe this...
8760 : Give up already, Reikuu. Even I can see you've lost. Your path is not the right one.
8761 : Yet, what is to become of my mission to unite the Tengu sect and the Theomilitary...
8762 : Commander Reikuu... Join me, and together we will search for this Goblin hero who wields the black sword.
8763 : Rest assured, I have traveled extensively and am fluent in any language we might encounter.
8764 : Ah! I's just remembered somethin'! This is trouble! Big trouble!
8765 : Kyah-kyah!?
8766 : I's tried contactin' the Goblin hero!
8767 : But it's no use! No response! The hero, his friends...nowhere to be found!
8768 : What!? What about the black sword then!?
8769 : It's gone too... I's thinkin' it disappeared with the hero! So like I say, big trouble! There's nobody to smash the egg!
8770 : Kyah... Incantrix, is there any way to forge another one of these black swords?
8771 : Hmm... It is secret, known only to Goblins.
8772 : Although, youse become my Goblin brother today. I's can tell you, but everyone else, pretend to not listen.
8773 : Quawk! Quawk! Are you sure about this!?
8774 : Five thousand years ago, the evil Chaos tried to destroy all that was new, includin' the world itself.
8775 : Five thousand years ago, the strongest of these new beings joined forces.
8776 : But Chaos was strong. It die and come back many times. Die then reborn, die then reborn...
8777 : Chaos protected a powerful crystal, much stronger than power of the phoenix.
8778 : So, weapon more powerful than crystal needed to destroy it.
8779 : This special weapon require individual with strong soul.
8780 : So, bearer of the soul, wise Dvergar demon, create these black weapons.
8781 : Not just swords either, all kinds of weapons.
8782 : Also, not just Goblins carryin' them--all kinds of mighty beings.
8783 : But everyone vanish. Die in the battle against Chaos.
8784 : Only Goblin hero with black sword left.
8785 : That's all I's know.
8786 : Kyah... So the black sword was forged by a Dvergar demon...
8787 : Kyah-kyah! So if we ask another Dvergar, we just might be able to forge another black sword!
8788 : No! What if demon asks for yer soul in order to make blade!?
8789 : The Dvergar are not an easy lot to deal with. However...
8790 : The Theomilitary is familiar with demons from its experience forging an alliance with the Shadow Lord. As such, they may be able to negotiate a deal.
8791 : Furthermore, this could allow the Manifest to be viewed as a hero... It may go a long way in helping to cement the alliance between the two parties.
8792 : Master Incantrix, do you mind if we share this story with others?
8793 : Lalalala.
8794 : Indeed, Gessho. We only learned of this story because Nii Aquu was taken in as a Goblin.
8795 : If we mention that fact, it may be enough to get the Theomilitary to pardon him.
8796 : !?
8797 : Kyah-kyah! Thank you so much, Master Zhuu Buxu!
8798 : This way, I wouldn't have to admit that you bested me in battle, and I won't face punishment for my failure.
8799 : Master Zhuu Buxu, it seems I am in your debt once more.
8800 : What do you say, Reikuu? This solves everyone's problem, so I can't help but think it is the path we should take.
8801 : Very well. Time is of the essence, so I shall report to the archpriest immediately and prepare a letter for the Theomilitary.
8802 : Master Incantrix. Master Nii Aquu. I hope we can put this rather unfortunate business behind us.
8803 : Mwahaha. If it's fer my new brother, Nii Aquu, I's have no choice I guess!
8804 : Kyah-kyah, thank you so much.
8805 : %, please come pay me a visit later.
8806 : You recall that Reikuu told you to pay a visit later.
8807 : %, I would like to thank you for your assistance.
8808 : Furthermore, I must apologize for the impolite nature in which I have treated you.
8809 : Now that I think about it, our newfound harmony is all due to your efforts.
8810 : Thanks to you, we have formed a relationship with the Goblins and also managed to repair the divide between the Yagudo factions. In addition, we were also able to discover our previously lost history.
8811 : Gessho tells me that you are a mercenary and also an adventurer, and that you are unwilling to serve in the Far East ranks directly.
8812 : However, I would like to ask for your assistance once more when the impending danger finally reaches our shores.
8813 : In preparation for that day, I would like to present you with this symbol of our friendship.
8814 : Master! I also received one as well!
8815 : I have reported what transpired here to the archpriest.
8816 : He has ordered that in recognition of Nii Aquu's service, he be given the chance to officially join the Tengu sect.
8817 : Kyah-kyah! I know it will be difficult to adapt to the ways of the Far East, but I vow to do my best!
8818 : Although, Master Incantrix was slightly upset about the matter.
8819 : Since by joining the Tengu sect, I'm forced to give up my status as a Goblin...
8820 : Quawk! However, that doesn't change the fact that we're now brothers, so I'll still be doing what I can to help him!
8821 : As for the prime weapon and the war that took place five thousand years ago... He still has agreed to convey everything he knows to the Theomilitary.
8822 : Indeed... The more I learn about this battle against Chaos five thousand years ago, the more fearful I become...
8823 : We also can't overlook that the Goblin hero in possession of the black sword has gone missing. I wonder what happened to him...
8824 : %, if you hear any news of this Goblin hero in your travels, I ask that you bring word back to us at once.
8825 : As long as his status remains unknown, I feel there is a big piece to the puzzle that we are missing.
8826 : My, it seems a rather solemn mood has set in.
8827 : %, I would like to offer you this as a token of my appreciation for all that you have done.
8828 : Master! Please come back and assist with my training whenever you can spare a moment!
8829 : %, all that has been accomplished here we owe to you.
8830 : As such, it is only fitting that you receive a reward commensurate with your efforts.
8831 : %, all that has been accomplished here we owe to you.
8832 : Gessho informs me that you are an adventurer--perhaps a mercenary of sorts?--so it would be inappropriate of me to ask you to be a part of the Far East's standing forces...
8833 : ...but I would entreat you to assist us when the time comes.
