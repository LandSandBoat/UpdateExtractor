6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

6910 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
6911 : So far, we've only taken down # [enemy/enemies] today!
6912 : How many enemies have we defeated? Only #. You can count that high, right...?
6913 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
6914 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
6915 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
6916 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6917 : We've only beaten # [enemy/enemies] so far. Don't tell me you're tired already!?
6918 : Only # [enemy has/enemies have] fallen to us today! We're just getting started!
6919 : The last enemy we defeated was number #.
6920 : The last enemy we took down was number #.
6921 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
6922 : Only # [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
6923 : We've beaten at least two...right?
6924 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
6925 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
6926 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...
6927 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6928 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
6929 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
6930 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6931 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
6932 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
6933 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
6934 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
6935 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6936 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
6937 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
6938 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
6939 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
6940 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
6941 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6942 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
6943 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
6944 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
6945 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6946 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6947 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6948 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6949 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6950 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
6951 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7223 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7224 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7225 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7226 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7227 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7228 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7229 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7230 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7231 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7232 : You've earned conquest points!
7233 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7234 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7235 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7236 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7237 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7238 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7239 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7240 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7241 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7242 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7243 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7244 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7245 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7246 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7247 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7248 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7249 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7250 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7251 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7252 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7253 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7254 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7255 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7256 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7257 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7258 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7259 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7260 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7261 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7262 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7263 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7264 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7265 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7266 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7267 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7268 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.

7674 : You want to make %? In case you didn't already know, a volatile objectaru like that needs to be kept in a special container.
7675 : Such a container can be synthesized if you have two % and %. And if my memory serves me true, % serves as the bonding agentaru.
7676 : %, I hear, can be had within the Maze of Shakhrami. Not lying scattered about the floors, obviously. One of the crawlers there might be willing to partaru with one, but if not...well, you adventuring types know what to do.
7677 : Oh, did I mention %? Naturally, to synthesize %, you'll be needing one of those, too.
7678 : You wish to synthesize %? Ah, yes. Well do I know that recipe! Its creation requires a few %.
7679 : In turn, making % requires % and %. Toss % into the mix, and what you seek shall be yours.
7680 : I fear we haven't % here. But it should please you to know that skeletons dwelling within the Gusgen Mines are known to drop one on occasion.
7681 : What brings you here? Well, %, of all things... You couldn't hope to make one without some %, but I fear they aren't often stocked by vendors.
7682 : But you strike me as an intrepid type, so I'll share with you some knowledge to help you on your way. Head over to Ordelle's Caves. Hunt enough bats there, and you might just come into some %. That's the main ingredient required to make %.
7683 : All that remains, then, is to bind it with % using %. Good luck!
7684 : You... Yes, the description fits. I daresay, you're the one she sent, yes?
7685 : Can I count on you to aid my investigation once more?
7686 : At my client's behest, I have procured the item you require. But alas, doing so drained far more of my time and resources than had been reckoned. As recompense for having exerted undue effort, I would ask a favor of you. Do as I say, and you may consider the item yours.
7687 : Do as he says? Yes. No.
7688 : Very good. I knew I could count on us being on the same page.  Now then, without further ado, I shall explain the task to you. It truly is simple.
7689 : You are to investigate a number of creatures dwelling within the Sea Serpent Grotto in my stead.
7690 : Should you not possess % and %, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.
7691 : Using the % will turn % into %--a visual record of the subject's physical characteristics.
7692 : I'm currently investigating the %, the %, and the %.
7693 : Hm? It appears you are overburdened. Speak with me again after you've reorganized your belongings.
7694 : That is most disappointing... She would not be pleased to hear of this.
7695 : Ah, yes...
7696 : A truly menacing image of the %! All that remains, then, is one each of the % and the %.
7697 : Do you require % and %? I can provide you with both for a nominal fee of 800 gil.
7698 : Buy for 800 gil? (You have #) Yes, please. No, thank you.
7699 : Should you not possess % and %, I can furnish you with both for a nominal fee. I've recently depleted my stores, however, so you will have to wait until the next shipment arrives.
7700 : It appears you haven't enough gil.
7701 : Ah, a positively imposing image of the %! All that remains, then, is one of the %.
7702 : I've eagerly awaited your return. With this image of the %, I hold your task fulfilled.
7703 : As promised, I relinquish this to you. Should another be required, you shall find me here.
7704 : I need images of the %, the %, and the %.
7705 : You've yet to bring me images of the % and the %.
7706 : You've yet to bring me an image of the %.
7707 : A fine image this is, but this creature isn't one of my investigation subjects.
7708 : I fear I haven't the time to trade pleasantries with random strangers. Please leave me be.
7709 : Is there something else you wish of me? You already have what you came for, no?
7710 : We don't know what you're doing here, but truth be told, we're not really interested.
7711 : Putting up a fight, eh? Gorattz! Bompupu! Show [him/her] what the Tenshodo thinks of meddlesome adventurers!
7712 : D-damn... I'm in way over my head...
7713 : Ugh... [He/She]'s tougher than [he/she] looks...

7719 : From your ground bones, a loaf of bread we shall be baking.
7720 : We shall curse you unto death! Prepare to breathe your final breath!
7721 : We will make you beg to die! Six fulms under you will lie!
7722 : Naughty children shall receive no quarter! Curl up and die, this is your empress's order!
7723 : You've long overstayed your welcome! The punishment will be brutal and gruesome!
7724 : Which way do you like it--slow or fast? Should you lose a limb, be not aghast!
7725 : You'll wish you were never born! From your torso limbs will be torn!
7726 : Steel yourself for a wicked fright!
7727 : We shall set your pants alight!
7728 : The world shall bow before our might!
7729 : H-how could this be? This outcome, we did not foresee...
7730 : Be this a dream? Or is it real? This ending falls sorely short of ideal...
7731 : 'Twas high time you were made to know that your abilities are purely for show. Ohohohohoho!
7732 : A fitting end for a talentless crew that tried to bite off more than it could chew. Ohohohohoho!
7733 : Your body absorbs the power held within the ancient runes!

7739 : You are not in possession of a sap crystal. Unable to enter the battlefield for Battaru Royale.
7740 : The sap crystal has no effect. More time must elapse before you can enter the battlefield for Battaru Royale.
7741 : You are not in possession of a Tablet of Hexes. Unable to enter the battlefield for Project: Shantottofication.
7742 : The Tablet of Hexes has no effect. More time must elapse before you can enter the battlefield for Project: Shantottofication.
7743 : The door is sealed.
7744 : Your opponents deem you too weak to be worthwhile, disappearing whence they came.
7745 : You sense something strange...
7746 : The air around you is slightly stagnant...
7747 : The air around you has suddenly changed!
7748 : Don't you have something better to do right now?
7749 : %... A single fragment of light. The way in which it shines suggests that it is resonating with something...
7750 : Do you remove the %? Yes. No.
7751 : It is an oddly shaped stone monument. A shining stone is embedded in it, but cannot be removed...
7752 : You have already obtained this monument's %. Try searching for another.
7753 : You have obtained all of the fragments. You must hurry to the ruins of the ancient shrine!
7754 : You have obtained %! You now have all 8 fragments of light!
7755 : It is an ancient Zilart monument.
7756 : MONUMENT BOSS POP'N FRESH!
7757 : Touching the red jewel has infuriated the Opo-opos of the forest. It would be wise to leave immediately.
7758 : You put down the %.
7759 : Opo! Opo-opo-opo!      Oppopopo-opo!
7760 : Oppopo! Ohpopo!
7761 : Opopo!
7762 : The Opo-opo is holding something.
7763 : There must be a way to soothe the weary soul who once guarded this monument...
7764 : You place % on the monument as an offering.
7765 : ...tha...nk...you...
7766 : Something is lying on the ground.
7767 : The air in this area remains stagnant. You begin to feel sick... It would be wise to leave immediately.
7768 : The % begins to glow.
7769 : You will have to move closer to remove the %.
7770 : A cold wind chills you to the bone.
7771 : The Opo-opos attack!
7772 : There is a blackened spot on the ground...
7773 : This is the blackened spot you were told about. You should place % here.
7774 : You place % on the blackened spot.
7775 : You place % on the blackened spot, but nothing happens.
7776 : You have to be closer to place anything on the blackened spot.
7777 : This looks like a sturdy branch. You will need % to cut it off.
7778 : It is a beautiful, sturdy branch.
7779 : You feel as if you are being watched.
7780 : You can sense a strong, evil presence!
7781 : Some strange force is preventing you from cutting all the way through.
7782 : The strange force has vanished, and % has newly sprouted in the cut!
7783 : You no longer sense the evil presence, but there is still a feeling of unrest throughout the forest.
7784 : The newly sprouted % is glowing softly. You no longer feel as if you are being watched.
7785 : This is not the time for that!
7786 : The chewed remains of some insect larvae lie scattered about.
7787 : You must move closer to the edge to spread the contents of your %.
7788 : Isn't there something better you should be doing?
7789 : Nothing is happening.
7790 : A giant fish leaps out of the pond!
7791 : Something is lying by the edge of the pond.
7792 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
7793 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7794 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7795 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7803 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7804 : Carmelo said something about the hues of dusk...
7805 : I apologize. But...I could not stop thinking about the song.
7806 : Before you bury it...may I sing it one last time?
7807 : The earth does bloom with the fragrance of life, The sweet wind awakens us from our strife;
7808 : A miracle rides upon a gust of fate In tune with destiny, my true love awaits
7809 : The grace of the gods brings warmth to the lands And thus breathes life into its timeless sands
7810 : Miracles rain down from the heavens above And bestow their fine blessing unto my love.
7811 : My travels with Dariah once brought us here...
7812 : I can still remember that day. The landscape...
7813 : The soft rustle of the leaves... The rays of light, piercing the darkness of the towering trees... The wind on our cheeks...
7814 : But that has all changed. That which remains in my heart is nothing but a memory...and that is all it will ever be.
7815 : The sands of time never stop flowing. Not for me...or anyone.
7816 : That is what I've been trying to tell you.
7817 : That's why we have to make the most of what we are now. Even if that means facing hard times.
7818 : Dariah!?
7819 : How many years have passed since we last met...?
7820 : I heard from Gueravrel about what he made you do. I apologize for his foolishness.
7821 : But, here you are.
7822 : I knew that you would try hiding the song away from the rest of the world.
7823 : ...
7824 : It is a lovely melody. It takes me back to the time we traveled through these parts so many years ago.
7825 : Dariah... I...
7826 : Not a day has gone by that I did not think of you.
7827 : But I have changed. Your words and the words of this adventurer have transformed me into a new man.
7828 : Carmelo...
7829 : I've come to realize that even though we may be apart, you and I both breathe the same air...tread the same soil.
7830 : We must do our best to treasure the short amount of time we have been given on Vana'diel.
7831 : The time I spent with you... That is my treasure.
7832 : However, I know that many treasures await me still.
7833 : I now know that I must not live my life within my memories. I must set out and make memories anew.
7834 : I am ready to wind the hands of my clock once again, so that one day, our hands may meet again.
7835 : Carmelo... Thank you.
7836 : You finally understand what I tried to tell you long ago.
7837 : I have not forgotten the time we spent together. Those memories are my treasure as well.
7838 : I think that we adventurers are not meant to settle down in one place.
7839 : The time we share drives us to continue on in this vast world. That is why...
7840 : ...I look forward to the day...
7841 : ...when the hands of our clocks come together once again.
7842 : And I will be waiting, Dariah. When you see me again, I will be a new man.
7843 : Carmelo. There is one thing I want you to know.
7844 : No matter how far apart we may be, my heart will always be with you.
7845 : Dariah...
7846 : I...I do not know how to thank you. You have brought me so much.
7847 : It is not much, but please take this as a measure of my gratitude.
7848 : Now I shall head back to Bastok...and the new life that awaits.
7849 : I am the will of the realm's guardian wyrms made manifest, and in accordance with the Far Eastern calendar, this year belongs to us! May the soil be fertile and the harvests bountiful in the coming months.
7850 : I am the will of the realm's guardian wyrms made manifest, and in accordance with the Far Eastern calendar, this year belongs to us! May the following words guide you to fertile soils and bountiful harvests in the coming months.
7851 : What do we have here!? I cannot recall the last time I partook of a shell bug. Mmm...mhmmm...I had completely forgotten how vividly the flavor of these insects dances upon my palate. In return for your kind deed, adventurer, I impart to you the following... <Munch>...<smack>...
7852 : You currently stand in the eye of a raging maelstrom. Embark upon those winds and let them carry you to glory, obliterating all who dare defy you.
7853 : You exude a faint yet palpable aura of purification. Bathe your companions in the cleansing light to exorcise both their demons and yours.
7854 : The wheel of fate may creak and groan with age, but it spins in your favor. Where it stops, you shall find new alliances ready for the making.
7855 : Your corporeal frame is but a pyre that fuels an eternally burning spiritual conflagration. Use that passion to blaze your own trail to the path of righteousness.
7856 : You exude a comforting aura that blankets those around you. Wrap your companions in its warmth and their problems should melt away.
7857 : Your inner spirit is attuned to the sonorous melody that fortune emits. Lend it your ear in times of trouble, and you shall never lack for guidance.
7858 : You sense an ominous presence...
7859 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7860 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7861 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7862 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7863 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7864 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7865 : Now, listen close...
7866 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7867 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7868 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7869 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7870 : .........listen......
7871 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7872 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7873 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. Lovers in the Dusk. Soul Searching. Mandau. Mjollnir.
7877 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7878 : You hear a voice from out of nowhere...
7879 : You obtain # %!
7880 : ... At last we meet.
7881 : I have been freed from my prison and can soak up the sweat and blood of this world once more.
7882 : Wait, there is something I must...
7883 : This place is...?
7884 : I see... You must be the new wielder for these.
7885 : Yes, with your fighting spirit I believe you will be able to master the %.
7886 : The % have long accompanied me, along both rough and gentle paths. It is not easy to give them up, but...here.
7887 : They belong to you now. I ask that you consider my... Ah, but that is past now. I bid you farewell....
7888 : ...
7889 : I hope you don't think this is the end.
7890 : Your real life as a martial artist is just beginning. Time to start your training anew!
7891 : ... Finally! We finally meet face to face!
7892 : I have a presence in this world again! What an exhilarating feeling!
7893 : Ah yes, there is one more thing...
7894 : Eh? What?
7895 : Oh. You must be this one's new owner.
7896 : With your dagger skills, you'll make a perfect wielder for the %.
7897 : It is most difficult to give up a weapon that has seen me through so many tight spots, but you have earned it.
7898 : Treat her well...
7899 : ...
7900 : Splendid! From this day forth, I belong to you.
7901 : So, what kind of games shall we play? And where shall we go to play them? Who are we going to kill when we get there? It's all just too exciting...!
7902 : ... Thou hast found me.
7903 : I have now thrice shown my true form in this world.
7904 : A moment...
7905 : ... What has happened to me?
7906 : I see, you are the sword's new owner?
7907 : Well, this is most encouraging! A master of swordplay such as yourself should have no trouble wielding %.
7908 : When the world lies in chaos, this blade appears before the one meant to wield it. It is yours... Restore order to Vana'diel!
7909 : And now I, too, can rest unburdened...
7910 : ...
7911 : Thou art blessed this day.
7912 : Henceforth, I shall be thy blade. For the sake of thy companions, for justice in this world, wield my power in the name of honor...
7913 : ... You have found me.
7914 : Allow me to show my respect. You who have gained the strength of so many must be a true hero.
7915 : But first...
7916 : Who are you?
7917 : This must be some sort of joke. You are the new wielder of this weapon?
7918 : Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you. With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.
7919 : However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.
7920 : Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind. My regards go with you, stranger...
7921 : ...
7922 : Now, my heroic master...
7923 : For what purpose will you wield my power? The choices before you are without limit. Will you become the ruler of this world? Or perhaps...
7924 : ... You...me, meet.
7925 : Me...free... Thanks to you. Me, your...
7926 : Wait...
7927 : What the...?
7928 : Ah, now I see. The wheel has turned.
7929 : Truthfully spoken, I am thankful. % is a splendid axe, but ever does it hunger.
7930 : I have taken many lives to sate its need, and have reached the end of my strength.
7931 : You have my gratitude. You have freed me from my nightmare, and now I can sleep with a tranquil spirit...
7932 : ...
7933 : You, master, me. Good, work. Me, thank, you.
7934 : Master, me, hunger. Go, hunt? Find, prey? Me, cut, flesh. Break, bone. Drink, blood. Master, me, hunger...
7935 : ... Ah, you found me!
7936 : I have been freed from a world where life and death, reality and illusion are impossible to tell apart. I am truly grateful.
7937 : One moment...
7938 : ... This is...Jeuno!? Have I finally returned?
7939 : I... Nobody can see me. This is merely a reflection of reality. Which means you are the one to inherit the axe.
7940 : Hmm. With your polished skills, you will make a fine master for %.
7941 : The one who wields this axe must also be beautiful to look upon. Apparently, I was a suitable candidate. Do you not agree?
7942 : Congratulations. I expect you to perform great deeds from this day onwards. I also ask that someday you use % to avenge the Hydra Corps...
7943 : ...
7944 : I congratulate you also...my new master.
7945 : Now hold me high and let my blade glint in the sunlight! Let your friends, as well as your enemies, feast upon my glorious beauty!
7946 : ... You have found me.
7947 : My forbidden power is now yours, and I am liberated from my prison.
7948 : You have but to gain her respect...
7949 : Such a long dream I was having...
7950 : It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world. No. I must accept that it was no dream.
7951 : And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did... It seems you have already found your way to %.
7952 : Very well, I will pass it on to you. But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.
7953 : And think long and hard on whether or not this power should be used. Do not end up like me...
7954 : ...
7955 : Heh. Heh heh. Hahahahahahaha!
7956 : Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power? There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...
7957 : ... You have unearthed me at last.
7958 : I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.
7959 : All that remains is...
7960 : Hello? Is it possible that I...
7961 : But, no. I have not returned to this realm... You. You are to be my successor?
7962 : You certainly seem to have the required skill with the lance. Enough to convince % to lend you its power, at any rate.
7963 : Having this spear on the battlefield makes you a match for almost any opponent.
7964 : Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used. You have my admiration, adventurer. You have done well...
7965 : ...
7966 : The ceremony of inheritance is complete.
7967 : It is time for you to go forth and experience my overwhelming strength...
7968 : ... I have been rediscovered at last.
7969 : Thanks to you, I have made my escape from the shrouded land.
7970 : You must now gain the sanction of my master...
7971 : It is a pity, indeed.
7972 : This day has come far too soon for my liking.
7973 : However, you are a master of the ninja trade. I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the %.
7974 : Take this blade as your own. Travel far down the path of the ninja.
7975 : I will be watching you from the shadows...
7976 : ...
7977 : A fine master...
7978 : My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...
7979 : ... This day has finally come.
7980 : I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age. Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?
7981 : In any event...
7982 : What is going on here?
7983 : Ah, my successor has come.
7984 : I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the % and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.
7985 : When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.
7986 : You have my gratitude. Farewell, %...
7987 : ...
7988 : It has been a hard path to reach this point.
7989 : But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun. You have yet to attain perfection. Let us continue your training...
7990 : ... At long last, you have arrived.
7991 : I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...
7992 : You have proven me wrong...
7993 : I have heard of your coming.
7994 : You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?
7995 : Every time % is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor. I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.
7996 : However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now.  If you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.
7997 : Now, take the hammer and go! Just be careful with how you handle it. Do not let its might crush you as well...
7998 : ...
7999 : My might is yours to wield.
8000 : Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...
8001 : ... So, you have found me.
8002 : I must give you my thanks. I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.
8003 : And now...
8004 : Hwaah!
8005 : Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.
8006 : Well, it's for the best, I suppose. In my current state, % is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.
8007 : I entrust this staff to you! Take up %, %, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!
8008 : I take my leave of you now. I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...
8009 : ...
8010 : I am yours to wield.
8011 : But you are not yet my master. By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...
8012 : ... You have discovered my resting place.
8013 : The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more. My thanks.
8014 : Ah, one more test of your patience...
8015 : Where is this place?
8016 : Of course. How could I forget. I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.
8017 : Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary. % will fit snugly into your sure grasp.
8018 : However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke. You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.
8019 : Farewell...
8020 : ...
8021 : It is an honor to be owned by a just master. Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.
8022 : You are now the one to draw me in battle. I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.
8023 : ... We finally meet.
8024 : I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.
8025 : But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...
8026 : Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep. Oh, this place looks familiar...
8027 : Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?
8028 : You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And % would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...
8029 : Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.
8030 : This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...
8031 : ...
8032 : A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.
8033 : Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...
8034 : ... I am saved.
8035 : Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!
8036 : A few more moments, if you please...
8037 : Hello there. I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.
8038 : You've never heard of me? Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.
8039 : To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the %, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.
8040 : But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.
8041 : She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...
8042 : ...
8043 : He was a wonderful performer.
8044 : Let us be on our way. Our tour of the world has only just begun...
8045 : Hm? What is this? %? How do I know this is not some [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] trick?
8046 : Step back, adventurer! I've got much more important things to worry about now!
8047 : What!? A surprise attack by the beastmen!? And today, of all days...
8048 : In a matter of hours, a handful of new squires will be joining our ranks here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8049 : These young patricians are quite spirited, but they lack valuable battle experience.
8050 : While we need be cautious not to disgrace their family names, we cannot let them fall in battle. We request your assistance in protecting the future of San d'Oria!
8051 : It will not be long before a caravan of traders in search of new trade routes arrives here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8052 : If they were to be injured by the enemy, the economy of San d'Oria could fall into chaos. We request your assistance in protecting the prosperity of our kingdom!
8053 : A group of Temple Knights is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe our daily work.
8054 : Ah, but perhaps this could be a perfect chance to show those pampered sissies that being a true knight comprises more than just chasing about shoplifters and sweeping the chateau gardens. However, no matter how much of a grudge we may hold, we cannot let our Elvaan brothers and sisters fall in battle. Understood?
8055 : In a matter of moments, members of the Royal Guards will be arriving here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare us for our next campaign against the beastmen.
8056 : If the fiends are conniving a surprise attack, I expect you to do your best in assuring that no disgrace will be brought upon the guards' names, as well as preventing any unnecessary bloodshed.
8057 : Today, our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] is blessed with the honor of welcoming an ambassador from the fine Republic of Bastok.
8058 : If anything were to happen to our guest, it could transpire into war between our two nations. I expect you to protect the attach with your very life!
8059 : In a few moments, a new batch of legionary recruits will be enlisted to the Republican Army and dispatched here to the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8060 : However, within their ranks are future scientists and craftsmen. Their deaths would be a great loss for the future of our nation.
8061 : We must ensure their safety, but we also must be careful not to prevent them from fulfilling their duties. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8062 : In a matter of minutes, a group of mariners will be arriving at our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] for self-defense training.
8063 : We must provide them with battle experience, but we also must ensure their safety. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8064 : My sources indicate that a party of Gold Musketeers carrying supplies is approaching the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8065 : These soldiers are the best of the best, and more than likely will not require any assistance in the event of an attack. However, if anything were to happen to them...
8066 : Later today, a group of high-ranking officials from Strategic Command will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare for Bastok's next campaign against the beastmen.
8067 : If anything were to happen to the commanders, you and I would both be court-martialed! The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8068 : I have just received word that a group of ambassadors from the Federation of Windurst is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe what measures Bastok has undertaken to maintain stability in the regions under Republican control.
8069 : If the attachs were to be injured on this occasion, the damage suffered to our nations' relationship would be irreparable. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8070 : Shortly, we will be conducting a test for our mercenary candidates here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8071 : This exam is to help us judge the candidates' skill in battle and help us separate those with talent from those who are bound for deskwork.
8072 : But after an attack by the beastmen...there won't be any candidates left to grade! You've got to help us give these kids a fighting chance!
8073 : It won't be long before a party of Federation scholars will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to do research on the local wildlife.
8074 : These scientists are more powerful with their pens than their swords...but that won't help them against a beastman attack! You've got to help us protect them!
8075 : Hmmm... Later today, a small group of Wize Wizards will be arriving to observe our daily work here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8076 : I say that we give them something to remember! %! It's up to you to prove to those bigwigs that we are the ones who maintain the peace in the Federation! Give those beastmen all you've got! (Just don't let the Wize Wizards get hurt...)
8077 : Today, a party of Federation Patriarchs is scheduled to arrive at the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to plan for Windurst's next campaign against the beastmen.
8078 : If anything were to happen to them, we'd all be reassigned to latrine duty! If you know what's good for you, you won't let anyone lay a finger on them!
8079 : Oh, why did the military attachs from San d'Oria have to come to our outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] now?
8080 : I shudder to think what would happen if an ambassador was injured...or worse! Get out there and protect those Elvaan with your life!
8081 : Excellent work! Your efforts helped protect the future of our nation. Divide this among your companions.
8082 : Our nation suffered an enormous loss today. We must begin reinforcing our defenses immediately!
8083 : Your inability to complete the mission has led to our defeat. The last thing our nation needs is an incompetent adventurer!

8085 : We commend you on your services in helping us avert the beastmen's attack. I do not see them attacking us again any time soon.

11327 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11328 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
11329 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
11330 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
11331 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
11332 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
11333 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
11334 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
11335 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
11336 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
11337 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
11338 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
11339 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
11340 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
11341 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
11342 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
11343 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
11344 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
11345 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
11346 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
11347 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
11348 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.

11353 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
11354 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
11355 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
11356 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!

11361 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
11362 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
11363 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
11364 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
11365 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
11366 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
11368 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
11369 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
11370 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
11371 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
11372 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
11373 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
11374 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
11375 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
11376 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
11377 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
11378 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

11440 : The atmacite could not be purged...

11445 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
11446 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
11447 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
11448 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11449 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11450 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11451 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11452 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11453 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11454 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11455 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11456 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11457 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11458 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11459 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11460 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11461 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11462 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11463 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11464 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11465 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11466 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11467 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11468 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11469 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11470 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11471 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11472 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11473 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11474 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11475 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11476 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11477 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11478 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11479 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11480 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11481 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11482 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11483 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11484 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11485 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11486 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11487 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11488 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11489 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
