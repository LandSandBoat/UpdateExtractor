6617 : Meow!
6618 : [/It might be time to head back to town./I have to be heading back soon./My reflexes are starting to slow./I believe it's almost time for a rest./A nice soft bed is looking good about now./We've been at this for a while now./Sorry, but I have some other chores to take care of./I'm starting to get kinda tired./I believe it's almost time for a rest.] [/I think I need a rest./Other duties call!/We should call it a day pretty soon./Shall we head back to town shortly?/Shall we call it quits soon?/I think I have enough energy for one last spurt!/Can we finish up here soon?/But I can keep going for a little while! <Yawn>.../Shall we head back to town shortly?]
6619 : It might be time to head back to town. I think I need a rest.
6620 : I have to be heading back soon. Other duties call!
6621 : My reflexes are starting to slow. We should call it a day pretty soon.
6622 : I believe it's almost time for a rest. Shall we head back to town shortly?
6623 : I've almost had enough for one day.
6624 : Whoops! Forgot to tell you, but I have to be somewhere soon.
6625 : I regret to inform you that my presence will be required in town shortly. I pray you do not think ill of me.
6626 : A nice soft bed is looking good about now. Shall we call it quits soon?
6627 : We've been at this for a while now. I think I have enough energy for one last spurt!
6628 : Sorry, but I have some other chores to take care of. Can we finish up here soon?
6629 : I'm starting to get kinda tired. But I can keep going for a little while! <Yawn...>
6630 : I believe it's almost time for a rest. Shall we head back to town shortly?
6631 : I've babysitted you long enough for one day. I will leave soon.
6632 : This is getting borrring...
6633 : [/We've been through a good number of enemies./I think I'm finally getting tired./We've done enough today, I think./We've proved ourselves in battle this day./Phew, I'm beat./Maybe just one more battle./We should call it day./Phew!

6634 : We've been through a good number of enemies. One more ought to do it.
6635 : I think I'm finally getting tired. Should we make the next battle our last?
6636 : We've done enough today, I think. Let's make the next battle our last.
6637 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6638 : <Puff, wheeze> Just one more battle, okay?
6639 : I'm starting to feel sorry for our opponents! Think I'll call it a day after the next one.
6640 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6641 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6642 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6643 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6644 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6645 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6646 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6647 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6648 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6652 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6653 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6654 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6655 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6656 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6657 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6658 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6659 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6660 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6661 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6662 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6663 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6664 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6665 : A parting gift!
6666 : Ha!
6667 : Back to the pit with you!
6668 : The tide of battle turns!
6669 : How do you like this!?
6670 : I saved this just for you!
6671 : I believe it is my turn!
6672 : Your time is up!
6673 : Time for action!
6674 : This battle is ours!

6677 : Taste my wrath!
6678 : Hisss! Superrr...attack!

6683 : I'm prepared for battle.
6684 : I feel good!

6687 : I'm ready to fight anytime.
6688 : I'm good to go!
6689 : I'm ready when you are.
6690 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6691 : I'm prepared for battle.
6692 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.
6693 : I feel grrreat! Come on, let me at them!
6694 : [/Don't worry about me./No problem!/Nothing to worry about./Don't hold back on my account./This little scratch?/This little scratch?/Nice of you to worry./No problem!/Don't hold back on my account.] [/It's just a scratch./This is just a scratch!/Just a scratch./This is a mere scratch./Pay it no mind./I've had bigger paper cuts!/But I'm fine, it's just a scratch./This little scratch won't slow me down!/This is a mere scratch.]
6695 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6696 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6697 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6698 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6699 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6700 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6701 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6702 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6703 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6704 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6705 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6706 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6707 : I would hardly call this a scratch. Don't mind me, mind yourself.

6710 : I should probably rest a little more. Just in case.
6711 : I'm not gonna let a slight wound like this keep me down! I'm ready for more!
6712 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6713 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6714 : I'm fine...really.
6715 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6716 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6717 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6718 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6719 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6720 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.
6721 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6722 : Hm... Our opponents are quite determined to make us work.
6723 : Around five out of nine lives rrremaining!

6725 : We should really take a break. I'm not ready for another battle.
6726 : I feel a little...lightheaded. Maybe we should take a break.
6727 : That last fight took it out of me. Let me catch my breath.
6728 : Let's take a break, shall we? No sense rushing into battle in this condition.
6729 : I need to take a break soon.
6730 : Hey, how about taking five?
6731 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6732 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6733 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6734 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6735 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...
6736 : Let's take a break, shall we? No sense rushing into battle in this condition.
6737 : <Puff> Tell me if you feel...you need rest... <Pant> I mean it...
6738 : Around three out of nine lives rrremaining...

6743 : I'm at my limit. Please let me recover my strength.
6744 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6745 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6746 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6747 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6748 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6749 : Please... I need to sit down...
6750 : Can't...fight...any...longer... Must...rest...
6751 : I'm at my limit. Please let me recover my strength.
6752 : The enemy isn't going anywhere. Withdraw and regroup!

6770 : Hmm. Better keep an eye on my magic reserves.
6771 : Let's see now. I think my magic is about half gone.
6772 : My magic? It might be time to rest soon.
6773 : My magical reserves? Depleted to about the halfway mark.
6774 : I have around half of my magic left.
6775 : My magic is good for a while yet.
6776 : My magical reserves should suffice for now, but we best avoid taking unnecessary risks.
6777 : Are you relying on my magic? If so, we may need to rest soon.
6778 : I still have lots of magic left! Well, maybe half...
6779 : My magic? It might be time to keep an eye on my reserves.
6780 : Hmmm. I've used up half my magic already...

6803 : I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
6804 : I've just leveled up, but with your help, it'll take no time at all to get to the next level!
6805 : Hey, I just leveled up, didn't I? Easy on the expectations there, partner.
6806 : Since I have just gained a level, it will be quite some time until I reach the next. Sorry to disappoint you, [sir/milady].
6807 : I've just gained a level. The next level is still quite a way off.
6808 : I just gained a level! You can't expect me to level again any time soon!

6810 : I've just gained a level, I know. But I still can't wait until I go up again!
6811 : I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
6812 : I just leveled up! We'll have to do something about your memory problem.

6817 : Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
6818 : There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
6819 : I still have to gain lots more experience, but I'll do my best!
6820 : My next level is still ages away. Why hurry? Don't worry, be happy!
6821 : I have made some progress, but the next level still eludes me.
6822 : Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
6823 : I have lots of work to do! I need more experience if I'm gonna get stronger!
6824 : I still have much to do. I must gain more experience in order to grow stronger.
6825 : Ho-hum. Still lots of work to do until my next level!
6826 : There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
6827 : My level won't rise if we stand around talking like this!
6828 : No, don't rrremind me!  Such a long way to go...

6832 : Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
6833 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6834 : I think I'm about half way there...
6835 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6836 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6837 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
6838 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
6839 : I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.

6841 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6842 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.

6847 : Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
6848 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6849 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
6850 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
6851 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
6852 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
6853 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
6854 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
6855 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
6856 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6857 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
6858 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?

6860 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
6861 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
6862 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
6863 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6864 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6865 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6866 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6867 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6868 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6869 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6870 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6871 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6872 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6873 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6874 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6875 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6876 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6877 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6878 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6879 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6880 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6881 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6882 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6883 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6884 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6885 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6886 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6887 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6888 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6889 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6890 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6891 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6892 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6893 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6894 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6895 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6896 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6897 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6898 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6899 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...

6980 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6981 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6982 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6983 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6984 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
