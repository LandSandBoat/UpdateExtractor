6732 : The hunt registry is a tome through which veteran soldiers can undertake assignments to eliminate monsters deemed to be impediments to S.M.A.N. activities.
6733 : Assignments, or hunts, can be undertaken simply by selecting the name of a monster listed in the registry.
6734 : Pertinent information such as monster elusiveness and ferocity has been recorded for your reference. As safety cannot be guaranteed, we ask that you hunt within your ability.
6735 : Hunts pit you against creatures of extreme ferocity, and are not intended for training. For this reason, you cannot undertake a hunt while a training regime is active.
6736 : Should party members undertaking a common hunt defeat the objective, the kill will be considered valid for all.
6737 : Upon the completion of a hunt, record your success in a hunt registry. Doing so will earn you rewards corresponding to difficulty as well as scylds--tokens of your valor.
6738 : More scylds will grant you access to increasingly difficult and rewarding assignments. Be warned, however, that once expended, scylds will not be refunded for any reason.

9828 : You... I thought you had perished!
9829 : Hmph. I see the boy is not with you...
9830 : Very well. Let us put our differences aside for the moment. However, I suggest that you do not make any sudden movements, as we are being watched...
9831 : Travelers. This place is nothing but a memory fleeting on the edge of time. There is little we have to offer outsiders.
9832 : And so I must ask of you these questions: From where have you come, and to where do you go? If your conscience is clean and your intentions just, you should have no reason not to provide me with answers.
9833 : Yeah! Prove that you're innocent!
9834 : Yeah! A fight to the death!
9835 : What, you say that these Tarutaru stole something from you?
9836 : But that was...
9837 : Ow-ow-ouch!
9838 : Stealing items from an unconscious stranger! What were you three thinking!?
9839 : But that amulet is Prishe's! I bet that funny-looking adventurer stole it from her!
9840 : It does closely resemble the one Prishe had in her possession...
9841 : Amulet!? So that explains...
9842 : We shall wait for Prishe's return. She will know whether the amulet is hers or not. Until that time, I suggest that you rest here in the safehold.
9843 : However, remember that you are not welcome, and the moment the issue at hand is solved, you will be asked to leave and never come back.
9844 : Welcome to our humble city, though there is little left of it... I heard from Justinius the details of your predicament.
9845 : He mentioned that you were from the mainland.
9846 : Tell me, what is the situation beyond the churning seas?
9847 : I see... [The lord of the beastmen has returned and/Even after the Shadow Lord's defeat,] the struggle for peace continues.
9848 : No one has the time to wonder about the fates of their lost brothers...
9849 : This is Tavnazia... A new Tavnazia, built from the ruins of the once mighty Marquisate. For twenty years, the survivors of the Great War toiled to create what you see here.
9850 : For twenty years, we have dug and carved our way up from a narrow storageway below the Tavnazian Cathedral...
9851 : As an adventurer, I am sure you have heard tales of the Pearl of Zafmlug--the renowned Tavnazian Marquisate.
9852 : Her wide harbors would welcome ships from all corners of Vana'diel, carrying never-before-seen goods and treasures.
9853 : A mecca of trade. A place where dreams of wealth and success could become reality... It was the golden age of Tavnazia.
9854 : But it all came to a close twenty years ago. The beastman hordes concentrated their attack on our fair nation, and when they were through, there was nothing left but a wasteland uninhabitable by even the foulest of creatures.
9855 : We, too, should have met the same fate as the Marquisate...
9856 : Late in our escape from the peninsula, we made for the cathedral, where we awaited our deaths at the hands of the Orcs.
9857 : However, it was not the Orcs who arrived, but the cardinal, Mildaurion C Giloumet.
9858 : She tended to our wounded bodies and spirits, and informed us how to escape.
9859 : She opened the gates to the lower parts of the cathedral, and told us to follow the delivery tunnels to the city.
9860 : We did as we were told, and it was not long before we arrived at the subterranean harbor deep beneath this place.
9861 : However, by the time we had arrived, the boats had already gone, and a terrible explosion had destroyed the landbridge to Quon... We were trapped...
9862 : But even with our backs against the wall of despair, the courage and faith we had received from the cardinal remained in our hearts.
9863 : For the past twenty years we have survived on the belief that Altana will save us. It is that belief that has helped us to come together and rebuild our nation.
9864 : However, we still struggle to provide for even ourselves. I am sorry we cannot offer you any more than a warm welcome.
9865 : But please, feel free to utilize any of our facilities.
9866 : I pray that the powers that led you to Tavnazia become a blessing for both our peoples.
9867 : I realize that back on the mainland, no one has the time to wonder about the fates of their lost brothers.
9868 : However, I pray that the powers that led you to Tavnazia turn out to be a blessing for both our peoples.
9869 : ...By the way, where is the other traveler that arrived with you here in the safehold?
9870 : I wish to hear his tales of the mainland as well...
9871 : You say that Nag'molada fellow is not an acquaintance of yours?
9872 : Well, that is of no matter. If you happen to see him again, I strongly suggest you warn him not to go anywhere near the door leading to the aqueducts.
9873 : So this is what remains of the mighty nation of Tavnazia... Its people alone behind these walls, struggling to stay alive for the past twenty years...
9874 : Hey you! We know who you really are! Tell us who you really are!
9875 : You're one of those bad, bad rogues!
9876 : You're one of those red lion traitors!
9877 : You're one of those evil black mages!
9878 : It's time for you to be punished!
9879 : Is this any place for the Defenders of Tavnazia to be?
9880 : I thought you were supposed to be guarding the city in Prishe's absence.
9881 : What if she were to find out that you were wandering about outside, leaving the safehold vulnerable to an attack? I could inform her when she returns...
9882 : You wouldn't do that, Justinius!
9883 : You couldn't do that, Justinius!
9884 : I ask that you two keep your distance from that gate.
9885 : On the other side lie the Phomiuna Aqueducts, located beneath the cathedral. It was once a peaceful place. However, now it is nothing more than a haven for fiends.
9886 : There are even rumors that a terrible minotaur has taken nest in the aqueducts' depths.
9887 : It is only a matter of time before the beast breaks through the gate and comes to terrorize our city. There have been talks of sending a party down to slay the monster; however, we cannot take action until Prishe has returned.
9888 : The Tavnazian Cathedral...
9889 : I know! We can use these two as bait for the minotaur!
9890 : Yeah! They'll surely be sentenced to death once Prishe gets back, right?
9891 : If they're gonna die anyway, why not put them to good use!?
9892 : Quiet, you three!
9893 : You need not worry. I doubt your punishment will be that harsh.
9894 : In the past, there have been others like you who washed up on our shores. Most of them still reside amongst us.
9895 : No... Why not let us attempt to rid your city of its pest problem?
9896 : What is this you say?
9897 : Adventurers travel the world in search of new challenges. If defeating this minotaur can help us gain the trust of your people, we would be fools not to try.
9898 : Do you really think you will be able to defeat the monster?
9899 : The aqueducts that lie beneath the Tavnazian Cathedral's Sacrarium have had a powerful magic spell cast upon them by the cardinal Mildaurion C Giloumet.
9900 : This magic limits the strength of the monsters that roam down there, but unfortunately affects anyone else who chooses to enter.
9901 : I do not know the extent of your skills in this world, but I can guarantee things will not be the same once you pass through that gate.
9902 : Accept the challenge? Yes. No.
9903 : [He/She] is tired from recent ordeals and [his/her] mind is still clouded. However, you need not fear. [He/She] will defeat the minotaur. I guarantee it.
9904 : Understood. This key will open the gate and allow you passage to the aqueducts. We shall see if you are to be trusted.
9905 : However, I warn you. Do not venture deeper than you must, for great evil lurks in the darkness. There will be no rescue parties in the event that you fail to return.
9906 : Beyond that gate lie the aqueducts that connect to the deeper parts of the Sacrarium. The entire area has had a powerful magic spell cast upon it by the cardinal Mildaurion C Giloumet.
9907 : This magic limits the strength of monsters that roam down there, but unfortunately affects anyone else who chooses to enter. Do not venture any further than is absolutely necessary.
9908 : You have defeated the minotaur? But your companion has yet to return.
9909 : It's not that I doubt your word, but I must hear the story from both of you. Now, back into the aqueducts to search for your friend.
9910 : I can't believe you actually managed to slay that beast. It seems I have underestimated you.
9911 : Those who reside here live in constant fear of monsters, so it is with glad hearts that we welcome stalwart heroes such as yourself.
9912 : Ah, your timing is excellent. Our leader has returned.
9913 : I'm back!
9914 : Prishe! You're safe!
9915 : You were gone so long, we were starting to worry.
9916 : You wouldn't believe the hell I've been through!
9917 : Listen up, you lot! A bunch of nasty critters have gathered on Cape Riverne.
9918 : I'd keep away from that place if you like your organs on the inside of your body. Those monsters don't play nice.
9919 : What's this? What is going on out there?
9920 : Prishe, I saw a weird cloud stretching out towards Cape Riverne. Do you have any idea of what it was?
9921 : Oh, that. I just caught a glimpse of it, but I'm pretty sure that was the vapor trail of some huge goddamn dragon.
9922 : But don't you worry your little heads about it. I'm going out again after I check our provisions.
9923 : Heh heh! And this time I'm gonna head in a whole lot further.
9924 : By the way, have any of you seen Justinius?
9925 : There you are, Prishe! Sorry to bother you right after you get back, but you need to take a look at what the cat dragged in!
9926 : Two people have washed up on the Lufaise Meadows...
9927 : Castaways?
9928 : It seems our guests have noticed the attention.
9929 : What's with that getup? Someone from the mainland?
9930 : Prishe, that one had collapsed in front of the eastern caves.
9931 : [He/She] was carrying an amulet just like yours.
9932 : What's that? An amulet like mine!?
9933 : [He/She] stole your amulet, Prishe! We should hang [him/her] upside down off a cliff! Rotten thief!
9934 : You idiots! What do you think this is, huh?
9935 : Uh? Uh-oh...
9936 : You guys have screwed up again!
9937 : Run!
9938 : Flee!
9939 : Exit stage left!
9940 : But why would [he/she] have the same kind of amulet...?
9941 : Prishe, listen to me. These two could be of some use.
9942 : While you were away, they defeated that minotaur in the aqueducts by themselves.
9943 : Huh. Not too shabby. Guess we'd better welcome them on board, then.
9944 : I'm Prishe. I'll be in my quarters, so drop on by later and say hi.
9945 : Were you surprised when you met Prishe? She might look like a little girl, but she's the strongest member of the Tavnazian Patrol.
9946 : It is strange that you should carry the same amulet. It seems that fate has taken a hand here.
9947 : But Prishe despises words like fate. You should head to her quarters before she starts to get impatient.
9948 : So you finally decided to show up. I've heard all about you from Justinius. Sounds like you've had a hell of a time since you got here.
9949 : But I'm not one to pry. To put it in other words, I just don't give a damn.
9950 : But there is one thing that's been bugging me. Where did you get your hands on this amulet?
9951 : A white-haired boy? That's strange... Are you sure you don't mean a tall blonde chick?
9952 : Anyway, I'm not a thief, so you can have this back.
9953 : What did you...
9954 : Prishe, do you have a moment?
9955 : What's wrong, Despachiaire? You never come to my quarters.
9956 : I'm the abhorrent one. I thought if you talked to me you'd be punished by the goddess.
9957 : ...
9958 : Whatever. Anyway, what is it that you want?
9959 : I heard of what transpired on Cape Riverne--that a great dragon appeared.
9960 : That's exactly what happened! I'd never seen anything like it. If that monster decided to attack us, there wouldn't be a trace of this place left.
9961 : Prishe... Do you think that the dragon you saw may be the same one portrayed in the painting of Al'Taieu?
9962 : Al'Taieu?
9963 : Do you not remember the painting brought back by Grezzo from the Tenshodo?
9964 : Cardinal Mildaurion told us of the tale that unfolded on the canvas.
9965 : But if the dragon I saw was the same as in the painting, then that would mean the beast was...Bahamut!?
9966 : I've got to check this out! You, find Ulmia and bring her back here quick!
9967 : You're looking for Ulmia? Sorry, I haven't seen her. Try asking Justinius, he might know something.
9968 : Ulmia? I just saw her leaving the safehold. Any time she wants to be alone, Ulmia usually goes to Snowmint Point, located on the Misareaux Coast...
9969 : Prishe! Did you look at the sky!? Something left a second strange trail...and the trail leads right to Cape Riverne!
9970 : Yeah, I saw it. Left by another dragon, right? How many of those things are there, anyway?
9971 : Prishe... I still do not know if I can believe what you have just told me.
9972 : Have the Gates of Paradise truly begun to open...?
9973 : How the hell should I know? That's why we're going to ask Bahamut, right?
9974 : Everybody, listen up! We're heading to Riverne! Anybody with enough guts to come with me, step forward!
9975 : Hm... You'd think at least those troublemaking Tarutaru would want to come. Where are they, anyway?
9976 : Yes, where could they have run off to?
9977 : Now that you mention it, that stranger is not here, either.
9978 : Wait a second--I just saw him outside. The creepy-looking guy in the black robe, right?
9979 : Where did you say you saw him?
9980 : I saw the stranger as well. He was speaking with the three Tarutaru.
9981 : Prishe, they packed their bags and left the safehold a few minutes ago!
9982 : Huh!? Why, those conniving...!
9983 : Do you think they could have set off for Cape Riverne? But why...?
9984 : There's only one reason. They smell an adventure! C'mon! We've got no time to lose!
9985 : The Chebukki brothers were headed to Cape Riverne, northwest of the Misareaux Coast.
9986 : Those three were carved out of pure curiosity. Once they'd heard about the dragon sightings, they probably couldn't wait to go see it for themselves.
9987 : But why did your companion go with them? When did he become such good friends with those troublemakers?
9988 : Phew... It's good to be back home!
9989 : What's with the long faces? I'm back! Break out the brew and grub!
9990 : ...? Something is amiss, Prishe...
9991 : Prishe! Ulmia! You are all right!
9992 : What's going on here, Justinius? Did anything happen while I was gone?
9993 : Well...
9994 : Prishe, Ulmia. Please come with me. There is something we must speak of.
9995 : Granpere...
9996 : Greetings, %. Thanks to your actions on the mainland, a messenger from Jeuno has arrived here in Tavnazia.
9997 : It looks like arrangements will be made for aiding the safehold. Their government will also be considering applications from those who wish to emigrate to Jeuno.
9998 : The only problem is... Have you talked to Prishe yet?
9999 : Ah, %. Welcome back to the safehold.
10000 : This may sound odd, but on behalf of the residents of Tavnazia, I would like to thank you.
10001 : Were it not for your arrival on this island, we would have more than likely been trapped here until our deaths--our existence unknown to those back on the mainland.
10002 : And to think that I would be reunited once again with my granddaughter... There is nothing I could say or do that could express my gratitude.
10003 : May I enter?
10004 : Why, if it is not a messenger from the Far East. You must be exhausted from your long journey.
10005 : Welcome to our humble town. My name is Despachiaire, Ulmia's grandfather.
10006 : I thank you for your warm welcome. Tenzen, at your service.
10007 : I traveled across the seas to Jeuno in hopes of meeting Lord Bahamut. While there, I was fortunate enough to make acquaintances with both Ulmia and Prishe.
10008 : However, my mission is not yet complete. I request permission to leave the safehold so that I may continue my journey in search of the conqueror of the skies.
10009 : I see. So you wish to speak with Bahamut...
10010 : I apologize, but I must ask you to refrain from visiting the avatar at the moment.
10011 : Bahamut has built a nest but a few malms from this safehold. If anyone or anything were to disturb him, the results could be catastrophic for Tavnazia.
10012 : The diplomat from Jeuno, Nag'molada, should be returning from the Sacrarium shortly.
10013 : I request that you accompany him on his journey to Bahamut's lair.
10014 : Until then, feel free to rest within our city's walls. We shall try our best to meet any of your needs.
10015 : A diplomat from Jeuno...? Understood. I shall wait here until he arrives.
10016 : ...Sir Despachiaire, may I ask why I am not allowed to speak with Lady Prishe?
10017 : There is something I must ask her. However, when I attempted to enter her room, she became upset and sent me away.
10018 : I apologize for her actions. While it may not show, Prishe is cursed by a terrible sickness.
10019 : I wish she would stay in the safehold and rest, but that personality of hers will not let her do so. I am amazed her body holds at all...
10020 : Now that Nag'molada has promised the revival of trade talks with Jeuno, Tavnazia needs Prishe to be healthy.
10021 : I see... I did not know that the situation was so grave--did you, %?
10022 : Sir Despachiaire, I will comply with your request regarding my journey to Bahamut. Please inform me when the diplomat has returned and further arrangements have been made.
10023 : This is not good, %. I must meet with Bahamut before Jeuno dispatches its army.
10024 : However, my hands are tied unless I can find Ulmia and speak with Lady Prishe.
10025 : It is thanks to Prishe that our nation has grown strong over the past twenty years. Without her, we would not be where we are today.
10026 : Her presence is a special one--a miracle bestowed upon us by the Dawn Goddess. However, there are now rumors that the miracle is about to fade... What will become of Tavnazia...?
10027 : You are looking for Ulmia? She probably went down to the coast. I must say, it is quite uncommon for her to argue with her grandfather like she did earlier...
10028 : %, you weren't able to dissuade Ulmia?
10029 : She's determined to march up Cape Riverne and speak to the Wyrmking, alone if need be. She won't listen to me, no matter how much I try to explain the dangers involved.
10030 : I understand how much she wants to prove that Prishe is not the abhorrent one, but...
10031 : %. If you are searching for Ulmia and Tenzen, they just entered the elder's quarters.
10032 : %, I am pleased to see you have returned.
10033 : I spoke with Despachiaire about Bahamut's words. However, I do not know how much he believed...
10034 : People often have a tendency to block out truths that are too terrible to face. That Bahamut and his minions will destroy all mankind--all of us would wish this to simply be a nightmare from which we will eventually awake.
10035 : I, myself, have trouble coming to terms with what I heard. The Keeper of the Apocalypse... The pact...
10036 : When the keeper is born, the children of Altana must die...
10037 : Why would Bahamut wish such a terrible fate upon us? What caused him to despise us this much?
10038 : Lady Ulmia... Do you remember when Bahamut sang? At that moment, my blade, Phoenix, enlightened me.
10039 : Long ago, our ancestors, the ancients, fought many a great battle with the terrestrial avatars.
10040 : Among those battles, the most fierce and drawn-out was that fought by Bahamut over the opening of the Gates of Paradise.
10041 : It was during that fight that people learned of the Emptiness...
10042 : The Emptiness... The will of Promathia!
10044 : However, I know little of the Twilight God.
10045 : Lady Ulmia! Will you not give us insight into this deity's connection with Vana'diel and its children?
10046 : I...
10047 : I apologize, sir. However, that is something we are forbidden to speak of...
10048 : Forbidden...?
10049 : Traveler from the East, let me explain.
10050 : Promathia... Simply speaking his name brings damnation.
10051 : ...!
10052 : As has the Dawn Goddess, Altana, the Twilight God has existed since the beginning of time.
10053 : However, unlike the kind and giving Altana, Promathia is known as the Lord of Chaos. It is said that his curse, unleashed on mankind for the sin of opening the Gates of Paradise, dooms us to an eternity of strife.
10054 : The only way for us to be saved from this horrendous curse is to forget it, and that is why the name Promathia cannot be seen nor heard anywhere across Vana'diel.
10055 : The Lord of Chaos...
10056 : This is one of the reasons why your people in the East know nothing of Promathia. Without a name, how can anything exist?
10057 : Your people are probably better off not knowing the tainted history this world has locked up in its past.
10058 : Truths we must not know. Truths we should not know. And truths we are forced to face...
10059 : We must be careful with these truths, for if we are not, they could bring tragedy.
10060 : Tragedy?
10061 : For example, Bahamut's warning. We knew all along that Bahamut would one day appear and attempt to destroy us...
10062 : You knew...!
10063 : That is why the moment we heard his voice, we mobilized our armies to capture him before he could assemble his minions. However...
10064 : Your imprudent meddling has interfered with our plans and prevented us from accomplishing our mission! Do you truly wish to see the bodies of your fallen brothers lie sprawled across the barren plains of a dead world?
10065 : Nag'molada! Ulmia was only attempting to stop Prishe from doing something...unforgivable.
10066 : This traveler, Tenzen, is the true culprit. It was he who tricked my granddaughter into taking up this ridiculous journey.
10067 : It is true; it was I who requested that Ulmia act.
10068 : However, I had received permission from the duke vicarious, Esha'ntarl, to investigate the Emptiness!
10069 : Tenzen. Stopping the Emptiness from spreading--is this not the wish of both our peoples?
10070 : Seeking out Bahamut on your own, without any set reason, ultimately disrupting our plans... Why, this sounds like nothing more than treason!
10071 : I... There is nothing more I can say. My actions were uncalled for. I apologize...
10072 : Fine. However, from now on I request that you leave all matters dealing with the Wyrmking to the Duchy.
10073 : Differences in thinking can cause different reactions from different races. However, we in Jeuno care naught of differences. Our wish is only to save all the children of Vana'diel.
10074 : And that is why you have begun new plans to stop Bahamut...? But he has left Riverne. How will you find him?
10075 : Everything is in motion. However, as for the details, I, myself, know little.
10076 : My assignment has nothing to do with Bahamut. My mission is to stop that boy.
10077 : Hm...? %, where is your amulet?
10078 : I... I sold it. It was stolen. I gave it to Prishe.
10079 : %! I apologize. The amulet... % gave it away.
10080 : What!? Gave it away!? You imbecile! How could you just let go of such an important item!?
10081 : Sir, it is not %'s fault.
10082 : I asked [him/her] to give it to Prishe to help her. I wanted to save her...
10083 : Prishe?
10084 : Ah... I see. If the amulet is still here, then...
10085 : %. Retrieve the amulet from the girl and bring it to the resting place of the fourth crystal in the Northlands.
10086 : The crystal is located deep below Castle Zvahl, and it can only be reached by traversing the ruins of Pso'Xja.
10087 : Hear ye, Hear ye!
10088 : The soldiers have left the Sacrarium! They're headin' up and movin' out!
10089 : They've finished packing their secret boxes! They've got what they want and now they're gone!
10090 : Hm? Secret boxes...?
10091 : %. Come to the far western entrance of Pso'Xja, but not without the amulet. I will be waiting for you there.
10092 : Lord Bahamut. So, he has appeared to wreak devastation on the people of Vana'diel...
10093 : And his minions have been called to his side in preparation for this genocide.
10094 : But we cannot fight against so many dragons. All we can do is sit back and watch helplessly as events unfold.
10095 : If the will of Promathia is mixed up in this, we may not have any choice in the matter in any case. Will Prishe be able to find some way to avert this catastrophe?
10096 : Prishe!
10097 : Oh, hey, everybody!
10098 : Thanks for coming to visit. I've been so bored here, all alone in my room.
10099 : I am relieved to see that you are feeling better, Lady Prishe.
10100 : Please, let me apologize for my actions on Cape Riverne.
10101 : I did not realize that after returning to Tavnazia you would meet such a fate.
10102 : You didn't realize? Does it look like I had any idea either?
10103 : I was just trying to protect our criminal buddy, %. Who would have thought I'd be the one who got caught?
10104 : Oh well. I'm sorry that I got you guys all worried over me.
10105 : As everybody already knows, I'm often referred to as the abhorrent one. That's why I was locked up in the cathedral for a while there.
10106 : When Miss Mildaurion became boss, she would often let me out of the church so I could roam around the town freely. It was pretty fun...
10107 : During the Great War, I was able to help a lot of people, and before long everyone had started to forget why they feared me.
10108 : But now look! They're never going to let me out of here again! Damn!
10109 : Prishe! You are not the abhorrent one! There is nothing abhorrent about you!
10110 : Yes, you were changed by that accident long ago, but you are still Prishe!
10111 : Changed? Do you mean that without that amulet, you...
10112 : I heard from the elder Despachiaire that Lady Prishe was troubled by a grave sickness, but...
10113 : That... That is...
10114 : Come on, topknot boy. Don't you get it? %, you understand what's going on, right?
10115 : Do you understand? Yes. No.
10116 : That's right. Take a look at me. I haven't aged a day since that accident!
10117 : Huh? Have you been paying attention at all the past few days?
10118 : Look at me. I haven't aged a single day since my accident.
10119 : That... That cannot be possible!
10120 : The real reason I was locked up in the cathedral for so long was because I got too close to a certain object hidden deep below the church...
10121 : I was about to touch it, and BOOM! There was this bright light, and I was left like this.
10122 : If I were a Tarutaru, no one would have ever noticed, but I'm Elvaan. After a couple of years, people started to wonder why I wasn't getting any bigger.
10123 : Amazing... I would have never imagined...
10124 : But is that truly a reason for everyone to call you the abhorrent one?
10125 : There must be... Could it be that not only are you incapable of aging, but you cannot...
10126 : Die? Hell if I know. And I'm not throwing myself off any cliffs to find out.
10127 : But you know, since the accident, no monster has come near me. I guess you could say that's pretty close to immortality.
10128 : For centuries, the emperors of my nation have searched for the secrets of eternal life.
10129 : Never did I think I would be standing before that secret... I can understand why Despachiaire would want to hide you from the others by branding you with the title of abhorrent.
10130 : ...To protect you from the teasing and the taunting of your peers, but more so from those who would use you for their own personal gain. People like the emperors of countries such as mine...
10131 : ...
10132 : Whoa, wait a minute! How do we know that you really came here to see Bahamut?
10133 : You'd better not be thinking of auctioning me off to your leaders, 'cause I'm not for sale!
10134 : Of course I would never do such a thing, Lady Prishe! My mission was to speak with Lord Bahamut. However, I did not know that things would turn out as they did...
10135 : What!? You've already met Bahamut!?
10136 : Unbelievable! Why the hell didn't anybody tell me what was going on? Tenzen! If you want to apologize for something, start by apologizing for not taking me with you guys!
10137 : While I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs, the whole world's turning upside down, and you're the ones having all the fun!
10138 : Well, now it's time for Prishe to get a piece of the action. I'll find that overgrown steam lizard and give him a piece of my mind!
10139 : I am sorry, Prishe, but that will not be possible.
10140 : % and Sir Tenzen must return to the Northlands.
10141 : And they will need the amulet you are currently borrowing...
10142 : Lady Prishe, will you accompany us to the Northlands, if only for a short period of time?
10143 : If we receive permission from Nag'molada, I am positive that elder Despachiaire will allow Prishe to leave this place.
10144 : Fine by me... But why do we have to go back to the Northlands? That place is freezing!
10145 : To meet the boy...
10146 : Diabolos and Bahamut may have refused to help us, but we cannot sit back and allow the Emptiness to take over Vana'diel.
10147 : We must find that boy and learn the truth that lies within the will of Promathia!
10148 : The will of Promathia?
10149 : Do you not remember when the ruler of dreams told us that the Emptiness was the will of the Twilight God?
10150 : This terrible deity is said to have cast a hideous curse on the children of the Dawn.
10151 : His will can be nothing but pure evil!
10152 : And it is that will that calls the Keeper of the Apocalypse...
10153 : The will of Promathia calls the keeper...?
10154 : Excuse me milady, but elder Despachiaire has requested that you not bother Lady Prishe any longer.
10155 : (So, what you really want is to ask this boy about what Promathia's thinking, right?)
10156 : (Well, put simply...yes.)
10157 : (Well, instead of wasting your time chasing after some crazy boy, why don't we go and ask Promathia ourselves?)
10158 : (I know where we can find him.)
10159 : Wh-wh-wh-what!?
10160 : (Heh heh. On the Misareaux Coast, there's a cave leading to the Sacrarium. Head there and you'll see what I'm talking about. But don't forget your preparations before you go...unless you really want to meet Promathia--just not in this world!)
10161 : I'm sorry, I can't let you see Prishe. It's unfortunate, but that's the way it is.
10162 : I haven't told anyone else yet, but they're saying that Prishe is the child of the Twilight God.
10163 : It's true, I'm telling you! That's because I also overheard that Promathia is residing in the deepest corner of the Sacrarium!
10164 : She spoke with the abhorrent god of chaos! What more evidence do we need!?
10165 : It all makes sense now. Why else would Bahamut choose Tavnazia as his place of return!? It is all because of this girl!
10166 : She is the origin of all our troubles! Perhaps it is even her fault that the beastmen first converged on Tavnazia twenty years ago!
10167 : Granpere! It is unfair to blame Prishe for all of Tavnazia's misfortunes!
10168 : It is because Prishe's heart is pure--that is why she was not controlled by the evil after touching the statue of Promathia...
10169 : She only did such a foolish thing to save our nation! Why can't you understand this!?
10170 : Save our nation? How am I to believe this after what I have seen?
10171 : If the Marquisate remained, the cathedral theologians would have discovered the true reason behind this child's existence and the terrible things she is planning.
10172 : Ah, forgive me, Altana. I should have revealed everything to Nag'molada. It was my mistake to conceal what I knew to protect our city's image.
10173 : He could have possibly led us to the truth about the true intentions of the abhorrent one...
10174 : Granpere! Have you forgotten what Cardinal Mildaurion told us?
10175 : She told us Prishe may have been born the abhorrent one, but she was reborn through the power of Altana.
10176 : And perhaps we should question the loyalty of Mildaurion C Giloumet as well? What were her true intentions?
10177 : I have recently heard rumors that the San d'Orian Cathedral is attempting to capture her!
10178 : Who could have told you such things...!?
10179 : Who the hell are you!?
10180 : Let me introduce myself. My name is Louverance N Mistalle. I have been listening to your exchange for the past few moments.
10181 : This knight has been dispatched by order of the San d'Orian Cathedral to search out the missing Cardinal Mildaurion. He arrived here via a Duchy airship.
10182 : Louverance... I recall hearing that name once before...when I visited San d'Oria...
10183 : Ah, you must be the one who visited Madame Hinaree. So you are already aware of the details of my mission.
10184 : At the close of the Great War over twenty years ago, the cathedral reliquary was robbed. Mildaurion C Giloumet is believed to have been involved in the theft of a large number of scrolls and scriptures.
10185 : It is said that this loss ultimately drove the reigning papsque, Muchavatte P Couchiret, to his death. This is why the San d'Orian Cathedral is adamant in locating the cardinal.
10186 : Miss Mildaurion! You've got to be kidding!?
10187 : I know neither of her guilt nor innocence, and that is why I have been searching for anyone who remembers her. It looks as if I finally found someone who can give me some useful information.
10188 : Let me take the girl. I can see that her presence has been quite the burden on you and your people.
10189 : Well... If this is what the cathedral desires, I am not one to stand in its way...
10190 : Granpere!
10191 : Ulmia, don't worry. I was beginning to think that it's about time everybody learned the truth.
10192 : I've gotta do something, or people will continue to doubt and hate me.
10193 : Prishe... But...!
10194 : Hey, Louverance! As much as I'd like to take up your offer of a free cruise to the Kingdom, I'm gonna have to pass. I gotta go to the Northlands with these guys before I can do anything else.
10195 : Like they say, a promise is a promise.
10196 : Yes! We must hurry to the Northlands to assist the Jeunoan diplomat, Nag'molada.
10197 : The future of Vana'diel rides on this crucial mission. I understand your orders, Sir Louverance, but there are more important issues we must first address.
10198 : You are working with Nag'molada...? I see...
10199 : I offer you this suggestion...
10200 : Come to my airship and tell me what you know of Cardinal Mildaurion.
10201 : When you have answered all my questions, I shall personally fly you to the Northlands.
10202 : Can I assume that I, too, am welcome aboard your ship?
10203 : As a messenger from the Eastern dynasty, I request an audience with the royaulis.
10204 : Understood. I will be waiting at the Sealion's Den.
10205 : Lady Prishe, I am pleased to find out that you are a woman of understanding. Now make your goodbyes and hurry to the docks.
10206 : I was relieved to hear that Sir Louverance would be taking Prishe into his custody.
10207 : She will be better off with the San d'Orian Cathedral seeing to her needs.
10208 : However, I never imagined that Cardinal Mildaurion was capable of committing crimes against the Kingdom.
10209 : To think that such a noble woman could resort to criminal activity... The heart is a mysterious thing. It can often change without even a hint of notice.
10210 : So Ulmia truly left with Prishe...
10211 : Perhaps there was nothing that an old man such as myself could have done to prevent it...
10212 : I will not allow you to go tagging along with the abhorrent one! I will not allow it!
10213 : Granpere, you know as well as I do...
10214 : There is nothing abhorrent about Prishe...
10215 : And I can no longer ignore the problems that loom before us. Goodbye, Granpere.
10216 : Ulmia!
10217 : I did everything I could to provide for my friends and family in this cursed place...
10218 : I never realized that my actions were only tying them down...
10219 : %... Is Ulmia... How is she doing?
10220 : Greetings, Despachiaire. It has been too long.
10221 : Sir Louverance!
10222 : You need not worry. She is fine. % and I travel the world in search of a truth--a single truth that will restore light to Vana'diel and her children.
10223 : Your granddaughter embraces the same goal as we do, and she will not give up until she has reached it.
10224 : I can sleep easier knowing that such a noble knight as yourself is watching over my dear Ulmia. However, she is often one to hide her true feelings away from others, even though she may be in pain.
10225 : You... You are not causing her any pain, are you?
10226 : Ulmia is a very strong-willed young woman. She understands the responsibilities that lie before her and will not cower before them.
10227 : That is why she blamed herself for not knowing more about the painting of Al'Taieu kept in the Tavnazian Cathedral's reliquiarium.
10228 : Wh-what!?
10229 : Lady Ulmia is not a theologian of the cathedral. No one expects her to know of the painting. However...
10230 : Exactly! There is no way she could know of the painting. She was only a mere child when the piece was donated to the cathedral. Oh, why must you blame yourself, poor Ulmia?
10231 : Sir Louverance! I know some of the history behind the painting. Let me tell you of what I know.
10232 : Long ago, I helped in the transport of the relic to the cathedral. Much tumult arose as a result of bringing that painting here.
10233 : Your assistance is greatly appreciated, Despachiaire. I will relay everything you tell me to your granddaughter.
10234 : Yes... It was some twenty-five years ago that the painting was brought to the archipelago.
10235 : According to the Marquisate officials, the painting was found deep within ancient ruins known as the Temple of Uggalepih.
10236 : It is said that the painting depicts a scene in the verse of a legendary song--the ancients and their attempt to open the Gates of Paradise...
10237 : Yes, I remember it like it was yesterday... A gate of light hovering over a grand city... The gatekeeper roaring to the heavens...
10238 : The gatekeeper took the shape of a mighty dragon. However, his four legs were bound by mighty shackles.
10239 : This image was the strongest in the painting. Many of the missionaries that came to view the painting would often call it the relic of chains, or the relic of the dragon.
10240 : I see... So at that time the identity of the city was still unknown...
10241 : Yes, until Cardinal Mildaurion viewed the painting. It was she who told us the city was Al'Taieu.
10242 : As punishment for defying the gods, the city of Al'Taieu was destroyed and banished to the bottom of the northern sea. After the cardinal revealed the truth of the painting, many a canticle was sung of this legend. There wasn't a soul in Tavnazia who had not heard one while sipping down a glass of brew in the local pub.
10243 : However... Why did the cardinal know of the city and its legend?
10244 : Though I may be mistaken, I seem to recall that before arriving in Tavnazia, Mildaurion was a priest who wandered the Outlands on a quest for spiritual enlightenment.
10245 : I have also heard tales that many of the holy relics that reached the archipelago were brought from the Outlands by thieves and pirates. Perhaps the cardinal obtained her knowledge of Al'Taieu in these forsaken areas.
10246 : The Outlands... I see...
10247 : Yes, I also remember how a group of Mithra came from those Outlands, demanding that we return the painting to the temple.
10248 : I, too, have heard that tale. After a long series of talks, the cardinal was able to convince the Mithra to allow the painting to remain in Tavnazia, without defacing the honor of the cathedral.
10249 : We were relieved, and with those Mithra beasts gone, we could go back to our normal, everyday lives.
10250 : Mithra... Perhaps they know more of the painting...
10251 : Despachiaire, would you happen to recall the names of the Mithra or where exactly they came from?
10252 : I do not remember their names. I do not think they were ever referred to by anything other than the title of sin hunters.
10253 : Sin hunters. Assassins sent from the Mithran homeland to do the dirty work of the Grand Chieftainness...
10254 : So this painting must be of great importance to their race...
10255 : Sir Louverance. A young Mithran sin hunter visited the safehold a number of days ago.
10256 : If you can find her, she may be able to better inform you of the secrets behind the painting.
10257 : A sin hunter...was here!?
10258 : Excellent... Despachiaire, I thank you very much for your assistance. I will heed your advice and begin a search for this Mithra.
10259 : A sin hunter in Tavnazia... A quite unexpected turn of events, wouldn't you say, %?
10260 : Let us travel to Windurst and inquire with the chieftainness about the sin hunters and the painting they desire.
10261 : A young Mithran sin hunter visited the safehold a number of days ago. She said she was searching for Prishe.
10262 : If you can find her, perhaps she may be able to better inform you of the secrets behind the painting.
10263 : As you know, a young Mithran sin hunter visited the safehold a number of days ago.
10264 : I cannot imagine for what reasons she visited us. However, if you can find her, she may be able to better inform you of the secrets behind the painting.
10265 : You can't fish here.
10266 : You can't fish without a rod in your hands.
10267 : You can't fish without bait on the hook.

10369 : By the way, did you figure out what happened?
10370 : Tenzen's sword saved our butts.
10371 : He released all the power of Phoenix and it shielded us from Bahamut's megaflare.
10372 : This should keep his dragon-ness quiet for a while. I guess this puts us at a...whatchamacallit...a deadlock.

10375 : If it means I get to save the world and everything, I'm not that afraid to die, you know?
10376 : But it looks like that won't be happening.
10377 : There is a way to save Vana'diel without me kicking the bucket. Nothing simple, but there is a way.
10378 : There's always been someone in every age who never gave up, always found a way...
10379 : I mean, even living with Promathia's curse, people have survived.
10380 : That's why I want you to keep on fighting. Keep on living.
10381 : I kinda like having you around.
10382 : Heh heh heh! Enough of this sappy talk!

10384 : Next stop: the celestial capital of Al'Taieu! There's another Keeper of the Apocalypse that needs a taste of Knuckle Sandwich a la Prishe!
10385 : Everyone's here in Tavnazia. Round 'em up and move 'em out to the port.
10386 : %! I'm sorry to have kept you waiting!
10387 : After all the excitement, I lost consciousness. I am afraid I have little idea of what went on.
10388 : But my ears still ring from that terrible battle cry, and my soul cringes from that heart-rending whisper...
10389 : That was the last we will ever hear from the great Phoenix.
10390 : While the other terrestrial avatars were forever flitting beyond our reach, the fiery Phoenix was always by our side.
10391 : Along with Tenzen, she gave us her strength and courage... She guided us along our path...
10392 : Is Tenzen all right? He laughed it off as an inevitable occurrence, but I am terribly worried for him.
10393 : I'm a bit worried about the samurai guy myself. He's closed himself off to everyone. Who knows what he's really thinking?
10394 : Those warrior types are good at hiding their true feelings. I hope it's nothing serious.
10395 : %, please see if you can reach through the barrier that Tenzen has built against us.
10396 : You're our best shot, %. Looks like Tenzen has skipped out of Tavnazia, and I don't like this little chill that's running up my spine.
10397 : Prishe and Ulmia are inside. By the sound of it, they had a tough time on their trip to the clouds.
10398 : I know I said some pretty harsh things about Prishe before, but after hearing about how she stood up to that beast...
10399 : She has more guts than the rest of the Tavnazian Patrol put together! (Just don't let Justinius know I said that.)
10400 : ...!
10401 : [Sir/Lady] %, I'm glad to see you in good health.
10402 : Your words landed us in a serious predicament, but at least we have made a safe return.
10403 : However, if I were in Bahamut's skin, I would be most unwilling to forgive our recent actions.
10404 : It would be in the best interests of the residents here if we were to leave as soon as possible.
10405 : Speaking of which, have you seen our good friend Tenzen?
10406 : Rumors have reached me that he has left the safehold alone, unable to bear the loss of the power in his blade.
10407 : I am unclear on the properties of the weapon, but I am sure it is considered a national treasure in the Far East.
10408 : Tenzen saved our lives with that sacrifice...
10409 : We have already expressed our gratitude, but I believe you have yet to speak with him since the incident.
10410 : Without an airship, we cannot leave this island.
10411 : If Tenzen is nowhere to be found in the town, perhaps he set out for the Misareaux Coast?
10412 : For the first time in my life, I prayed to Altana--I prayed for your safe return. And look... All of you managed to escape that terror in the skies.
10413 : Perhaps Altana truly does exist... I wonder if it is not too late to start believing?
10414 : Hail the proud and valiant knights of Tavnazia! Raise the pennants and cheer us on to victory!
10415 : I am Quelveuiat of the Tavnazian Temple Knights! And who might you be, [sir/madame]!?
10416 : Do you seek to join our illustrious order?
10417 : Do you wish to join the Temple Knights? I do! Not particularly...
10418 : Oho! A fine and spirited reply, my friend!
10419 : Such a lackluster response! A weak spirit promotes a weak body!
10420 : Begone!!!
10421 : However, the Temple Knights are not currently in need of recruits.
10422 : Mayhap you would prefer enlisting in the Tavnazian Royal Knights? What say you!?
10423 : Would you prefer the Royal Knights? I would! Not particularly...
10424 : Excellent! Your initiation into the order will require the performance of a duty.
10425 : This duty will test your physical fitness as well as your mental fortitude!
10426 : Go to the lookout platform in the south of Lufaise Meadows and assess the situation out there. You have your orders, squire!
10427 : You have completed your watch duty? Oh, I say!
10428 : Orcish blood... It appears you have passed your initiation with flying colors! A splendid display!
10429 : I present you with this gift to celebrate the birth of a new Tavnazian knight!
10430 : Congratulations! I expect great things from you, %!
10431 : We must constantly temper our minds and bodies in preparation for beastmen attacks!
10432 : A knight must think beyond mere survival. You must be willing to sacrifice your very life to achieve victory!
10433 : %, would I be correct in assuming that you have encountered the fearsome Mithran sin hunters in your adventures?
10434 : %, are you familiar with the Mithran sin hunters I was previously discussing with Sir Louverance?
10435 : Have you heard of the sin hunters? Yes, we've crossed paths before. Can't say that I have...
10436 : The sin hunters are responsible for punishing those who have broken Mithran law.
10437 : However, their hunts are not restricted to the Mithra alone. In some circumstances, we Elvaan also become targets of their pursuit...
10438 : A short while ago, a sin hunter arrived in the safehold. She appears to be in search of Cardinal Mildaurion...
10439 : I explained to her that the cardinal's whereabouts have been unknown to us since our isolation following the Great War.
10440 : Apparently the sin hunter had learned about Prishe from her conversations with others in the safehold, and insisted on meeting with her.
10441 : But after discovering that Prishe was not presently in Tavnazia, she demanded to see Prishe's room, instead.
10442 : Whatever could she have been searching for in Prishe's quarters?
10443 : I do hope this matter will not bring misfortune upon our already beleaguered community...
10444 : The Mithran sin hunter?
10445 : Keep your voice down! You wish to know of the Mithra who demanded to see Prishe's room, right?
10446 : [It's the first time I've seen one/I'm not talking about you, of course], but Mithra seem to be a menacing race.
10447 : When I tried arguing with that sin hunter, I was told off most sternly by old Odeya.
10448 : I snuck a quick look into the room after the Mithra had left, but nothing appeared out of place.
10449 : But if you talk to Odeya, she might have something interesting to tell you. The Mithra went to talk to her after searching Prishe's room.
10450 : I haven't said anything about this to Prishe or the others yet. I should probably make a report...
10451 : That Mithra is some kind of tracker called a sin hunter. That's what old Odeya told me.
10452 : The sin hunter went to talk to her after searching Prishe's room.
10453 : Don't be drinking the water here, young'un. This here's where I do my laundry.
10454 : Speak up, [son/lass]. Ye say ye want to hear about that sin hunter?
10455 : Oh, don't be asking old Odeya such frightful questions. If I say anything she don't take a liking to, that Mithra'll eat me right up.
10456 : Speaking of eating, it's the season for %. Can't say as I've had the chance to sample any this year.
10457 : Be nice if some young'un was to bring me some tasty %.
10458 : Not a lot, now, is there? Not even enough for sharing with a nice [lad/lass] like ye.
10459 : Even in times like this, though, Granpa Hyogo would go without a full belly so's Prishe wouldn't go hungry.
10460 : That child's mother had such a lovely voice. It's the priests' fault she died the way she did. Poor little thing.
10461 : After old Hyogo died, Prishe started living in the cathedral.
10462 : When I told this tale to the Mithra, she went straight off to see the cathedral for herself.
10463 : My eyes aren't as sharp as they used to be, but it looked like she found a key to some part of the cathedral in Prishe's room.
10464 : My eyes aren't as sharp as they used to be, but it looked like she found a key to some part of the cathedral in Prishe's room.
10465 : Justinius don't hand over the key to the Misareaux Coast gate without good reason.
10466 : Seems that Mithra'll be getting to the cathedral through the aqueducts.
10467 : So, did ye meet up with the sin hunter?
10468 : I brrrought this for you, Odeya.
10469 : That flower...
10470 : Yep, it's the one your little sister used to like.
10471 : I'll place it in frrront of the Tavnazian castle gate, just like I promised.
10472 : It will lie on the spot where your sister lost her life. I'm sure her spirrrit will find peace in its beauty.
10473 : I'm very grateful, but...
10474 : I can't ask ye to do that. Tavnazia has become a place of nightmare.
10475 : I know ye're a big girl and all, but no one could make it out there alive. Don't throw ye life away for me.
10476 : Ahahaha. Are you worried about little ol' me? I'm a sin hunterrr. We don't die that easily.
10477 : And I'm not doing this out of the kindness of my heart. I want you to tell me about the secrrret room in the Tavnazian Cathedral.
10478 : Frrrom what I could tell, some kind of sword was kept in there.
10479 : I want you to scour your memory for every little scrap you can rrremember about that sword and what it meant to Tavnazia.
10480 : I was but a simple maid, so's there's not much I can tell ye...
10481 : All I know is that if ye're speaking of a secret sword in the cathedral, ye must be speaking of Lightbringer.
10482 : Lightbringer?
10483 : San d'Oria put this weapon in the safekeeping of the Tavnazian Cathedral many years ago.
10484 : The stories say that it was the blade of King Ranperre, and was powerful enough to break the legs of a black dragon.
10485 : A black drrragon...? That's a wyrm you're talking about! The one found in King Ranperre's tomb!
10486 : That's the weapon for me! With a sword like that, I could be rrright on the frontlines with my sister, slaying wyrms!
10487 : I need to know more about this legend. Is there anyone arrround who has the full story?
10488 : Let's see now. If she's alive, Cardinal Mildaurion would be the one to talk to, of course...
10489 : But since she's nowhere to be found, ye might try chatting with the red mage, Rainemard. He's the one who told me the tale in the first place.
10490 : Rainemard? I don't rrremember meeting anyone in Tavnazia with a name like that...
10491 : Heh heh, so's ye've met everyone, have ye? Well, Rainemard returned to the Kingdom of San d'Oria more than twenty years ago, before the Great War.
10492 : He was a real pious man, that Rainemard. If he's still alive, ye'll probably find him kneeling in the San d'Orian Cathedral.
10493 : The San d'Orian Cathedral, rrright?  Thanks, Odeya.
10494 : And thank you for your cooperation, %. Herrre, you can have this. It might come in handy.
10495 : Bye, Odeya. This flower'll be put in frrront of the Tavnazian Castle, I swear by the tip of my tail!
10496 : Don't ye go getting yeself killed, ye hear!
10497 : I told you not to worry. I'm a Mithran sin hunterrr. We're the ones that do the killing!
10498 : Don't ye worry, I'll be letting Despachiaire know about everything that happened here.
10499 : That sin hunter was still a young'un, I'd say. She's still too sweet to people of other races to have been hunting for long.
10500 : <Sigh>
10501 : !!!
10502 : Why, I don't believe we've met. From where have you come, noble adventurer?
10503 : I see... The light of the Dawn Goddess has blessed you on your journey.
10504 : Ah, I apologize. Let me introduce myself. My name is Frescheque. I made my living crafting accessories for the townsfolk.
10505 : But now... Now I am useless to Tavnazia...
10506 : When my homeland was destroyed during the Great War, I realized my life was over. Yes, I have my new home here in the safehold, but not a day goes by that I do not wish I could return to the days of past.
10507 : I understand that I will never be able to go back, but there is a part of me that doesn't want to believe...
10508 : Did you know I have a daughter? She would always pester me to take her out to Blueblade Fell to pick marguerites.
10509 : I could never say no. You should have seen the smile on her face when she was gathering flowers. It was the most beautiful...
10510 : Until one day she was taken... Not three yalms from where I rest in the shade, a terrible beast appeared out of nowhere, lifted her up, and carried her off into the nearby forest. A search party was formed, but she was never found...
10511 : It has been almost five years since I last saw her, but there are still no signs of whether or not she survived... I would go out and search for her myself, but I am untrained in the ways of battle.
10512 : If I were only as skilled as my wife...
10513 : !!!
10514 : Frescheque! What are you doing over here!?
10515 : And who is this ruffian you are associating with?
10516 : [He/She]'s an adventurer from the mainland, my dear.
10517 : Let me introduce you. This is my wife, Raminey.
10518 : Hmph!
10519 : Ah!
10520 : Only a well-trained traveler could have made it to this island.
10521 : What do you think, my love? Perhaps we could ask [him/her] to search for some clues of our daughter's whereabouts? [He/She] is certain to succeed where we have failed!
10522 : Succeed where we have failed? Don't tell me you're planning another half-brained scheme. Do you even understand the situation our city's in? The elders will not tolerate any more foolishness!
10523 : But, my darling. It may be our last chance to...
10524 : Don't you but darling me. It's your irrational behavior that caused all this in the first place!
10525 : I know. But we can't just give up... Think of our daughter.
10526 : Think of our daughter?
10527 : Let me ask you this: Were you thinking of our daughter when you took her to Blueblade Fell to get kidnapped!?
10528 : ...
10529 : ... Enough of this. I don't have time to chat with strangers.
10530 : And Frescheque! If you really want to help, you'll get back to your work. It's hard enough trying to make ends meet without you wasting the day away fraternizing with vagrants.
10531 : She's right, you know... It is my fault that our daughter is gone...
10532 : And that is why it is my responsibility to find some remnant of her. Please, I beg of you. Help me.
10533 : My daughter... She always wore a tiny bracelet with white flowers carved around its surface. My wife wears one exactly like it, only larger, of course.
10534 : I apologize that there is not more to go on, but I am counting on you, [sir/ma'am].
10535 : Oh, and I must ask that you don't speak of our conversation with my wife. It would only complicate things...
10536 : Oh, it's you again. What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy here?
10537 : If you want an apology for what I said back there, well, you're not going to get one. My family's business is my family's business, and I don't need any outsiders sticking their noses into it.
10538 : What, you came to inquire about my wristlet?
10539 : My husband made it. He was quite a fine craftsman...until we lost our daughter.
10540 : Now he just wanders about the safehold, his head hung low...dreaming of a past that will never return.
10541 : The engraving here?
10542 : Why, it could be any kind of flower. For all I know, it's something my crazy husband simply made up.
10543 : And it won't... It won't help bring my daughter back...
10544 : So I see you've met with Frescheque and Raminey...
10545 : Lately those two have not been on the best of terms. I worry about them almost every day...
10546 : Everyone talks about how sad Frescheque looks all the time, but he is not the only one who is in pain. I've seen Raminey stare at that bracelet of hers for hours on end...
10547 : But she's simply too proud to show her true feelings.
10548 : Poor, poor girl... Did you know that the search parties used that wristlet to try and locate Frescheque and Raminey's daughter?
10549 : They thought if they could find the same flowers engraved on the bracelet, they might be able to find Shemmie... They never did, though...
10550 : I wonder if it is about time we finally give up hope...
10551 : So... So she's...
10552 : ... Gone...
10553 : ...
10554 : .........
10555 : Do... Have you ever come across this flower in your travels? Not many people have seen one, but they do exist...
10556 : That day, five years ago, little Shemmie came to me in my workshop after being scolded by her mother...
10557 : Papa...
10558 : ...?
10559 : Papa!
10560 : !!!
10561 : What's wrong, Shemmie?
10562 : Mama got angry with me for dropping her teacup...
10563 : Oh, you need not worry. Mama may be angry now, but she'll forgive you. She always does, doesn't she?
10564 : Here, I have a surprise for you.
10565 : A surprise?
10566 : What do you think?
10567 : Papa! Did you make it?
10568 : Just for you.
10569 : It's so beautiful!
10570 : Can I really have it...?
10571 : Of course. Now you have a wristlet just like your mother's.
10572 : Oh, thank you, Papa! What is this flower called?
10573 : I forgot the name. My father--your grandfather--showed one to me when I was just about your age.
10574 : He said that they used to grow all about the meadows...
10575 : Really!? I'd love to see a real one! Papa, can we go look for one sometime?
10576 : I'll never forget the smile on her face... The sparkle in her eyes...
10577 : Now, perhaps...she can rest in peace...
10578 : Please, take this as a token of my gratitude. I'm truly sorry that I don't have anything more to reward you for your kindness.
10579 : This tool was passed down to me from my master goldsmith. It may be of some use to you in the future.
10580 : Why, you're the adventurer that came by the other day asking about Frescheque and Raminey.
10581 : I heard that you found Shemmie's wristlet. Legend has it that the flower engraved on that accessory withers and dies when tragedy befalls its bearer.
10582 : Maybe that is why Raminey tried to forget what happened to her daughter...
10583 : Young adventurer. I come to this place often to gaze up at the sky...
10584 : However, sometimes it's not what's happening in the heavens that catches my eye.
10585 : I couldn't hear their voices...
10586 : ...but I could see the looks on their faces. I know all they have gone through...
10587 : ...and that is why it pains me to see them act that way.
10588 : ...and it pains me to always see Frescheque sad and alone.
10589 : ... However, they must realize that no matter what we may lose on our journey down the path of life...
10590 : ...we must continue on.
10591 : Twenty years ago, the people of this town lost much, but they have put all that behind them.
10592 : It is the pain of losing something in the past that makes us realize the importance of what we have now...
10593 : You finding that flower... Perhaps it was Shemmie trying to tell us something--tell her troubled parents something...
10594 : Hopefully your good deed will help bring the two back together so they can continue their journey...hand in hand...
10595 : As long as we are bound by the past, we will never be able to step forward into the future. That is what I used to believe. However, now I realize that without the foundation the past has left us, our future will never stand.
10596 : The change the safehold has experienced recently... It has all been so sudden. However, we must learn to adapt and move on if we are to survive.
10597 : The world around us may change, but the people living in it will always stay the same...
10598 : The world around us may change, but the people living in it will always stay the same...
10599 : No matter how hard I try, my lousy husband will never be more than a weak, cowardly, whining mutt...
10600 : Hm? Oh, not another adventurer... I appreciate all the aid coming in from Jeuno, but I miss the peace and quiet of the old Tavnazia. With all the scruffy travelers constantly coming up to me asking for this and that, I can't concentrate on my daily chores!
10601 : Good day, young adventurer.
10602 : I suppose your travels have taken you to the four corners of Vana'diel--across towering mountains and vast oceans...
10603 : <Sigh> It has been so long since I have seen Tavnazia's emerald-green seas...
10604 : When I was still young, I used to take walks along the beach near the capital.
10605 : The whole world sparkled as the evening sun reflected off the waves.
10606 : As I would stare out from the white sands, I used to imagine that the water stretched on to infinity.
10607 : But all I have left now are my fading memories...
10608 : How I long to feel the cool spray on my skin; to hear the soft whisper of the waves...
10609 : However, confined to the cold, damp walls of this forsaken cavern, I fear that I may never again hear the call of the seabirds...
10610 : There are days when the southern winds carry upon their wings the salty fragrance of the ocean, as if to torment me; it is a constant reminder that what seems so close is in fact so far from reach.
10611 : However, I do recall one thing...
10612 : Long ago, an acquaintance of mine told me a tale of a shell that, when placed to one's ear, could magically transport the listener to the seashore.
10613 : He said that this treasure was guarded by a great beast that lived on the peninsula coast.
10614 : Why a monster would go to the trouble of hiding such an item was beyond me, but I did not press my friend for any further details.
10615 : He was known well for his ability to exaggerate the truth, and so at the time, I took his stories with a grain of rocksalt.
10616 : However, now that I have aged and have had time to reflect on his tall tale, there is a part of me that wishes what he said were true.
10617 : Perhaps I am simply grasping at threads of hope at a time when the winds of despair rage through the heart of an old, withered soul.
10618 : Ah, an adventurer. Free to roam where your spirit guides you. Much I envy you and your lifestyle, [sir/ma'am].
10619 : I am sure you have heard the stories of the safehold residents...
10620 : ...About the glory of the once mighty sealion...
10621 : While I am still young and inexperienced, I and my fellow companions are doing our best to maintain the safety of all those who reside in these caves.
10622 : We risk our lives to ensure that Tavnazia will carry on, no matter what obstacles may arise.
10623 : However, all we hear from the village elders is how wonderful the Tavnazia of old was--how they all wish they could return to the time before the war.
10624 : As much as I try to understand how they feel, I cannot help but be angered by their lack of appreciation for what we work so hard to bring them.
10625 : Why must they drag around the past?
10626 : What is wrong with what we have now?
10627 : I just do not understand...
10628 : If you are interested in such tales, why not try speaking with the elders of the safehold?
10629 : Why, Lady Equette is always reminiscing of times forgotten...
10630 : Hm? Where did you come from, [mister/lady]?
10631 : ... On a trip? Wait a minute, are you one of those adventurers?
10632 : Wow! A real adventurer! Hey, did you know that I'm training to be an adventurer, too?
10633 : One of these days, I'm gonna set out and find some buried treasure! And when I do, I'm gonna divide it among everybody here in the safehold so they can have better lives.
10634 : I'm ready to go right now, but my mom and dad say that I'm still too young to go outside...
10635 : I wish I was older so I could join the Tavnazian Patrol like my brother...
10636 : Sometimes he tells me stories about battles with horned beasts, green giants, and all sorts of neat-sounding monsters.
10637 : But even he won't let me go with him on scouting missions to the nearby forests or cliffs.
10638 : I haven't even seen the ocean... You've been to the ocean, haven't you? I heard it's filled with lots of mysterious treasures.
10639 : My brother also told me that monsters like to collect those treasures. When he defeats one, he says that it sometimes drops a rare item from the sea!
10640 : If I could get my hands on one of those treasures, I could help everybody out! But, I don't know if I could take out one of those monsters by myself...
10641 : What? You'll help me out!?
10642 : Wow, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer! You're the greatest!
10643 : My brother said that he once saw a beast carrying a strange spirally shell on its back. I bet we could sell that for a lot of gil!
10644 : Whoa! You found a spirally shell, just like my big brother told me about. I wonder if it makes any sound when you blow into it.
10645 : Huh. Well, that's no fun.
10646 : It's all interesting-looking, but if it doesn't make any sound, then what good is it?
10647 : Ante!
10648 : Ah!
10649 : Leporaitceau! I wasn't doing anything! I wasn't doing anything!
10650 : Ante, what did I tell you about playing with other people's belongings!
10651 : But this isn't someone else's belongings, it's this adventurer's belongings! [He/She] found it near the cliffs.
10652 : And why would a complete stranger give you, of all people, [his/her] belongings?
10653 : Why wouldn't [he/she]?
10654 : I think you've had enough fun for today, Ante. Now I'll take that shell until we can find out who this really belongs to.
10655 : Hey! You can't do that! It's not fair!
10656 : Life isn't always fair now, is it?
10657 : No! No! No! C'mon, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer, say something!
10658 : Hm? Lady Equette spoke of a shell that carried in it the sound of the sea?
10659 : Well, we cannot know if this is the shell she spoke of unless we ask her, can we?
10660 : Let us take it to her at once.
10661 : Wait! You can't go without me!
10662 : What is all the commotion?
10663 : This adventurer here found that spirally shell by the ocean!
10664 : According to [his/her] testimony, the adventurer found the shell after defeating a terrible beast on the Misareaux Coast.
10665 : ......
10666 : ......The sound...
10667 : Here, Leporaitceau. Listen to the sounds of the emerald seas.
10668 : These are the sounds I remember. These are the sounds of Tavnazia.
10669 : I... I...
10670 : ...
10671 : Mama... Mama!
10672 : When I grow up, I'm going to see what's on the other side of the ocean.
10673 : You just wait!
10674 : Mama, are you listening?
10675 : Mama! Papa! Wait for me!
10676 : ...
10677 : I...
10678 : Are you alright, son?
10679 : Yes... I--I just...
10680 : ...
10681 : Lady Equette. I would like you to have this shell.
10682 : No, I cannot accept it. I was able to hear the call of the sea once again. That is all I desired.
10683 : But Lady Equette, we insist.
10684 : I am moved by your generosity, Leporaitceau. Are you sure it would be alright?
10685 : Absolutely.
10686 : I wish I could have a neat shell like that one...
10687 : Your room is filled with conch shells that I brought back from my missions.
10688 : Yeah, but none of those sound like the ocean...
10689 : Adults have all the luck.
10690 : Yes, we do. And you'll never be one until you can respect one!
10691 : ... Alright. How about I take you out to the ocean when you turn twelve next year?
10692 : If I promise to do that, will you agree to let Lady Equette keep the shell?
10693 : ...Okay. But if you're pulling my leg, I'll...I'll...
10694 : Young Anteurephiaux, I would like to thank you. Here. Please take this as a token of my appreciation.
10695 : Huh? What's this?
10696 : It is a muffler. But not an ordinary muffler. It is said to hold the power to protect travelers on their journeys.
10697 : It was the power of this garment that led me to this safehold twenty years ago...
10698 : Whoa... Then this must be really important!
10699 : Yes. I do believe it is. Do you think you have the courage and strength to keep it safe?
10700 : Hmmm...
10701 : Actually, I think there's someone who deserves this more than I do. Here, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer, you can have it.
10702 : Ante...
10703 : Why, what a kind gesture. I am very proud of you.
10704 : You are? Heh heh. Hear that, Leporaitceau? She's proud of me! Me, not you!
10705 : When I grow up, I'm going to be a super adventurer, just like my new best friend!
10706 : Lately I spend my days reminiscing of the past... Ah, how beautiful the Marquisate was... If I could only take you there...
10707 : Recently, the light that shines down on the safehold seems brighter than it has been in ages. <Sigh> I wonder if Tavnazia will ever regain the glory of old...
10708 : There's nothing to do in this musty old cave. I wanna go outside and play in the meadows!
10709 : I've heard lots of neat stories from all the adventurers visiting the safehold. I can't wait until I'm old enough to ditch this smelly cave and go someplace exciting!
10710 : I will not rest until the Marquisate has become as grand and as powerful as it was before the Great War!
10711 : With the arrival of the airships, the situation in Tavnazia has begun to take a turn for the better.
10712 : Once again Vana'diel will hear the roar of the mighty sealion!
10713 : <Sigh> I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to catch the big one before I cross that final river to Paradise...
10714 : [Laddie/Lassie], have you ever dreamed of reeling in the impossible? Hooking the beast that legends are made of?
10715 : Fish in your eyes? All the time! I'm a vegetarian.
10716 : Vegetarian!? I don't have any business with you leaf-eaters! Move along!
10717 : Not but a few days ago, a young adventurer stopped by the safehold saying that she spotted an enormous something swimming in the waters of Lufaise Meadows. She mentioned that she tried to fish the beast up, but was unsuccessful. Just hearing that fish tale started my blood a-boiling.
10718 : I don't mean to blow my own horn, but when I was still a young 'un, there wasn't a soul in Tavnazia that didn't know the name Trawlin' Travonce. I was the finest fisherman on the whole peninsula.
10719 : And I still am, but my skills with the sword have dropped off a wee bit in these past few years.
10720 : With all the crazed beastmen roaming the islands and the savage monsters lurking below the waters, an old man can no longer just sit back and enjoy a day casting his line on the emerald waters of Tavnazia.
10721 : Now, if some nice strong young adventurer would come out with me and take care of all the pests while I fished, good ol' Trawlin' Travonce could snatch up the big one in the blink of an eye, give or take a few blinks.
10722 : Travonce looks at you with puppy-dog eyes.
10723 : <Sigh> Isn't there anyone out there...? Anyone at all...?
10724 : Will no one grant an old man his final wish before he withers away and dies...alone...and fishless?
10725 : Help him realize his dream? How could you say no? How could you say yes?
10726 : You'll help me!? What a kind young child you are! I'll go gather my equipment. You know what they say, an unprepared fisherman is a...a...
10727 : Anyway, you'd better go make your preparations as well. When you're ready, I'll be waiting at the Porte d'Altendise. What, you don't know where that is? There are four exits in the northern end of the safehold, right? Porte d'Altendise is the southeastern one.
10728 : Oh, and I like to sleep in, so don't show up until after lunchtime. But don't come too late. We have to find that fish before he swims off somewhere to sleep.
10729 : Young adventurers these days... No respect for their elders. And to top that off, they're all nothing but a lot of spineless jellyfish, to boot!
10730 : And so the big one got away again... Maybe I am getting too old for this...
10731 : Ah, that's right. I guess I should give you something in return for helping me out. How about this fishing gear? It doesn't look like an old, washed-up geezer like me will be needing it any more...
10732 : At least I had the opportunity to go out under the crisp, clean Tavnazian sky one last time before I die... <Sigh>...
10733 : The other day, a fine young [man/lady] helped me go out in search of the big one. Come to think of it, [he/she] looked an awful lot like you...
10734 : Why, you look like an energetic [lad/lass], all chock full o' pep. If I could only find myself someone like you to help an old man fulfill his final wish...
10735 : Don't tell me that you're having second thoughts. <Sigh> Maybe it's time I just went somewhere to crawl up and die...
10736 : Leave him to crawl up and die? Why not? Not just yet.
10737 : This safehold we all live in now was once part of the Tavnazian Cathedral, as were the Sealion's Den and the Sacrarium.
10738 : Aid from Jeuno has begun arriving in our city. While these items may improve our ways of life at the moment, many of us still worry about the future of the safehold.
10739 : Have you ever journeyed to the Sacrarium?
10740 : Since I was a child, it has been my dream to become an architect. I often walk alone to the Sacrarium's libraries to study the books on ancient architecture.
10741 : One day, while reading a volume on Tavnazian masonry, I discovered a tattered old set of floorplans.
10742 : However, due to its condition, there were many sections of it that were difficult to make out. If we could find another copy, I might be able to construct a new map of the Sacrarium based on the combined sets of plans.
10743 : If you happen to come across even a fragment of a document that may be of use, bring it back to me and I will do my best to piece together the puzzle.
10744 : %!
10745 : Yes, this looks similar to the set of plans I found before... But it, too, is damaged terribly. I cannot tell exactly which part of the Sacrarium it describes.
10746 : Hm? You say you found this document in a treasure chest?
10747 : Do you happen to remember in what area of the Sacrarium the chest was located?
10748 : There is a good chance that the plans describe the same area.
10749 : Where did you find the chest? Think a little longer. Around <F-5>. Around <G-5>. Around <H-5>. Around <F-11>. Around <G-11>. Around <H-11>.
10750 : Where did you find the chest? Think a little longer. Around <F-7>. Around <G-7>. Around <H-7>. Around <F-9>. Around <G-9>. Around <H-9>.
10751 : Where did you find the chest? Think a little longer. Around <I-6>. Around <J-6>. Around <K-7>. Around <K-9>. Around <I-10>. Around <J-10>.
10752 : Where did you find the chest? Think a little longer. Around <J-7>. Around <K-7>. Around <I-8>. Around <L-8>. Around <J-9>. Around <K-9>.
10753 : I see... I will use that information to attempt to reconstruct a precise map of the area. It will take me about a day to complete my work. Please come back tomorrow.
10754 : It will take me about a day to complete my work on the map of the Sacrarium. Please come back tomorrow.
10755 : I apologize. The information you provided was not precise enough for me to finish the map.
10756 : If you happen to come across any more pieces of the Sacrarium floorplans, please bring them to me. I will not give up until I've created a perfect map!
10757 : %! I succeeded in completing the %!
10758 : I never imagined that the area could be so simple, yet complicated...
10759 : This has been a wonderful experience for me. I have learned so much about the architecture of the cathedral.
10760 : Feel free to take the map with you. I have already made myself a copy. It is the least I can do.
10761 : I shall make sure to preserve it with the care due the most precious of research materials.
10762 : Would you take a look at those fuzzy guys over there? Can you believe that they'd come all the way from their cozy homes in Moogle-land to a town in the middle of nowhere? They must be really crazy or really bored.
10763 : Now that the airships from Jeuno have started arriving, there are a lot more people passing through the safehold. Those fuzzy guys over there seem pretty happy considering all the extra work.
10764 : You know about what happened to Cape Riverne, right?
10765 : Well, did you know that there's this traveling Goblin that's trying to make a new map of the area? Bet you didn't!
10766 : And I also bet you didn't know it was that Goblin who gave the areas their strange names--Site #A01 and Site #B01. Yeah, I just met the cute little girl a couple of days ago. She came to the safehold wanting to buy some supplies for her journey.
10767 : She said that she was almost done with the map, but still hadn't finished trekking through the most dangerous part of the area.
10768 : Now that I think of it, there's no way that sweet Gobmuffin can possibly make it on her own... Hey, you're a strong-looking adventurer. Would you go to Cape Riverne and see if you can find her and bring her back? It's a matter of life or death!
10769 : Would you go to Cape Riverne and see if you can find that sweet Gobmuffin and bring her back? It's a matter of life or death!
10770 : Huh!? You were attacked by what!? A strange pack of Moblins!? What's a Moblin?
10771 : Ah...
10772 : Swikastoqq is Moblinn. Swikastoqq wentt to chase away badd Moblinns.
10773 : Huh... But, what were you thinking going out there again. You could've been hurt...or even worse!
10774 : Oh, I'm sorry. Let me introduce you. This is my cutie Gobli--I mean Moblin buddy.
10775 : She came back here right after you left. She said that something happened on the cape, but I couldn't get her to tell me what it was.
10776 : I didn't want the other townspeople to worry, so I've been hiding her in this vacant storage room.
10777 : Badd Moblinns wantedd to keepp secretts of site to themselves.
10778 : Thatt's why they triedd to kill Swikastoqq!
10779 : Thiss mapp is forr everyone! Vana'diell is forr everyone!
10780 : So I give Tavnazia lady mapp.
10781 : Andd I give otherr Moblinns mapp, too. I give everyone mapp!
10782 : But are you going to be okay? What will happen if you go back to your hometown? You can always stay here with me...
10783 : Swikastoqq is Moblinn. Moblinns live undergroundd.
10784 : Swikastoqq wantedd to know more aboutt upworldd, so Swikastoqq leftt home.
10785 : Journey wass hardd. Journey wass lonely. Butt Swikastoqq hadd funn. Swikastoqq wantss to telll Moblinns aboutt funn.
10786 : I guess if that's your dream, I'm not going to stand here and hold you down. Be seeing you around, Swikastoq!
10787 : You know. I really didn't do anything at all. I don't deserve this map... Here, you take it.
10788 : You're an adventurer, right? Then maybe this map is better served in your hands? What? You've already got one? Then I'll hold onto it in case some other lost soul comes wandering by.
10789 : And if in your travels you ever see my buddy again, tell her that I said hi...and that I hope I can see her again someday...
10790 : I wonder if my little buddy's okay...
10791 : Ah, what am I worried about. She's got more brains in her pinky than I do in my pocket! She'll make it back to her hometown. I'm sure of it!
10792 : It is not only the adults of the safehold who wish to improve our current situation--many of the younger men and women are also trying to make a difference.
10793 : However, what they fail to realize is that cowering behind the walls of the city won't change anything...
10794 : My name is Ferchinne. I was tired of seeing my people suffer, so I decided to journey forth from the confines of the safehold in order to earn the title of Dragon Slayer.
10795 : I trained for many months, but I feel I still lack the skills needed to defeat a truly horrifying dragon. To be a true Dragon Slayer, one must be able to soar like a dragon, not only physically, but mentally.
10796 : Perhaps I need wings of my own to catch the winds of the endless skies...
10797 : The city elders told me that once, long ago, there were knights in the Kingdom of San d'Oria that could fly as high as the clouds.
10798 : Brave adventurer, have you ever seen a noble bird that walks on four legs? A proud beast that has the wings of an eagle?
10799 : If you come across one of these mythical creatures, I would greatly appreciate it if you removed its tailfeathers and brought them back here to me.
10800 : It is said that while those feathers are unbelievably light, they are remarkably sturdy. If I were to bond them together with wax, I could make wings of my own!
10801 : Bring back two and I will reward you with something special.
10802 : The luster, the touch... Yes, these are the feathers that I have been searching for. Thank you so very much. Now, maybe I can fly as high as the dragons themselves!
10803 : Here, take this as a token of my appreciation.
10804 : I was given that stone by an old merchant while traveling through the Eastern empire. He told me that it had the power to dissolve the clouds and rob mighty dragons of their ability to fly.
10805 : But even if it does not have that power, I'm sure you can find someone who will purchase it from you for a large sum of gil.
10806 : <Sigh> Will I ever be able to fly... Perhaps I need more feathers...
10807 : I am sorry to bother you again, but if you come across any more of the legendary tailfeathers, I beg of you to bring them to me.
10808 : Thank you, kind [sir/adventurer].
10809 : Oh, whatever am I to do...?
10810 : Excuse me, but do you think you could help me?
10811 : I was going to give an offering to the Goddess for my dear friend who passed away three years ago. However, the hairpin I was to offer is missing.
10812 : I know you must be busy with your adventuring, but if you happen to spot it, please bring the hairpin back to me. I would be extremely grateful.
10813 : Lady Elysia, what are you doing all the way down here?
10814 : P-Pradiulot!
10815 : I...uh... I was listening to the tales of this adventurer.
10816 : Hmph, tales...
10817 : [Sir/Ma'am], this may seem like an odd question, but...
10818 : We have not met before, have we?
10819 : I apologize for being so abrupt.
10820 : During the Great War twenty years ago, I suffered a terrible injury and lost all my memories of the past.
10821 : That is why every time I meet someone new, I ask them if we ever met.
10822 : Pradiulot, are you on patrol?
10823 : Hm? Ah, yes. One last circle of the area near the altar and I will be done.
10824 : Oh...
10825 : Well, as much as I would like to stay and hear the tales of your journeys, I must finish my rounds. Good day, [sir/ma'am].
10826 : Oh, and Elysia...
10827 : Might we have stew tonight? I do love your homemade stew.
10828 : Of course, Pradiulot.
10829 : ...... Ah, I'm sorry. For a moment there I was lost in thought...
10830 : Yes, the hairpin. I might have dropped it while carrying groceries from the upper level of the safehold.
10831 : I do hope you are able to find it...
10832 : I might have dropped the hairpin while carrying groceries from the upper level of the safehold. I do hope you are able to find it...
10833 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
10834 : You found it! I was beginning to think I would never see this again. Thank you so much...
10835 : Kind adventurer, do you have a moment?
10836 : I told you before that I was going to present this hairpin as an offering to the Goddess.
10837 : Twenty years ago, I lost one of my dear friends to the flames of the Great War.
10838 : No... The war did not take her life...
10839 : It was I who killed her.
10840 : Mischanau had just married, but she was very weak. While her husband, a member of the Tavnazian Knights, was on duty, I would often visit her residence and take care of her.
10841 : However, one day, the beastmen armies broke through the city's defenses and began their plundering and pillaging. I grabbed my friend's hand and began to flee with all the rest of the townspeople.
10842 : And that's when it happened...
10843 : Overcome by the crowds of people trying to escape the Orcs' arrows, I accidentally let go of Mischanau, and she was swallowed by the ocean of screaming women and children that spread in all directions.
10844 : After the battle had died down, I attempted to return to the city to find my dear friend, but I was stopped by the others.
10845 : ... I never saw Mischanau again...
10846 : Since then, not a day has gone by that I haven't seen her in my dreams...calling out my name... And that is why every year around this time I take this hairpin of hers to the Altar of the Dawn and pray... Pray that she can forgive me for the pain I caused her...
10847 : Before I go to the altar, may I ask you one more favor?
10848 : Would you find Pradiulot and tell him that I will be waiting for him by the well?
10849 : Thank you again...
10850 : Have you found Pradiulot and told him that I will be waiting for him by the well?
10851 : Ah, the adventurer from the mainland. May I help you?
10852 : Elysia is waiting for me by the well? Whatever could be wrong...?
10853 : I'm sorry that I asked you to do that.
10854 : It is just that I don't want him to see me when I make the offering for Mischanau.
10855 : I haven't been completely honest with you.
10856 : Before she died, Mischanau's husband...
10857 : ...was Pradiulot.
10858 : However, because of the injury he sustained during the war, he no longer remembers anything about her.
10859 : Mischanau was my best friend, and I was elated when I heard the news of her marriage.
10860 : Even if the groom was my childhood friend...and sweetheart... I truly did wish them eternal happiness from the bottom of my heart.
10861 : But maybe there was a part of my heart that secretly despised my friend for stealing Pradiulot away from me... And maybe that is why I let go of her twenty years ago...
10862 : I could not live with this sin bearing down upon my soul...
10863 : So, when the injured Pradiulot woke from his coma, I told him everything that happened. However, by then it was too late. He no longer remembered me--or his late wife.
10864 : I do not know what will become of Pradiulot's memory in the future, but until he has fully recovered, I have chosen to stand by his side.
10865 : This, I feel, is the only way I can pay for my terrible sins...
10866 : Thank you again for all that you have done for me. I do not know how I can repay you.
10867 : I must leave before Pradiulot returns. Please take this as a token of my gratitude.
10868 : I hope that it can aid you in your future travels.
10869 : Elysia was not at the well.
10870 : What? She came by to say that she did not need to see me at all?
10871 : Sometimes I just cannot understand that woman... If you see her again, tell her that tonight's stew had better be sublime if she wishes I forgive her!
10872 : Pradiulot was that upset? Well, I guess I had better start working on that stew!
10873 : Greetings, adventurer. Did you speak with Elysia again? Excellent. Now I have something to look forward to when I am relieved of duty.
10874 : If you do not mind me asking, what did you speak of with her?
10875 : <Sigh> Elysia is a kind, kind woman. When I was on my deathbed, she stayed by my side for three whole days and three whole nights, tending to my wounds until I recovered from my coma.
10876 : Her heart is as pure as the clear waters of Cascade Edellaine.
10877 : I have never met a woman so gentle and so sincere...
10878 : And perhaps that is her only fault...
10879 : Let me tell you a story.
10880 : Long ago, there was a boy who had a wonderful treasure so important to him that he always kept it by his side.
10881 : The treasure was so dear to him that one day, when he had to go on a long journey, he felt the only person he could trust with that treasure was his best friend.
10882 : However, while the boy was away, a terrible accident occurred and the treasure was lost forever.
10883 : When the boy returned and found what had happened to his treasure, he hated his friend for not being able to protect the item. But deep inside, the boy knew that the loss of his treasure was not only the fault of his friend.
10884 : He knew that he, too, was responsible...
10885 : However, as long as the loss of the treasure remained in the boy's heart, he knew that his friend would forever suffer with the pain of not fulfilling his promise.
10886 : The boy did not wish this of his longtime companion.
10887 : And so he chose to lose his memory.
10888 : This may sound ridiculous, but to the boy this was the only way to ease the suffering of his friend, as well as his own.
10889 : By choosing to forget about the past, it could no longer hurt him or his friend.
10890 : And so he lived in happiness, until the day he died...
10891 : Ah, I apologize for my babbling.
10892 : Farewell, traveler. I hope that you, too, can find joy in this world filled with sorrow.
10893 : You must have had a long, tiring journey. I'm sorry our town doesn't have that much to offer...
10894 : The ships from Jeuno bring in all sorts of produce and spices. My kitchen shelves will never be bare again!
10895 : All clear... Day in and day out, it is always all clear... However, I guess I cannot complain...
10896 : Lately there has been an increase in the number of outsiders utilizing our safehold's facilities. More ruffians means more crime...and that is what I am here to prevent.
10897 : I'm a traveling moogle, kupo. I help adventurers in the Outlands access items they have stored in a Mog House elsewhere, kupo.
10898 : This isn't a Mog House, so you can only use the Mog Safe, Change Jobs, and Delivery Box commands, kupo.
10899 : You have to pay fee of # gil to transfer your items to the Outlands, kupo. Why? Because the world is a cold place for rogue moogles, kupo.
10900 : Of course, you can move your items back to your Mog House in town, but if you want to transfer them to the Outlands again, you'll have to pay another fee, kupo. I've got to make a living too, kupo.
10901 : Transfer items? (Current gil:#) Pay # gil. Don't transfer items.
10902 : You don't have enough gil, kupo.
10903 : Item transfer complete, kupo.
10904 : # , #
10905 : Hello, traveler! Please have a look at these fine Tavnazian-built products!
10906 : Hidely-howdy-ho! I'll sell you what I've got if you fork over enough dough!
10907 : Do you need any Tavnazian produce? We don't have much, but find a fine cook and your problems will be solved!
10908 : Do you need any Tavnazian produce? Since the arrival of the aid from Jeuno, our inventory has almost doubled!
10909 : Welcome. I'm sorry that we don't have more to offer, but...
10910 : Welcome! Thanks to the supplies from Jeuno, I've been able to fix some of the weapons I had in storage!
10911 : Hello. As much as we'd like to sell you all the equipment we have in our warehouses, there is just not enough...
10912 : Hello! With the arrival of supplies from Jeuno, we are now able to sell some of the items we had stored in these warehouses.
10913 : Greetings, adventurer. I may have a few things that could be of interest.
10914 : Greetings, adventurer! I've been given authorization to begin the sale of the old Tavnazian armor we had in storage!
10915 : Please, [sir/ma'am]. Would you buy something from my humble shop? I have five children to feed...
10916 : Please, [sir/ma'am]. Even with the aid from Jeuno, I still have trouble feeding my six children...
10917 : The safehold warehouses used to store a great amount of equipment and supplies. However, now the rooms are almost completely bare...
10918 : I have been assigned to watch over the supplies in these storage rooms, though there is little to watch over...
10919 : If we could only make contact with the mainland... Then, maybe, the day would come when these warehouses are filled with goods from all over Vana'diel.
10920 : My job is to keep inventory of these items. However, I have to count really, really slow or I finish in ten minutes!
10921 : My legs may be short, but they're faster than lightning! I guarantee I'll get your goods to where you want them to be!
10922 : Little food... Little supplies... The one thing Tavnazia does have a lot of, though, is storage space! <Sigh>
10923 : I can send your items to anywhere in Vana'diel!
10924 : You can set this as your current home point. Once you set a home point, you will return there whenever you are incapacitated.
10925 : Set this as current home point? Yes. No.
10926 : Home point set!
10927 : A home point can be set as a spot for you to return to Vana'diel when you have been knocked out. You can also use a home point to teleport to other home points.
10928 : What will you do? Travel to another home point. Set this as your home point. Other settings. On second thought, never mind.
10929 : You have registered a new home point! You are now able to teleport here from any other home point.
10930 : You may teleport from here to any other home point you have registered.
10931 : Teleport where? Never mind. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Previous page. Next page.
10932 : Teleport where?% Nowhere. Home Point #1[/ (M)/ (A)/ (E)]. Home Point #2[/ (M)/ (A)/ (E)]. Home Point #3[/ (M)/ (A)/ (E)]. Home Point #4[/ (M)/ (A)/ (E)]. Home Point #5[/ (M)/ (A)/ (E)].
10933 : You have not yet registered any other home points, and thus are unable to teleport.
10934 : It costs # gil to teleport to Home Point ## in %.
10935 : There is no fee for teleporting to Home Point ## in %.

10946 : Do you find our enclosed city strange? That is probably because it is so different from what you have seen on the mainland.
10947 : However, for us--the forgotten--this city is all we know and all we have.
10948 : Safehold elder Despachiaire has welcomed that envoy from Jeuno with open arms. However...
10949 : I have a terrible feeling something grave is upon us. Even those three menacing Tarutaru are acting strange...
10950 : A great challenge awaits you in the skies, %.
10951 : But I cannot help but think it ironic that a forgotten city such as ours would be the site of a battle that could alter the history of all Vana'diel.
10952 : When I heard that somebody from the mainland had washed up on our island, I was expecting to see a burly pirate or a battle-scarred adventurer.
10953 : But look at you. I've seen scarier things under my bed. The world must be pretty peaceful if a pansy like you can travel about Vana'diel without getting [his/her] head lopped off with an Orcish axe.
10954 : Don't tell this to anybody, but I don't think I like that blonde robed guy with the funny apparatus over his eye.
10955 : He has all the elders wrapped around his little finger, but something tells me he's trying to pull a fast one.
10956 : If I only had proof...
10957 : If you even think of doing anything to make Prishe upset, I'll personally whack you upside the head so hard you won't remember what you had for breakfast.
10958 : Yeah, she may be a little rough around the edges, but deep inside she's only thinking of her friends and family here in the safehold.
10959 : It looks like something big's brewing...
10960 : I've never been too good with words, but...
10961 : Get out there and do what you have to do. For the safehold's sake, for Prishe's sake...heck, for the world's sake!
10962 : Maybe it's because we've lived in solitude for so long, but a lot of us have a hard time opening up to those from the outside.
10963 : But since you came, things have started to change. Thanks, %...
10964 : You'd better have a look around the safehold while you can, because when our boss gets back, you might not be left with any legs to stand on.
10965 : No, I'm not talking about Justinius. Sure, he's the captain of the Tavnazian Patrol, but all final calls are made by the boss.
10966 : You'll see... Heh heh heh...
10967 : Huh. Still standing, I see. I thought Prishe would have whipped you into a pile of crimson jelly by now.
10968 : I don't know what the boss sees in you, but I'm not one to question her judgment.
10969 : The safehold elder has been calling Prishe the abhorrent one since I was knee-high to a bugard's eye.
10970 : I never actually knew what he was trying to say...
10971 : Come to think of it, I don't even know what abhorrent means!
10972 : You're going to save the boss, right!?
10973 : I didn't think much of you before, and to tell you the truth, I don't think much of you now. But there is one thing I do know, and that is if anybody can help Prishe, it's you!
10974 : I knew you could do it! I never doubted you for a minute! Hey, why don't you join the Tavnazian Patrol? I'd be honored to have a fine [man/woman] like you working under me.
10975 : Hm? You're not done with your journey yet? You adventurers have it hard, don't you?
10976 : There is a young girl living here who the elders all refer to as the abhorrent one.
10977 : Oh, do not worry. You will know her when you see her.
10978 : Everyone in the safehold always follows what Prishe says. Am I the only one who feels that this is even the slightest bit odd?
10979 : Sir Justinius is the captain of the Tavnazian Patrol. He should have authority over all affairs concerning the city.
10980 : However, when it comes to making any sort of decision, all the men run off to that despicable little girl.
10981 : Ah, please do not tell anyone what I just told you. If Tressia or Mengrenaux were to find out, my rations would be cut in half for a week...
10982 : You see, I told you Prishe was a terrible child.
10983 : I can assure you that there will be more problems to come as long as she remains in the safehold!
10984 : A battle with the wyrms... I knew that Prishe would bring misfortune to our peaceful city...
10985 : However, I have a feeling that you and our lea--and that dastardly child will be victorious in your efforts.
10986 : Of course I despise her, but I cannot deny that she is the strongest woman I have ever met.
10987 : Prishe survived the battle, did she not!? Eh? Me, worry about the abhorrent one? Do not be absurd...
10988 : You probably wonder why we have chosen to live our lives under the ground in these caves.
10989 : The roads leading to the old Marquisate capital have sunk to the bottom of the seas, and the surrounding meadows crawl with terrible beasts and remnants of the beastman armies.
10990 : It is amazing that our tiny patrol is even able to maintain the peace in this small corner of the island...
10991 : The sudden influx of visitors from Jeuno has left many of the safehold residents scared and confused. However, I welcome their presence as a blessing.
10992 : I do not wish to be tied to this cursed place for the rest of my life...
10993 : So you plan to wage a war against the Wyrmking and his minions? I apologize, but I fear the Tavnazian Patrol does not possess the manpower to assist you this time.
10994 : However, in your absence we shall ensure the safety of the remaining safehold residents. Good luck, %.
10995 : Welcome home! We are all relieved to see you made it back unharmed.
10996 : How was your ride on the airship? I had heard stories of the flying machines, but I never thought I would have the opportunity to see one up close.
10997 : Perhaps some day I will be blessed with the opportunity to ride one as well...
10998 : That door over there leads to the safehold elder Despachiaire's quarters.
10999 : Even now, elder Despachiaire believes that someday Cardinal Mildaurion will return to Tavnazia.
11000 : The great cardinal who led our fathers out of the flames of despair to this refuge... To us that were born after the Great War, stories of her are as distant as fairy tales.
11001 : I don't understand... After years of following the words of the cardinal, how can the elder believe the utterings of a complete stranger?
11002 : Or maybe he has simply resorted to grasping at any thread of hope, no matter how thin...
11003 : Since Ulmia's departure, Despachiaire has not once left his quarters.
11004 : I believe I now know why he was so quick to trust that Nag'molada.
11005 : All he wanted to do was protect his granddaughter and the people of the safehold from suffering any more than they already had...
11006 : This is the main entrance to the Tavnazian Safehold.
11007 : This is Prishe and Ulmia's room.
11008 : I'd keep your distance if you know what's good for you.
11009 : It's been kind of lonely without Ulmia or the boss around.
11010 : I sure hope nothing happens to Ulmia...
11011 : And Prishe? Oh, I know nothing will happen to Prishe. There isn't a jam she hasn't been able to find her way out of!
11012 : You see? I told you Prishe would be fine.
11013 : But I'd suggest putting your adventures on hold for a while. We wouldn't want to make elder Despachiaire too upset...
11014 : Just when I thought they were back for good, Ulmia and Prishe have run off again.
11015 : I wonder if they'll ever be back...
11016 : You're on your way to fight the wyrms, aren't you? I really wish that Ulmia would reconsider going...
11017 : ...but she wouldn't listen to me, would she...
11018 : Beyond those doors lie the Phomiuna Aqueducts.
11019 : The Phomiuna Aqueducts are connected in many places to the Tavnazian Cathedral's Sacrarium.
11020 : However, during the Great War many of the hallways caved in, making them virtually impassable.
11021 : In addition to that, Cardinal Mildaurion placed a powerful seal on the areas to weaken any beasts that remained in the halls and chambers.
11022 : She sacrificed her life to help the survivors of the burning city. We owe more than our lives to her...
11023 : The door is locked tight.
11024 : This cave leads to the Sealion's Den.
11025 : The cave was once used as a private port for the Tavnazian Cathedral, but now...
11026 : Recently, with all the supply ships from Jeuno coming and going, the port has been very active.
11027 : The nation of Jeuno has offered its hand to help lift up the ailing Tavnazia.
11028 : None of this would have been possible were it not for the kindness of Sir Nag'molada.
11029 : I deeply regret never telling my granddaughter not to fraternize with that abhorrent Prishe.
11030 : They are from different worlds... They should have remained separated.
11031 : I can no longer allow Ulmia to be near those who are only out to deceive her.
11032 : Even if that happened to include an outsider such as you...
11033 : Is Ulmia... Is my granddaughter well?
11034 : Please... I beg of you, do not let anything harm her.
11035 : I have given up trying to hold Ulmia back.
11036 : She has the right to see the world for what it is, and find the destiny that awaits her.
11037 : I now realize that my duty as a grandfather is not to control her, but to watch over her as she walks her own path.
11038 : Young folk these days have become blind to the light of Altana.
11039 : They do not realize it is her blessing that fills this well with water for us to drink...
11040 : May Altana have mercy on their pitiful souls!
11041 : As much as we'd like to rebuild the capital city of Tavnazia, I don't see it happening any time in the near future.
11042 : That place is crawling with remnants of the beastman army, all of them thirsty for the enemy's fresh blood...
11043 : The Tavnazian and San d'Orian Cathedrals both have roots in the same faith that originated centuries ago in the Elvaan kingdom.
11044 : However, under the guidance of Cardinal Mildaurion C Giloumet, the Tavnazian Cathedral eventually branched from the original teachings of the San d'Orian church and began to evolve separately.
11045 : Unfortunately, the Great War put an end to any further development of the Marquisate's culture...
11046 : Now that Jeuno has reinstated ties with Tavnazia, it's only a matter of time before talks with the San d'Orian Cathedral are held.
11047 : But I wonder if San d'Oria will really offer to help us...
11048 : The Phomiuna Aqueducts that connect the safehold with the capital city of Tavnazia are a haven for monsters that feed on the flesh of unprepared travelers.
11049 : However, thanks to a powerful seal the cardinal placed on the area twenty years ago, the power of the beasts is kept to a minimum.
11050 : Unfortunately, the seal also affects anyone else who journeys into the tunnels...
11051 : The abhorrent one lives among us... It is because of this that I often fear for the safety of my children and grandchildren...
11052 : I can only pray that Altana has mercy on those Tavnazians with pure souls...
11053 : ...and strikes down those who bring disaster to our humble city.
11054 : This super-spiffy safe-hold used to be filled with lots of se-cret rooms and hid-den sup-plies.
11055 : But now there's hard-ly a-ny-thing left in this place, not coun-ting dust and cree-py-craw-ly cock-roa-ches, of course.
11056 : I e-ven heard that a long, long, long, long time a-go, the Tav-na-zian Ca-the-dral re-ceived a bunch of mur-der-ous-ly mys-ter-i-ous re-lics from the San d'Or-i-an Ca-the-dral.
11057 : But un-less it's something tip-pity-top tas-ty to munch on, I'm not that in-ter-rest-ed in any mus-ty old an-tiques.
11058 : I have heard stories from passing adventurers claiming all royal members of the Marquisate were killed during the Great War.
11059 : If this is true, then perhaps there is no hope for the future of the Pearl of Zafmlug.
11060 : Goddess Altana! Why do you take so much, while in return only give so little!?
11061 : I washed up on the southern beaches of this island nearly seven years ago when my ship was destroyed in a terrible storm.
11062 : If it were not for the kindness of the people living here, I most surely would have met the same fate as my crewmates...
11063 : Walk through this here cave, and you'll find the headquarters of the Tavnazian Patrol. Travel a little bit further in, and you'll come by Prishe and Ulmia's quarters.
11064 : On the other side of this passageway lies elder Despachiaire's private quarters, as well as the safehold well.
11065 : Back through here you'll find a couple of shops and a whole bunch of cutesy-wootsey, fuzzy-wuzzy moogles!
11066 : Through this cave you'll find a number of storage rooms and warehouses, but most all of them are nearly empty...
11067 : We've transformed the once empty warehouses into auction houses and storage for delivery services. Have the days of glory finally returned to Tavnazia?
11068 : You are an adventurer... I can smell the dark blood of the undead as it drips slowly from your soiled garments.
11069 : Beware, my friend, for you are not alone in your journey. Lost spirits lurk in the shadows behind you, waiting for their chance to rob you of your soul.
11070 : Hmmm...
11071 : You still have a fairly good head start, but they will not let up until they have found you and filled your heart with poison and pain.
11072 : They are close... It is only a matter of time before you have fallen within their reach.
11073 : Can you not feel the hands that reach up from the bottomless depths of hell? Can you not feel the gaze of a thousand eyes, glowing red with anger and hate?
11074 : The grip of evil is tightening on the very essence of what makes you who you are. Be forewarned, as it will not be long before you are confronted with a battle for more than just your life.
11075 : Oh, poor child! May the light of the Dawn Goddess lead you from the pitch-black depths of darkness!
11076 : All the adults say it's too dangerous to go outside and play on the coast, but I'm sick of spending all day locked up in this cave.
11077 : Yeah, I wish we could go out adventuring like the Chebukkis!
11078 : Look what Makki gave me!
11079 : Hey! Kukki said that he was going to give that to me! I'm telling my mommy!
11080 : I wish I was older so I could help my mom...
11081 : Since Dad died, she's been so busy...
11082 : Cherukiki brought my mom a whole barrelful of supplies from the mainland.
11083 : She said she was happy, but I saw her crying. I don't understand adults at all...
11084 : I feel sorry for the children all cooped up here in the safehold, but it is just too dangerous to allow them to play outside.
11085 : I will not say who, but there are three troublemakers who have taken it upon themselves to ignore this rule.
11086 : After returning from Jeuno, those troublesome Tarutaru personally delivered a barrel of supplies to my quarters.
11087 : Maybe I was wrong about them...
11088 : The other day, those three Tarutaru presented me with the charred remains of some awful beast and told me to try it because it was mighty tasty.
11089 : Since they were children, I had always told the Chebukki brothers to never shun from a challenge, but to think I would be tested by my own words...
11090 : Did I show you what Makki brought me back from Jeuno? They are some of the most amazing things I have ever seen.
11091 : One of them was a rare item made in the Far East, but I decided to give it to Yasuji. He said that he used to live in the Eastern empire before his ship wrecked...
11092 : I tell ya, all these here young folk in the safehold ain't never had it hard--'specially those dangnabbed Tarutots!
11093 : Why, back in my day, we had to fight through herds of wild bugards and Orc armies in the snow--with nothin' more than our bare fists--just to make it to the outhouse!
11094 : Well, whaddaya know. Somebody went an' done taught those darn tootin' Tarutots some manners.
11095 : Why, they even brought me a brand-spankin'-new pair of extra fancy wooden teeth from that Jeuno place they moseyed off to.
11096 : The Star of Tav-na-zi-a? Well, we can ass-ume from the name that it's some-thing that was kept in the mar-qui-sate.
11097 : Un-for-tu-nate-ly, I can't tell you much more. May-be some-bo-dy who used to work at the ca-the-dral knows some-thing.
11098 : Young traveler, you don't believe that there is some great treasure hidden in the Sacrarium, do you?
11099 : Well, I hate to be the one who has to tell you this, but there's nothing but old rubbish left in that place--its rooms were raided and plundered years ago.
11100 : The arrival of that Elvaan knight reminded me of a story my teacher used to tell us at grammar school.
11101 : Long ago, there was a frighteningly powerful jewel hidden somewhere in the Marquisate, and to protect us from its evil, Cardinal Mildaurion had placed a powerful seal upon it. I wonder if that tale was true...
11102 : Before the Marquisate of Tavnazia was destroyed, the region was a thriving center for commerce. Ships from all across Vana'diel would grace our nation's ports.
11103 : However, the most prominent were those from the nations of the West. I remember one time a Western vessel carrying a mountain of gold ingots arrived in Tavnazia offering to purchase a jewel known as the something-or-other of Tavnazia.
11104 : My late brother was once a member of the Tavnazian choir. I remember him once telling me that there existed a lost hymn that not a single member of the Tavnazian Cathedral was able to sing.
11105 : He said it was the words from that hymn that would save the children of Altana from their lives of suffering.
11106 : The elder Despachiaire's granddaughter has the most magnificent voice. It is as if you were hearing the whisper of the Dawn Goddess herself.
11107 : However, I remember there being another young girl in the Tavnazian choir who was just as talented as Lady Ulmia.
11108 : If only little Emeline had survived the beastman attack.
11109 : Read the scripture? Yes. No.
11110 : Long, long ago, an ancient race, descended from the gods, flourished in Vana'diel.
11111 : They traveled through the sky, extracted gold from stones, and gave birth to grasslands across the world.
11112 : But one day, they decided to build a pathway to the divine entrance of Paradise.
11113 : Enraged by such a brazen display of insolence, the gatekeeper destroyed their path and cast their homes to the bottom of the sea.
11114 : Shortly thereafter, the goddess Altana awakened and saw the ruin that had once been Vana'diel. Saddened, She wept five divine tears.
11115 : When the five tears fell upon the earth, they gave life to the five races of Vana'diel.
11116 : But the god Promathia saw this from His place in the shadows. The Twilight God saw fit to condemn Altana's work, cursing the people with eternal conflict amongst themselves.
11117 : He created terrible beasts and spread them across the world, commanding them to fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds.
11118 : Never again would they think to open the Gate of the Gods.
11119 : This is the entrance to the Tavnazian Safehold.
11120 : Twenty years ago, we were all overjoyed when news of the allied forces' victory over the Shadow Lord's armies finally reached our island.
11121 : However, deep inside we knew that this would only be a short-lived triumph. As long as there is light in the world, there will always exist darkness.
11122 : For the past twenty years, not a day has gone by when the words of Cardinal Mildaurion haven't rung in my mind.
11123 : The tales of the beastmen and their devilish plan to bring their terrible god back to life, eradicating Vana'diel of mankind's seeds.
11124 : Sometimes at night, I still see visions of the battlefield I stood on twenty years ago. The cold eyes of the Kindred as they searched the landscape for their next victim...
11125 : I remember hearing tales of how the Shadow Lord called up these bloodthirsty beasts from the depths of hell, where their dark leader awaited in slumber...
11126 : Only in a p-place like this c-can a m-m-m-man like m-m-m-me hide from the ridicule of the w-world.
11127 : Hm? Oh...um... Yes... Pay n-no heed t-to m-m-m-y ramblings...
11128 : I thought that in a p-place like this, I m-m-m-might be able to hide from the r-ridicule of the w-world. However, n-now that Tavnazia has reopened its doors to the outside...
11129 : B-but... You understand...r-right? No?
11130 : I never really needed a mannequin to remind me how beautiful my Alsha was...is.
11131 : That's right. From now on, she'll be here, right by my side...
11132 : Are you trying to tell me you have lost...?
11133 : Here. You must learn to cherish them with all you heart.
11135 : Hail the proud and valiant knights of Tavnazia! Raise the pennants and cheer us on to victory!
11136 : Your business here, [sir/madame]? You seek a young maiden and her airborne, alabaster companion?
11137 : Why, the lady in question passed my trial and joined our illustrious order, just as you did!
11138 : Why, the lady in question passed my trial and joined the Tavnazian order of knights!
11139 : The fiery young damsel is on a quest to find the famous Goldmane!
11140 : Thus I imparted to her the location of the bounty hunter's birthplace!
11141 : He was raised in a shepherd's village found in the west of the Tavnazian archipelago.
11142 : That land is now the site of tremendous change brought about by fell sorcery!
11143 : Goldmane was born in that quiet village, but was loath to follow the shepherd's path. After moving to Tavnazia, he took up the mercenary trade of the bounty hunter!
11144 : When he met and married a lady mage, however, Goldmane's footsteps led him back to the place of his birth to start a family.
11145 : People will always find their way back to the beginning. The same holds true when we reach the end of our path in life.
11146 : Yes, I once was a merchant selling Tavnazian crafts to the San d'Orian Cathedral. But that was long ago...
11147 : Hmph... I suppose you wonder how a mere merchant rose to the position of safehold elder.
11148 : The answer is simple, young [man/woman]. I have merely outlived all those more qualified.
11149 : However, do not be mistaken. Not once did I ask to be granted this position, and not once have I used it for any sort of personal gain.
11150 : I apologize. I seem to have diverged from the matter at hand. Forget what you have heard... Just as I have forgotten the countless tribulations of my past...
11151 : Yes. You wished to inquire about Tavnazian cuisine. I suggest you speak with Jonette. She can be found with her daughter, down near the underground tributary.
11152 : Jonette is well known throughout the safehold for her undying interest in Tavnazian dishes. She will more than likely be able to answer any questions you may have on the subject.
11153 : Ah, you wouldn't happen to be an adventurer, would you? I usually avoid pestering others with my problems, but I find myself in a fix.
11154 : Recently, I have begun studying traditional Tavnazian cooking methods.
11155 : However, our libraries contain no books on the subject, and the mists of time have clouded the memories of the safehold elders.
11156 : Our current state of affairs limits the bounty that we can bring to our children's plates. That is why I felt that rekindling the culinary arts of Tavnazia's past would rejuvenate the spirits of this cave's weary souls.
11157 : You wouldn't have happened to come across anything on your journey that may be of use, would you?
11158 : If you were to find something, I would be so grateful...as would all the other safehold residents.
11159 : %! This is exactly the information I have been searching for!
11160 : Your kindness is a blessing that will bring smiles to the dinner tables of Tavnazia.
11161 : I know it is not much, but please accept this as a token of my appreciation.
11162 : The information you have brought me on Tavnazian cuisine has been a wonderful help!
11163 : If you happen to find any more, the children would be so delighted.
11164 : Your fate rides on the changing winds of Vana'diel. I can give you insight on the local weather.
11165 : What area's weather do you wish to know? Nowhere. Ronfaure. La Theine Plateau. Valkurm Dunes. Jugner Forest. Batallia Downs. Gustaberg. Konschtat Highlands. Pashhow Marshlands.

11206 : Justinius! If I could have a moment of your time...
11207 : Eh? Why of course, Chemioue. But as you can see, I am quite busy at the moment. Perhaps we could speak a little while later.
11208 : And of how many hours might a little while construe?
11209 : I am going to need a little more time to come to a specific number...
11210 : Hmph. If that is the case...
11211 : ...You! How long have you been standing there?
11212 : You must know that it is quite impolite to eavesdrop on a lady's private conversation! Why, now that I think of it, there is only one other person who would do something so atrocious... Prishe!
11213 : You know of whom I speak. Recently, a day does not go by without the other safehold residents reveling over that hooligan's every action.
11214 : Prishe repaired my subligar, Prishe dueled an Orcish Serjeant, Prishe saved my baby from a Megalobugard... Prishe, Prishe, Prishe, Prishe, Prishe!
11215 : If I hear that name one more time, I am going to scream so loud, the Mithra in Kazham will have to cover their ears to prevent them from exploding!
11216 : Do not mistake me. I know full well what that ruffian is capable of accomplishing.
11217 : It is just... It is how she goes about making those accomplishments. Subtle is a word that was unfortunately torn from her dictionary the day she was born.
11218 : And what of Justinius? Our fearless leader ignores him like a chamber pot in the closet, leaving him to rot in the belly of this cave while she is off frolicking in the meadows!
11219 : Who does she think she is!? Just because she had some terrible accident when she was a child does not give her the right to strut about the archipelago like she was the marquise!
11220 : Unfortunately, most people, including poor Justinius, are blind to the truth--that she is nothing more than a selfish little brat with a mouth filthier than the backside of my boot!
11221 : You agree with me, do you not? Or have you been brainwashed like all the others--the wool pulled over your very sense of reasoning?
11222 : Do you truly believe that brute force and raw ambition will lead us to Paradise?
11223 : Well, I certainly cannot. You will not witness me become a victim of that fiend's attempts at subjugation!
11224 : Chemioue!
11225 : You're not preaching about Prishe to this outsider, are you?
11226 : Tr-Tressia! How long have you been standing there?
11227 : How long? Have you seen me standing anywhere else?
11228 : <Sigh>...
11229 : Chemioue, when are you going to put aside your feelings about Prishe and start concentrating on your duties?
11230 : But I...I...
11231 : Aren't you supposed to be on your rounds? Or were you so busy talking to this adventurer that you forgot?
11232 : I was just...
11233 : When are you going to grow up and stop letting your emotions get in the way of things?
11234 : Wait one moment! You are the last person to tell someone they need to grow up! Why, just last week I remember you holding Mengrenaux in a headlock because he would not lend you his buckler.
11235 : That has nothing to do with anything! We're talking about you and Prishe here, Chemioue. Stop trying to change the subject!
11236 : Change the subject? Were it not for your meddling, there would be no subject of which to speak!
11237 : My opinions are merely a reflection of the discontent that dwells deep within the hearts of all Tavnazians.
11238 : Not once have my feelings for that blue-haired sea worm ever impaired my judgment! Never!
11239 : Hah hah hah!
11240 : Are you suggesting I speak not the truth?
11241 : Listen up, Chemioue. I could care less if you swore on Eonnite's Revelations. That's not the point.
11242 : The point is, unlike sniffling little children, adults know when to keep their opinions to themselves.
11243 : Hmph!
11244 : Here we go again...
11245 : I hope that she knows that I'm only saying these things because I want to help her.
11246 : You see, when she was thirteen, Chemioue lost her older brother to an overgrown rose. Ever since then, she's turned to Justinius to fill the void in her heart left by her brother's death.
11247 : Chemioue feels anger towards Prishe only because she's trying to protect Justinius.
11248 : I just wish there was someone who could convince Chemioue of her faults before she does something drastic.
11249 : If that Parelbriaux were only a little more reliable...
11250 : Oh, Parelbriaux! Why does Tressia always have to side with that wench!?
11251 : Calm down, Chemioue. While you may have your differences, you should not speak that way of your friend.
11252 : What is this? Do not tell me that you, too, have lost your mind.
11253 : No, I was just...
11254 : You were just...? Come on now. Speak up!
11255 : I was just thinking that maybe you're not giving Prishe a fair chance.
11256 : A fair chance!? I--
11257 : There are a lot of people in the safehold who look to Prishe for strength and guidance. What about those people?
11258 : Those people...
11259 : Since when did you start thinking about anyone other than your precious Ul--
11260 : Hm? Did you say something?
11261 : No, no. 'Twas the wind, mayhap...
11262 : Anyway, you'd feel much better if--
11263 : I told you, as long as she is around, my heart and my mind shall never be at ease!
11264 : <Sigh> Well, if that is how you really feel, why don't you tell her yourself? Or do you not have the confidence to face her?
11265 : You should talk! If anyone lacks confidence, 'tis you!
11266 : ... Yes, maybe if I had more confidence, I could show everyone I'm more than just a doorboy...
11267 : And maybe I could tell her my true feelings...
11268 : No. That would never work...
11269 : What about you, Chemioue? What if you could prove to everyone that you were just as strong and brave as Prishe?
11270 : Why should I risk my life for something as foolish as that?
11271 : Just thinking of myself in the same precarious predicaments as Prishe makes me shudder.
11272 : She always brags that her encounters were nothing but danger that she must face...
11273 : Wait a minute...
11274 : Could that be a hint of worry I sense?
11275 : Pr-preposterous! Worry about the abhorrent one!? You must be mad!
11276 : I do not know why I even came here in the first place!
11277 : Come to think of it, I have much more important matters to attend to.
11278 : Do you recall the item I spoke to you about last Firesday? Well, I have finally learned where they grow.
11279 : Supposedly, they only appear when the weather is quite humid. Let me show you the map I copied from an old tome I came across in the Sacrarium library...
11280 : Wait! Where is my bag? Oh, I do not know why, but this is all her fault!
11281 : Ah, hello.
11282 : I'm sorry that you had to see that. Please don't judge Chemioue by her words. Inside, she is truly a good person.
11283 : Where did she run off to? Probably to find her bag. Chemioue is always misplacing things.
11284 : If she'd only ask Ondieulix. He knows everything that goes on in and around the safehold.
11285 : I told her to see him, but she said she could find the bag herself and to keep my bloody nose out of her business.
11286 : Sometimes Chemioue can be quite stubborn, but she means well.
11287 : Anyway, if you are looking for more information, why don't you visit Ondieulix?
11288 : He's stationed near the safehold's main entrance.
11289 : What is this? You say you are looking for a bag? Well, I do not recall...
11290 : No, wait. I did come across a small pack while patrolling the entrances. Now, where did I put that...?
11291 : !!!
11292 : Parelbriaux! Are you all right? Those wounds are fresh. I thought you were on guard duty today.
11293 : I went out for a bit...to check for signs of an...um...Orc raid on the safehold. I got a few scratches on the way back, but I'll be fin--ow-ow-ow-ow...
11294 : Yes, and my grandfather's a Galka!
11295 : Now, why don't you tell me why you were really out there?
11296 : ... I don't know... I was talking with Chemioue and this adventurer, and I had this urge to go out and...
11297 : I know I shouldn't have gone out alone, but...
11298 : I guess I'll never be as strong as Prishe.
11299 : As strong as Prishe?
11300 : Why would you wish that?
11301 : Almost every day I hear stories about Prishe and adventurers like % fighting terrible foes in faraway lands. Maybe I just wondered why I couldn't do the same.
11302 : Yes, I, too, have seen the similarities between Prishe and the adventurers who pass through our gates. Their courage and ambition never cease to amaze me.
11303 : Perhaps it is not their ability to succeed that impresses us, but their lack of fear towards failure that shines brightest.
11304 : Or maybe not fear of failure, but...
11305 : I do not know quite how to put it.
11306 : Prishe is... She is...
11307 : I know what you mean, Ondieulix. She has that something that just can't be explained in one or two words.
11308 : Either way, I'll never be of her caliber. When I saw that monster running after me today, the first thing my instincts told me to do was run and hide in the nearest shed.
11309 : Some great adventurer I am, huh...
11310 : I would not be so hard on myself, Parelbriaux. You are still alive, are you not?
11311 : A truly skilled adventurer knows when he is outmatched.
11312 : Yes, but I wouldn't have been outmatched if I were more like Prishe...
11313 : With the passing of each day, I see the people around me growing stronger, while I remain the same.
11314 : It is often easy to witness change in others, never realizing that you, too, are transforming as well.
11315 : But...
11316 : Do you think that I have not spent hours, days, standing here pondering over the same trivial issues? I know how you feel, Parelbriaux. However, your situation is not as dire as you may believe it to be.
11317 : But enough of this idle chat. You should have someone tend to your wounds.
11318 : What of Chemioue? She is one of the finest physicians we have.
11319 : I don't know if that's such a good idea...
11320 : What? Do not tell me you two had another one of your arguments.
11321 : It wasn't really an argument. It was more like...well... Yes, we had an argument. And you know how she can be when she's rubbed the wrong way.
11322 : Now that you mention it, it might not be so wise to go to her right away...considering I used some of the medicine in her bag on your cuts.
11323 : Even though it is Chemioue who should be more careful with her possessions, if she finds out that I opened her pack without permission, she'll have my head on a plate!
11324 : Careful with her possessions...
11325 : Yes. Chemioue dropped her bag when she came running through the Porte d'Esmodille.
11326 : Dropped...when running... Oh no! They're gone!
11327 : I must have dropped them while running from that monster!
11328 : What are you rambling on about, man?
11329 : The petals--from a rare variety of flower that only grows in the Lufaise Meadows.
11330 : We read somewhere that they are supposed to have remarkable healing properties. She thought that if we could find one and bring it back to the safehold, we could help all the sick children...
11331 : Hmmm... If we hurry, there might still be some petals left where you found the others. However, you are too injured to leave the safehold, and I cannot leave my post... Quite a predicament, I say.
11332 : Ah! What about this adventurer?
11333 : I realize that you are busy with your adventuring escapades, but could you lend us your services, if only for a few moments?
11334 : It would mean the world to Parelbriaux if you could run out and retrieve one of those petals of which he was speaking.
11335 : And if not for him, do it for the safehold's dying children...
11336 : Please, fine [sir/lady]. You are our only hope.
11337 : Welcome back, %. Is that the item Parelbriaux was searching for? Quite an odor, I must say.
11338 : Hm? Have I seen Chemioue? Why, yes. She passed by here a few moments ago. However, she ran by so quickly, I was unable to ask her the details of her journey.
11339 : Chemioue? What's wrong? You look like you just ran from the far side of the island.
11340 : These cuts? Oh, they're not as bad as they--
11341 : Ow-ow-ow-ow...
11342 : Who do you think you are trying to impress with this macho act? Now stop acting like a buffoon and show me your wounds.
11343 : You're not still mad at me, are...hm? This ointment... It smells like...
11344 : Well, it is safe to say that your nose was not injured during your little adventure. You are correct. This ointment is made from the flowers that grow in Lufaise. An adventurer was generous enough to give me one of [his/hers] when I was out in the meadows.
11345 : Oh...
11346 : According to [him/her], you also found some earlier.
11347 : Yes, but I...
11348 : But you were only what? Trying to show off to her?
11349 : What do you...? I don't understand.
11350 : Really? I was positive you were out risking your neck for that beautiful, tall woman...
11352 : ...with the flowing red hair...
11353 : !!
11354 : ...and the voice of an angel.
11355 : !!!
11356 : Are you to tell me I am mistaken?
11357 : Y-you couldn't be farther from the truth!
11358 : Am I...? You seem quite flustered.
11359 : W-w-why would I lie about something like that!?
11360 : Amazing... It doesn't hurt anymore. You've become quite a fine physician, Chemioue.
11361 : Do you really believe so?
11362 : It feels quite awkward being praised by the likes of you, Parelbriaux...
11363 : ... Thank you.
11364 : Did I just hear what I think I heard...?
11365 : You wish to know what I told Chemioue before she left for the meadows?
11366 : Very well. As you may already know, Chemioue's older brother was involved in a terrible accident that eventually claimed his life.
11367 : What was most unfortunate was that the wounds her brother received were not incurable. However, there was no one in the safehold at the time that had the skills required to heal him.
11368 : Since then, the study of medicine has become Chemioue's passion. Perhaps she cannot live with the thought of someone else having to bear the same burden that she did.
11369 : In any case, those of us who know her pain often treat her as if she were our little sister. And I feel that I might have, well...scolded her a little too hard.
11370 : You see, she often looks down upon adventurous types such as yourself, probably because your lack of fear in the face of danger reminds Chemioue of a trait also found in her lost sibling.
11371 : I simply told her that while it may be difficult, she needs to open her heart and learn to accept people for who they are and what they do, and not necessarily the manner in which they do those things.
11372 : I apologize that you had to be caught up in the petty affairs of our humble safehold. Please accept this as a token of our gratitude.
11373 : Your kindness may have opened a door to a heart that has been locked up for far too long.
11374 : I hear word that you aided Jonette in her search for lost Tavnazian cuisine.
11375 : She was simply overjoyed with the recipes you brought her...
11376 : I wonder if I might ask you a question...
11377 : From whom did you learn of my previous occupation as a merchant carrying goods between San d'Oria and Tavnazia?
11378 : A Lady Rouva, you say...? That name stirs the echo of a long-silent memory.
11379 : If this lady knows of my past, then perhaps she also remembers my dearly departed wife.
11380 : Would you spare a moment to indulge an old man's sentimentality...?
11381 : This belonged to my wife.
11382 : I know not where or whence it was crafted...
11383 : My wife prized this possession above all others, but never had the chance to speak of its origin before she...
11384 : If you have the opportunity to visit the city of San d'Oria, mayhap you could ask Lady Rouva of its significance? May Altana keep you safe on your travels, %.
11385 : You have discovered the origin of my wife's %? And I see you have gone to the trouble of restoring its sheen, as well.
11386 : There is an inscription on the %, you say?
11387 : Let me see here... Regrets wilt not plague...
11388 : %... Would you care to listen to a story?
11389 : Our only daughter, Ulmia's mother, was a deeply pious child.
11390 : Perhaps it was the influence of my wife with her upbringing in the San d'Orian Cathedral.
11391 : In those days I was assailed by complicated feelings every time my wife and daughter would speak of the Goddess...
11392 : Feelings of estrangement and guilt... So many unruly emotions surged within me. After all, I was but a simple merchant with no great understanding of philosophy or religion.
11393 : I felt I had stolen my wife away from her faith. Did she ever regret her decision to marry me?
11394 : Even after my wife left this world, and later when Ulmia's parents joined her in Paradise, these doubts continued to gnaw at my soul.
11395 : Ulmia greatly resembles her mother and grandmother in many respects. I see the same features, the same faith, the same talent...
11396 : When Ulmia declared she would once again leave the safehold, I thought my heart would burst with apprehension.
11397 : I entertained the thought that Altana had come to claim my granddaughter as well...
11398 : But I believe that Ulmia holds to her own type of faith.
11399 : And that my wife held no regrets...
11400 : More than anything, I wish to keep my faith in that belief.
11401 : No regrets...
11402 : Thank you for listening so long to my ramblings.
11403 : Please accept this for putting a grandfather's heart at ease.
11404 : Why, you don't look like you are a native to the archipelago. Are you trapped here as well?
11405 : I traveled to Jeuno from my home country in the Near East to continue my research in various types of matter and antimatter. However, one day while I was collecting specimens in the caves around Delkfutt's Tower, I fell into some strange vortex. When I woke up, I found myself here on this island with no way to return home.
11406 : How am I supposed to continue my studies in such an inconvenient location!?
11407 : Hmmm... The reverse fluctuation of alpha-thermo waves can be considered a sign of protomutation...
11408 : But the resulting flow of exoparticles that accompanies the hyporeaction drastically hinders the growth of new biomatter...
11409 : H-how dare you sneak up on a lady like that! Leave now before I call the Tavnazian Patrol!
11410 : Hm? You would like to know what I'm doing? It's fairly complicated, and you look awfully busy...
11411 : Hm? You would like to know what I'm doing? I don't know... You probably won't find it very interesting...
11412 : Hm? You would like to know what I'm doing? I don't think it concerns you, but...
11413 : Well...? Hurry up and tell me! If you put it that way.
11414 : Alright... Recently I've begun research on new methods of matter processing. If I succeed, my theories could rival the primitive methods of conventional synthesis.
11415 : Very good. Now be on your way so I can return to my studies.
11416 : You see, in addition to crystals, there are certain unique types of matter that, when used as a catalyst, can transmogrify normal, everyday items into creations never seen before by man or woman! I like to call that substance Xenomatter.
11417 : I'm still in the beginning stages of my research, but I've already discovered a way to manipulate Xenomatter in a way that it can be used to multiply the strength and durability of certain materials. I hope that my further studies will result in the discovery of even more benefits.
11418 : Let me explain further... For example, say I was to attempt to alter the polymolecular makeup of this clam using the Xenomatter in question. As you know, this particular variety of clam only lives in the shallows of a certain tiny island far off the coast of southeastern Mindartia.
11419 : To find one of these specimens, not only would one have to be an expert on the clam's native habitat, but also be knowledgeable of their mating and feeding patterns, their reactions to the rise and fall of geothermal temperature levels, as well as their migratory tendencies, and how all these are affected by the varying seasonal lunar cycles. In other words, it is extremely difficult.
11420 : However, large quantities of this rare species of bivalve mollusk are crucial in order to procure enough reliable data to prove my hypotheses infallible. Unfortunately, due to the difficulty in acquiring the specimens, I often find myself in quite a predicament. A single experiment consists of placing three medium-sized clams in a hypophosphorous chamber laced with a small quantity of Xenomatter.
11421 : After sealing the box with a cermopolymer compound (to prevent unnecessary carbo-oxidization), it is only a matter of minutes before a micronucleic reaction occurs and a minute quantity of fluoroplasm is released.
11422 : I have come to the conclusion that the energy for this reaction comes from the calcitron particles concealed within the mucocide membranes located between the abdominal region of the clam and its shell. Unfortunately, during the plasmatic release of free radicals, the specimen experiences a rapid loss of aminofluids and eventually turns to ash, therefore preventing me from using the same clam in a future test.
11423 : Overall, while I realize that the impact the excessive gathering of new specimens may have on the island's aquaculture could be catastrophic, I am ultimately left with no other option. Who am I to turn my back on scientific progress?
11424 : Now as I was saying, when applied to the clams, the Xenomatter causes a photomutegenic reaction that eventually reduces the specimen to a pile of neutrinogen-rich ashes (those ashes tend to be alkaline-based; however, I have yet to determine the significance of this phenomenon).
11425 : If I can find the reason behind the aminofluid loss and its relation with the plasmatic release, I may be able to explain the finite relation of the clams' hydroplasma-oriented biomorphic structure to the quasizymotic nature of Xenomatter. And if I succeed in that, it won't be long before I am...
11426 : Ow! I bit my thongue... Um... Won't the long thefore I...I...uthe that data to therfect a new nethod of natter throthething. ......... ...... ...
11427 : Did you get all that?
11428 : Well, no matter. Now leave me alone. I have to return to my studies.
11429 : By combining these techniques with the existing laws of biomechanics, I hope to one day discover a method of introducing life into non-sentient beings.
11430 : Currently I'm researching a way to utilize the vines from creatures of the malboro family in building a machine that will automatically sort and pack items.
11431 : So whenever you need an extra hand around the house, you can always call on my handy creation, handmade from a monster with more...hands than...
11432 : ...it...can...handle...? Ha ha?
11433 : Well, I told you it wasn't going to be very interesting!
11434 : I've begun research on new types of eyeglasses. If I succeed, my creations could rival the various brands used by the craft workers in guilds across Vana'diel...
11435 : However, I'm not having much luck. Optometry is a much more difficult field than you may think.
11436 : Excellent...
11437 : Hm? What am I so excited about? Why, my research, of course. I'm finally able to move into the final stage of my experiment.
11438 : Let me introduce myself. My name is Yurim. I've traveled from my country in the Near East to study various alternative methods of advanced synthesis.
11439 : Since I was a child, my dream has been to discover a new method of matter processing that doesn't rely on the elemental energy of crystals. Recently, I have focused my research on the fusion of magnetically opposite items, and just yesterday I made a most interesting discovery.
11440 : I realized that I was not delving into a new area of study...
11441 : ...but one that existed long ago before being lost in the annals of time.
11442 : The secrets of the ancients, I guess you could call it.
11443 : Now I could sit and try to explain all this to you, but you don't look like the type that has time to listen to a woman ramble on about beta-quasiparticles and hyponitric mitosis. It would be much more time-effective to simply show you what I mean.
11444 : If you are interested, you will need to bring me the following items: First, I will require a tiny hexagonal chip of the variety often found buried about Quon.
11445 : Secondly, I will require % or %. % would also produce magnificent results, but I fear you may not have much luck in locating this rare item.
11446 : It doesn't matter which one you bring, as long as it isn't too badly damaged.
11447 : Once you succeed in procuring the two items, hurry back here and I'll begin on the experiment.
11448 : A colored hexagonal chip and %, %, or %. Bring me these two items and I will show you the discovery I have made.
11449 : Ah, % and %...
11450 : Um... And...
11451 : Ummm......
11452 : I'd like to thank you for your effort in bringing me these items, but I'm afraid I won't be able to continue my experiment at this moment.
11453 : You see, earlier today I was supposed to receive a special shipment from a party of Moblin peddlers, but the conniving creatures never showed up. It was with the rare items in that shipment that I was to attempt to alter the molecular makeup of the % you brought me.
11454 : Only recently discovered, this type of strange matter is seemingly made up of thousands of independent biolumin organisms working together in some sort of symbiotic harmony. However, due to the immediate lack of untainted samples, little is known about it. There isn't even an official name for the matter.
11455 : While I've seen them rob, cheat, and kill, I've never known a Moblin to lie, so I think it can be safe to say there exists a place somewhere where we can obtain a few of these mysterious items.
11456 : Now, where that place could be...
11457 : You wouldn't happen to have any idea, would you?
11458 : I don't know exactly how many samples I'll need, but I can assume that one or two will definitely not be enough.
11459 : If you happen to come across anything that resembles what I have just described, please do not dispose of it.
11460 : Bring me a collection of samples and I will reward you by allowing you to witness firsthand one of the greatest discoveries in Vana'diel history!
11461 : I cannot show you the results of my research with only % and %.
11462 : Once you have collected a large sample of biolumin matter, return here and I will begin my experiment... I promise!
11463 : All this research has sent my blood sugar levels plummeting. I could sure go for a hot apple pie...
11464 : What? %, for me?
11465 : Mmmmmm... Pie......
11466 : Eureka! I think I've got it! Remember when I told you the matter I was searching for was from an organism that is made up of cells that work independently? What does that remind you of?
11467 : That's it! A jellyfish! Perhaps the things we are looking for anatomically resemble some type of jellyfish!
11468 : Hm? Hrmmm... Aha! I see a meadow! Yes... I wonder if this thing we seek has anything to do with flowers...
11469 : Aha! My tremendous years of experience can lead us to a conclusion most satisfying, as long as we do a little of this and a little of that...
11470 : Like # ) and # )!
11471 : Or # ), # ), and # )!
11472 : Or maybe even # ), # ), # ), and # )!
11473 : Ah, only a master could come up with this %!
11474 : This substance... Could this be...!?
11475 : Ah, yes. The experiment. Let me begin right away!
11476 : <Bubble...bubble...>
11477 : <Fizz......bubble...bubble...>
11478 : ..................
11479 : Wah! My eyes!
11480 : Ah! My jacket!
11481 : Ugh! The smell!
11482 : Wait... This reaction... Yes! It's exactly what my hypothesis predicted!
11483 : The bonding of the hexochip's nanoplasmatic beta-quasiparticles with the polyfluorescent biomatter has resulted in the artificial generation of an exodermic layer of neoluminic residue on the armor. In other words, the power of the original item has been enhanced exponentially!
11484 : Also, this data leads me to believe that different combinations of chips and items will result in objects differing from the one we produced today.
11485 : If you would like to take part in another experiment, bring a single colored chip and %, %, or %.
11486 : And if those Moblin peddlers don't show, I might need you to bring some more of the biolumin matter as well.
11487 : Thank you again for all your assistance, and I hope I can work with you again in the future. You make a fine assistant!
11488 : Ah, I see that this time you've brought me % and %.
11489 : Now all we need is a few samples of biolumin matter.
11490 : The Moblin peddlers? No, I'm sorry to say that they still haven't shown. I'm beginning to wonder if they ever will...
11491 : I can feel them... Can't you feel them? They're all around us. Breathing down our necks. Scratching at our doors. It's only a matter of time before they...
11492 : You had better get ready, for if you don't, you could be their next...victim!
11493 : I can't feel them... I can't feel their presence anymore! You must have succeeded in sending one back into the hell from which it spawned forth.
11494 : But I sense that it won't be long before the beast rears its head once more. It might be as soon as # (# Earth time)!
11495 : I can feel them... They're close, and getting closer! You're an adventurer, right? You know what I'm talking about--those things up on Cape Riverne.
11496 : If we don't do something now, there's no telling what terrible fate awaits us. I'd go myself, but I have a bad case of bunions on my left foot.
11497 : Oh, if I could only use this artifact to call forth the terrible beasts from their grottoes. Then I could vanquish them and free Tavnazia--no, Vana'diel--from the doom that lurks in the darkness!
11498 : Where did I obtain this rare item, you ask? It was not but a few days ago that a strange merchant from the Far East visited the safehold. When he said he was selling magical items that could be used in defeating wretched wyrms and deadly dragons, I sold most of my belongings and purchased all he had.
11499 : Here, why don't you take one? No, I don't need any reimbursement. Just knowing that a brave, strong adventurer such as yourself now has the ability to become the savior of mankind gives me peace of mind.
11500 : But be forewarned. The wrath of the monsters that dwell on the cape will not easily be quelled. Take care in your journey, and if you ever need another one of these artifacts, do not hesitate to ask!
11501 : I recall creating % with these materials before. If I am to break new ground with my scientific research, we must experiment with unknown combinations!
11502 : Eh? Wha? Huh? Oh? Y-you look l-like a w-well-traveled perso...[lad...no, man/woman].
11503 : Y-you w-wouldn't happen to h-have um...seen...heard of s-something called a m-m-m-mannequin before, would you?
11504 : See, I m-myself used to be...no, am a b-builder of m-m-m-mannequins.
11505 : B-bet you d-didn't think there were any l-left... Hm? There's one in M-M-M-Mhaura? Oh.........oh...
11506 : Um, well...yes, anyway... Y-you've heard the t-terrible t-tales of the m-m-m-mannequin's history, no?
11507 : Thanks to those awful r-rumors, builders such as myself were l-labeled w-warlocks and w-witches, hexspinners and c-curseweavers. W-we were pushed...kicked...out of t-towns, forced to w-wander the world as v-v-v-vagrants. T-Tavnazia was the only p-place that would take in s-someone like m-m-m-me.
11508 : ...B-but we artists are always m-m-m-misunderstood, w-wouldn't you say? O-or maybe n-not say... I'm sorry...oh...
11509 : (Oh, now what sh-shall I do? I've g-gone and m-m-m-made the adventurer m-m-m-mad. [Sh... He'll/He... She'll] n-never help m-m-m-me now... No, I have to t-try...!)
11510 : Uh, um... If it w-would not be too m-m-m-much t-trouble... Could I ask of y-your assistance? P-payment? Oh, yes, why yes, of c-course yes! I w-wouldn't think...yes...um, yes!
11511 : H-here, have a look at m-m-m-my w-work...m-m-m-masterpieces. Beautiful, yes? M-m-m-magnificent, no? Yes? No...? Um...oh...well...
11512 : Well, they, they are not yet c-complete. I still need...no, r-require one more m-m-m-material. B-but where to find it...?
11513 : Hm? Ah! Wh-what about this s-so-called m-m-m-mannequin builder in M-M-M-Mhaura?
11514 : P-perhaps she knows s-something...she m-m-m-must know something...she m-m-m-m-m...
11515 : Huh? Oh! %! Lubric...um..oil! That is wh-what I need. Y-you will help m-m-m-me, yes? No? Y-yes?
11516 : Oil! Yes, oh, yes! Thank y-you!
11517 : N-now I can finish my greatest work!
11518 : A masterpiece! A true masterpiece! She's...she's...
11519 : Hm, eh? Wh-what...I mean, w-who is this m-m-m-mannequin m-m-m-modeled after?
11520 : Uh... Well... I... She... Her name...name is Alsha...
11521 : She w-was...no, is...no, was...um...
11522 : ...my w-wife...
11523 : But y-you don't want to hear about that...hm? You do? Eh......oh...
11524 : Well, thirty...t-twenty years ago......
11525 : I w-was still wandering from city to city, t-trying to find someone...anyone who w-would appreciate m-m-m-my work...m-m-m-my m-m-m-masterpieces.
11526 : However, as I t-told you before, m-m-m-mannequins were seen as...cursed creations and their b-builders were...I was...shunned.
11527 : If I had s-simply put down m-m-m-my chisel, I could have s-started over, but my heart...soul wouldn't let me. So I continued m-m-m-making m-m-m-mannequins.
11528 : Though, amidst the b-bashing...finger-pointing, there was one p-person who did not fear or ridicule me...Alsha...
11529 : Beautiful, understanding... She s-saw me for who I was, not who I was m-m-m-made out to be. She cared for me...stood by m-m-m-me when others w-would not.
11530 : She told m-m-m-me of a place where I m-m-m-might be accepted... And so we traveled to her place of birth--Tavnazia...here.
11531 : In this quiet k-kingdom, I was not looked d-down upon. I was not feared because of some foolish rumors. After years of wandering, I had finally found m-m-m-my place.
11532 : And it w-was all thanks to Alsha... We were m-m-m-meant...destined to be together...
11533 : B-but then...
11534 : It was a clear day. Alsha and I w-were walking along the M-M-M-Misareaux Coast collecting flowers...wildflowers to use for her w-wedding bouquet...
11535 : And then the light c-c-c-came. A radiant burst so p-powerful, m-m-m-my eyes seared with pain even though they were shut tight.
11536 : I clutched m-m-m-my Alsha as she sh-shivered with fear, but that was the last I felt of her, for the next moment brought a blast that m-m-m-must have knocked m-m-m-me back at least t-twenty y-yalms.
11537 : When I finally was able to open m-m-m-my eyes, I saw only a barren w-wasteland, smoke rising from the charred remnants of wh-what were once trees and rocks and...
11538 : And m-m-m-my Alsha...
11539 : Oh, wh-why was she taken from me? Why did she p-perish while I survived, unscathed? What sort of c-cruel game was Altana playing with our l-lives?
11540 : After the d-destruction, I retreated to the safehold and spent m-m-m-many m-m-m-months...years in front of the altar of the dawn, pleading to the G-Goddess for answers to m-m-m-my questions.
11541 : However, no m-m-m-matter how m-m-m-much I prayed, not once would she p-provide m-m-m-me with an answer.
11542 : So I w-was left with no choice. I would dedicate my life at t-taking back what Altana had torn away from m-m-m-me.
11543 : B-building these m-m-m-mannequins has helped m-m-m-me fill the hole in my heart...soul that was ripped open b-by that accursed light t-twenty years ago.
11544 : But now m-m-m-my sight is fading...as it has since that t-terrible day.
11545 : It won't be long before m-m-m-my whole world is enveloped in d-darkness... Ironic, d-don't you think? That a light so b-brilliant could m-m-m-make a m-m-m-man's world so bleak...
11546 : And that is why I wanted...no, n-needed to finish m-m-m-my work as soon as possible. So I could see m-m-m-my Alsha once m-m-m-more before m-m-m-my own time had come.
11547 : I'm sorry for t-taking so m-m-m-much...too m-m-m-much of your time.
11548 : Thank you again for all y-your help. Yes... Thank you...
11549 : Hm? You are glad I was able to complete m-m-m-my m-m-m-masterpiece? Complete...? Yes...um, well, yes...
11550 : Oh, I almost forgot. Here is your p-payment. I apologize that I have nothing m-m-m-more to give.
11551 : Hm? Oh...wha? I remember you. You're the fine [la...m-m-m-man/m-m-m-ma...woma]...adventurer that assisted m-m-m-me in building m-m-m-my m-m-m-masterpiece.
11552 : Eh? Did I ever finish? Well...
11553 : ......
11554 : (Should we tell [him/her]? I don't know. [He/She] did help us before, but... Oh, but what harm could it do? M-m-m-maybe [he/she] c-can even help us in the final stages...)
11555 : I c-could let you in on a secret, yes...no...but only if you swear to k-keep it a secret. Can I t-trust you?
11556 : There is one last thing I m-m-m-must do before I can call m-m-m-my m-m-m-masterpiece complete...
11557 : G-give her a soul...
11558 : You look s-surprised? I was as well when I first heard of this little-known t-technique.
11559 : B-but recently, I have come to believe...to know that such a p-procedure is p-possible. You have seen the Cardians of Windurst, have you not, yes?
11560 : And that's n-not all. Just yesterday I overheard Chemioue s-speak of an even m-m-m-more intriguing m-m-m-method.
11561 : Supposedly, a p-powerful wizard resides deep within the m-m-m-murky depths of the Phomiuna Aqueducts.
11562 : But not j-just any wizard...a n-n-necromancer. I feel that he m-m-m-may be able to help...yes, help.
11563 : And so I m-m-m-must ask upon you once m-m-m-more, if I m-m-m-may...or m-m-m-may not... Um...oh... C-can you assist m-m-m-me in m-m-m-my quest?
11564 : I would carry out this task m-m-m-myself if I could, but as I told you before, m-m-m-my eyesight is failing and it w-won't be long before I am f-forced to reside in an abyss of d-despair.
11565 : Y-yes, I know such n-nefarious doings are considered b-blasphemy and are outlawed by the followers of Altana. However, that no longer t-troubles m-m-m-me. I removed the Goddess from m-m-m-my life the m-m-m-moment she pushed m-m-m-me from hers.
11566 : I beg of you... Let a poor m-m-m-man see the s-smiling face of his b-beloved, one last time...
11567 : A necromancer in the aqueducts? Why, of whatever do you... Wait one moment. Perhaps you speak of the queer fellow that hides in the shadows of the shadows, deep within those accursed tunnels?
11568 : Yes, I have heard tales of a powerful mage, last in the line of a family of great Tavnazian wizards. So powerful, in fact, that even the Windurstian warlocks kept their distance.
11569 : However, after the Great War and the loss of his family, he retreated to the aqueducts where it is said he began delving in the dark arts.
11570 : Not much more is known about him. Not even his age. Some say he may be over two hundred years old...
11571 : Anyway, you may try searching for him, but I do not believe you will have much luck. The wizard does not appreciate company, disappearing at the approach of any unwelcome soul.
11572 : Justinius knows of his presence in the aqueducts, but has yet to take any action.
11573 : 'Tis better we leave the man to himself, he says.
11574 : I know not the reason you seek out this mage, but recommend that you heed Justinius's warnings and keep your distance.
11575 : Hey, %!
11576 : Have you heard? The wyrms that were circling above Tavnazia have disappeared.
11577 : It's all over. The town has finally found peace again.
11578 : I haven't seen Miss Mildaurion for a while, but she did send a messenger. Looks like Jeuno is willing to continue supporting the safehold.
11579 : Unlike Nag'molada's flimsy promises, with this arrangement we'll be able to govern ourselves.
11580 : I have never seen Granpere so excited. He plans to hire adventurers to exterminate all the fiends, and then sow fields in Lufaise and Misareaux.
11581 : He also intends to restore the shepherd villages on Cape Riverne, although a great deal of the land yet floats high above the sea in that unnatural way...
11582 : Once the people of Tavnazia have regained their strength and spirit, we will rebuild the Marquisate and reclaim our lives.
11583 : No longer shall our homes be overrun by monsters.
11584 : Sure, the dragons are gone, but we've still got a lot of work to do.
11585 : And don't you give me that sympathetic look. You adventurers will have plenty of opportunities to pitch in.
11586 : You must not give in to the lure of battle, Prishe.
11587 : We need you to focus on becoming the leader of the Tavnazian Cathedral.
11588 : Wha--!? I'm off to get my workout!
11589 : Later!
11590 : Prishe...!
11591 : When I dwell on events, it seems we have done nothing but cause you trouble.
11592 : And yet you have stood by us through it all. We are truly grateful.
11593 : And should the opportunity arise, we would greatly appreciate any further assistance you could provide for the Marquisate.
11594 : However... I understand that as an adventurer, there is still much in the world you wish to experience.
11595 : If you ever feel the need to rest your wings, we will always welcome you here in Tavnazia.
11596 : I hope we may meet again, %.
11597 : Hey, you found me!
11598 : Have you been here before, %? You can see for malms.
11599 : You can get a great view of the town where I was born--where the end of the world was born.
11600 : All I've ever thought about is what the apocalypse would be like.
11601 : If I manage to live out this eternal life, I guess I'll eventually find out.
11602 : It doesn't matter how--the rebirth of Promathia; the awakening of the sleeping gods; the victory of the beastmen.
11603 : The world will end. And when that happens, even my immortal existence will be snuffed out.
11604 : When I stood before that gate, Promathia promised to show me the apocalypse.
11605 : That was when I realized who most wanted to see the end of it all--who couldn't wait for the grand finale.
11606 : That person was me.
11607 : That's why I hurled that black magicite into the Twilight God.
11608 : I somehow hoped that by sending it into the mothercrystal with the soul of Promathia, the Keeper of the Apocalypse would one day rise again.
11609 : Miss Mildaurion didn't yell at me.
11610 : She just smiled and said, Wait until you meet [him/her].
11611 : What did she mean? Is your hatred of me meant to be my punishment?
11612 : Do you think so? Nod. Shake your head.
11613 : I thought so. That must be why I hurt inside.
11614 : No, really. That must be why I hurt inside.
11615 : Why now? I've been the target of a lot of abuse over the years, and it's never bothered me.
11616 : But for some reason, you just standing there quietly is more than I can bear.
11617 : And it's not like being kicked, or punched, or stabbed.
11618 : I can't get a handle on it. It's frightening and unnerving. I feel like I'm gonna be sick.
11619 : You're just a mortal, right?
11620 : Then how can you close your heart off to me?
11621 : Are you sad? Do I make you sad?
11622 : Is it too difficult? Am I too difficult to deal with?
11623 : Don't you want to open your heart to me?
11624 : What the hell is this feeling? What the hell is going on...?
11625 : You and I feel the same way. That's why I can't read you. We share the same soul.
11626 : No, it's not that I can't read you, it's because I've become the same as you...
11627 : The magicite in my chest... It's gone...
11628 : Has my magicite...melted away...?
11629 : I know what's happened... I've gotten it back...
11630 : The thing that makes us mortal... The Emptiness...
11631 : I'm mortal again. That's why I feel so much pain.
11632 : ...Damn. Being mortal sure is complicated.
11633 : I'm in pain, but I'm happy.
11634 : It hurts, but I can smile.
11635 : That's why I can tell you from the depths of my being...
11636 : Thank you, %.
11637 : I can go on now.
11638 : Not simply wait for the end, but be just like everyone else...
11639 : ...and truly live.
11640 : Why!? Why why why why why!?
11641 : I don't get it! No, I don't! I don't don't don't don't don't!!!
11642 : ...Calm down.
11643 : You meanie! Just whose faultaru is this, anyway!? Even though I told you a million-gazillion times to keep it safe!
11644 : I'm sorry. But still, we were there at the exact time it said on the letter the thief wrote, and we kept such a close watch on the place you told us to guard that not so much as a mouse could sneak by!
11645 : The thief never showed up, but even so...the % is gone.
11646 : How could it have happened? We've been racking our brains for answers and nothing comes to mind!
11647 : Eep! Oh... Ohhh... Hmm... Really...? But still... Hmph...
11648 : Nope, I don't get it! I don't! I don't! I don't! Hmph!
11649 : That's why I was wondering if you knew something else about it.
11650 : No! Nothing! I just want my treasure-weasure back! Just give it back to me! I want it!
11651 : I don't know what we can do. This is the first time anything like this has ever happened here.
11652 : This has to be the work of some dirty-dastardly fiend! No one from Tavnazia has ever done such a thing. No, they haven't!
11653 : ...It seems that the culprit comes from foreign shores. Isn't that right, %?
11654 : Mengrenaux! Shut your trap! It's not like [he/she]'s the only person in town from another land!
11655 : Exactly! I saw another traveler myself just the other day, and he was quite noticeable, as well. I rather liked him, though. He seemed fairly outgoing.
11656 : This is why we're in this mess! Because you guys are so naive! Now get out there and catch me that thief!!!
11657 : %, think you could gather some information for us? I'm sure you don't like being ridiculed just because you're not from around here, do you?
11658 : I want you to report your findings to me. A brave adventurer like you should have no trouble with a puny task like this. After you finish, we can start looking for the criminal.
11659 : Please find as much information as you can. We can worry about finding the culprit afterwards.
11660 : Read the thief's letter? Let me at it! A thief? Too scary...
11661 : I'm coming for your treasure at midnight tonight. -Miledo-Shiraddo, Thief Extraordinaire
11662 : We'll collect information too. I won't let an outsider like you take all the glory.
11663 : Collecting information is the next step, is it not? I do not know if I can be of help, but I will do what I can!
11664 : Tell you about a suspicious traveler, you say? I remember him clearly...
11665 : I have not seen him lately, though. Sometimes people just wash up here, but he looked like he was here for a specific purpose.
11666 : He would stand on the bridge for hours just staring at the town. I was surprised he did not seem to ever get bored of it. He definitely showed a lot of interest in this place.
11667 : That is all I know.
11668 : A suspicious traveler? ...Who could forget a face like that?
11669 : I saw him by the Altar of the Dawn in the middle of the night. I remember thinking it was a strange time for him to be out wandering around.
11670 : He kept looking at it from different angles. He was also walking back and forth to see the altar from different distances.
11671 : That's all I know.
11672 : I have no time to give to petty patrol business! ...You say you seek a suspicious traveler? I happen to have seen one, but I hope you make this worth my time.
11673 : I kept seeing him over there.
11674 : I was thinking what a cute, plump little boy he was when he noticed my stare and waved to me.
11675 : When I waved back to him, he looked so happy. He even waved to everyone in the Tavnazian Patrol.
11676 : That is all I know.
11677 : A trabuh-veler? Yeah! I saw one!
11678 : I saw him from here! He jumped into the water! I wanted to go in the water too!
11679 : I wonder what he was doing. I never knew adventurererers went swimming. I've never done it before!
11680 : That's all I know.
11681 : Hello! How have you been?
11682 : As for me, lately life is a breeze! Thanks to the burglar, Wazozo is too busy to gripe!
11683 : You should have caught a glimpse of her face when she was reading the letter from the thief. I have never seen her so mad. Her face was as red as a strawberry!
11684 : This is just between us, but I think there is more to that altar than meets the eye.
11685 : Why, the other day, I saw Wazozo rustling suspiciously around it...
11686 : She seemed to be trying to give the thing a good scrub-down. It must have been the first time I had ever seen her do something that was not self-serving!
11687 : No, there must be some other reason. There is definitely something more to her suspicious actions.
11688 : Hey, guess what!?
11689 : I saw her there! Staring at the water! I saw Wazozo! She was there, and I really saw her!
11690 : She always said she hated such creepy places! But she was there! It's sooo weird!
11691 : Nobody believes me, though.
11692 : When you associate yourself with people like Wazozo, you get nothing but grief. I have never met such a spoiled brat!
11693 : That is why I was surprised to see her asking the Tavnazian Patrol so nicely to guard the altar after receiving the thief's letter.
11694 : She is always so brash and obnoxious, but when I saw her with the patrol, she was completely different. She was almost...polite.
11695 : The world is just full of mysteries, is it not?
11696 : Are you finished collecting information? Yes. I need more time.
11697 : I see... I think we need a little more than this, though. Don't you have anything else?
11698 : Oh? Hmmm... Well, sorry, but you did offer to help! Someone in this town must know something.
11699 : I see you've gathered quite a bit of information there! We can really use this!
11700 : Tell me! Tell me now! Who did it? Who stole my treasure!?
11701 : Don't have a hissy-fit.
11702 : Judging by the look in your eyes, it seems you've figured out what happened.
11703 : I've been wondering myself what happened during our watch.
11704 : Who cares about that!? Where is the %!? It's mine!!!
11705 : You know, I would think someone as old as you would understand the need for a little something called order in our investigation...
11706 : (The witch! How dare she insinuataru that I'm some bird-brainless fogy!)
11707 : %, do you think you could put the information you've collected in order for us?
11708 : Whose part of the story came first? Fouagine. Zadant. Noam. Raminey.
11709 : Whose part of the story came second? Let me think a bit. Zadant. Noam. Raminey.
11710 : Whose part of the story came second? Let me think a bit. Fouagine. Noam. Raminey.
11711 : Whose part of the story came second? Let me think a bit. Fouagine. Zadant. Raminey.
11712 : Whose part of the story came second? Let me think a bit. Fouagine. Zadant. Noam.
11713 : Whose part of the story came third? Let me think a bit. Noam. Raminey.
11714 : Whose part of the story came third? Let me think a bit. Zadant. Raminey.
11715 : Whose part of the story came third? Let me think a bit. Fouagine. Raminey.
11716 : Whose part of the story came third? Let me think a bit. Zadant. Noam.
11717 : Whose part of the story came third? Let me think a bit. Fouagine. Noam.
11718 : Whose part of the story came third? Let me think a bit. Fouagine. Zadant.
11719 : So Fouagine's was last, right? Let me think a bit. That's right!
11720 : So Zadant's was last, right? Let me think a bit. That's right!
11721 : So Noam's was last, right? Let me think a bit. That's right!
11722 : So Raminey's was last, right? Let me think a bit. That's right!
11723 : All right then.
11724 : Well, we can't tell anything from that.
11725 : I see... Really? So that means... No, we can't know for sure yet, but this tells us quite a bit...
11726 : Put together with the findings of the Tavnazian Patrol, we might be able to make some sense of what actually happened. Then again, there is another problem...
11727 : These two can't even remember their witnesses' locations! Not a work ethic fit for the Tavnazian Patrol, is it?
11728 : We are sorry!
11729 : Very sorry!
11730 : Both of you, show me the data you have gathered. %, could you find out where each piece of information was collected?
11731 : Take a look at my reports? Report 1. Report 2. Not interested.
11732 : Well then, good luck.
11733 : Take a look at my reports? Report 3. Report 4. Not interested.
11734 : Okay, I will leave it to you, then!
11735 : So, did you figure out where each person was when they witnessed a suspicious act? If you know, please tell us.
11736 : Where did the events in Report 1 occur? <I-8>. <H-8>. <J-7>. <G-9>.
11737 : Where did the events in Report 2 occur? <I-8>. <H-8>. <J-7>. <G-9>.
11738 : Where did the events in Report 3 occur? <I-8>. <H-8>. <J-7>. <G-9>.
11739 : Where did the events in Report 4 occur? <I-8>. <H-8>. <J-7>. <G-9>.
11740 : Hmmm...
11741 : Now we know where the thief is!
11742 : Where is he!? Lock him away! Lock him awaaay!!!
11743 : According to eyewitnesses, the criminal was seen rummaging about in the tributary, totally soaked. If we follow the water trail from there...
11744 : ...We can catch the thief!
11745 : But why would he be in the tributary?
11746 : Ulp!
11747 : No matter how I look at it, there still seems to be something missing.
11748 : %, do you think you could go to the tributary and follow the criminal's trail? We will stay here and try to find out why the thief was there in the first place.
11749 : It is quite a coincidence that both Wazozo and the suspicious boy were seen in the same places.
11750 : They must have been up to some mischief in the tributary. I have a feeling that knowing their doings would be rather significant to our investigation.
11751 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
11752 : There is a % lying on the ground here! % obtains the %!
11753 : There is a trail of water here. It is still fresh.
11754 : It seems the water trail ends here.
11755 : What!? There's no thief here!!!
11756 : The % was lying on the ground!? Show it to me!
11757 : You really found it!? Yes, yes! Give it back to me!!!
11758 : This is terrible...
11759 : Wazozo, I'm sorry, but the vessel is shattered.
11760 : Wh-wh-wh-wh-WHAAAT!?!?
11761 : It was not very sturdy, was it?
11762 : Eh? There's something on the ground.
11763 : This looks like...a letter!?
11764 : What is it? Show me.
11765 : What's this? I got the gold just like I promised. -Miledo-Shiraddo
11766 : !!!
11767 : Gold? You've got some explaining to do, Wazozo.
11768 : Ummm... Eheheheh...
11769 : That is strange. So the thief wasn't after the % after all?
11770 : Hm... The tributary... The % in pieces... A message saying that gold was stolen...
11771 : No matter how I look at it, I can't help but think that the % was not at the altar, but was rather hidden in the tributary! And it contained a chunk of gold!!!
11772 : Isn't that right, Wazozo?
11773 : Hmmm, whatever could you be talking aboutaru? I have no idea what you mean...
11774 : Wait a moment! You made us guard the altar even though there was nothing there!?
11775 : Let's investigate a bit more, shall we? I'm sure it'll all be made clear soon.
11776 : W-wait a minute! Just what do you think you're doing? I-I told you I don'taru know anything!
11777 : Ha! You couldn't catch me in a million-billion years!
11778 : Ta-taru!
11779 : Hey, thanks a lot for all you've done for us.
11780 : We put Wazozo to the question, and she eventually confessed to getting hold of a chunk of gold.
11781 : Oh yeah, I should give you something for your efforts. I've already informed Ondieulix of your deeds, so just talk to him for your reward.
11782 : We're still tailing Miledo-Shiraddo. If you happen to see him around, please inform us.
11783 : Maybe I was a little too sharp with Wazozo...
11784 : To tell the truth, I'm a closet fan of Miledo-Shiraddo... I'd love to have adventures like that too...
11785 : I heard of your deeds from Tressia. Here is your reward.
11786 : We may need your help again someday. Thank you, %.
11787 : You return the %.
11788 : What could those villains be up to...?
11789 : Oh, it's you, %. I was just recalling my investigation at Monarch Linn. Unknown attackers set upon me, though their garb did remind me of Nag'molada...
11790 : What's this!? You have experienced a similar attack!? Those men refuse to listen to reason!
11791 : They seem to have an unusual interest in the area--always creeping about like faceless shadows, the cowls of their black robes hiding their features.
11792 : I spotted them during my patrol the other day, but they attacked me before I even had the chance to ask their business.
11793 : I was wondering what to do about them, but it seems the solution is standing right in front of me. I want you to keep those men away from Monarch Linn. They are obstructing my patrols.
11794 : Take up this duty? On my way. Not today.
11795 : Excellent. Take this and make your way to Monarch Linn. You may have fought them before, but be careful. Who knows what tricks they have hiding up their sleeves?
11796 : Lost your will for battle, hm? There might be another way to deal with this, but let me know if you change your mind. It would make my job a lot easier.
11797 : Take the % and head for Monarch Linn. You may have fought them before, but be careful. Who knows what tricks they have hiding up their sleeves?
11798 : You failed to oust the intruders from Monarch Linn!? And you lost the % into the bargain...!?
11799 : It will take some time to have another permit approved. You may as well return to your adventures for a while. (This is what I deserve for trusting an adventurer...)
11800 : A new % has been approved. Perhaps this time you'll be properly prepared for the challenge that awaits!
11801 : So, you have routed those black-robed menaces from Monarch Linn? Excellent news.
11802 : Your reward--for a job well done. Go on, take it. You deserve something for putting your neck on the line.
11803 : We cannot know if these intruders are gone for good, however. I will continue my surveillance of the area, but would appreciate it if you checked in with me again in the near future.
11804 : Do you remember those black-robed intruders you chased away from Monarch Linn? We've had another sighting. Do you think you could go and persuade them to leave again?
11805 : Excellent! Here is your patrol permit. Stay on your guard.
11806 : Fair enough. I'll start work on another plan, but let me know if you change your mind. I have other duties that require my attention.
11807 : Number of Mammets: # Table Number: [A/B/C/D] Random Value: # / 0-99 Miratete Claim: [No/Yes]
11808 : Ah, %. %... There was something I was supposed to tell you...
11809 : Ah, yes! I have a letter for you.
11810 : It is always nice to receive word from a loved one, is it not? Why, I remember when I used to have regular correspondence with a friend of mine in Selbina...
11811 : Ah, %. Another letter has arrived for you. Why they should be delivered to me is quite the mystery, however...
11812 : Here it is. A love letter from a secret admirer, mayhap? Please forgive an old man's prying; my curiosity tends to get the better of me at times.
11813 : What? Yes? Could you please not...talk to me?
11814 : Yes? What? If you are not acquainted with Yurim, then I'm not interested in talking with you. Good day.
11815 : What have you given to Yurim?
11816 : Biolumin matter? I don't quite... Are you making fun of me?
11817 : Well. Yes. Maybe you could bring me some of this biolumin matter. I'm quite wealthy and willing to reward you.
11818 : That snake Yurim! How dare she employ complete strangers to aid in her research! I will not be upstaged!
11819 : Bring me some of this biolumin matter. In any shape, color, or size. Quickly, now.
11820 : Did you bring me something containing biolumin matter? You do realize I have absolutely no interest in engaging you in small talk?
11821 : %... So this is the matter that Yurim has been babbling about.
11822 : Yes. Now. How do I present this to Yurim and gain my own...? Hmmm.
11823 : Are you still here? Ah, of course. Your reward. Be sure to bring any more samples you find directly to me.
11824 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Bring forth the %...

11840 : % and % cannot be used here.
11841 : %... Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to. The time left to me is short.
11842 : Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...
11843 : I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me... It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...
11844 : Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.
11845 : A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.
11846 : My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully. Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.
11847 : Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world. You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete. My hopes go with you, %.
11848 : There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.
11849 : There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.
11850 : The strands of grass here have been tied together.
11851 : There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.
11852 : I see you have met with Raogrimm. His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.
11853 : In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.
11854 : You will need the %, a key that bridges the void between Vana'diel and that other world.
11855 : It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The % is one of those items.
11856 : You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the %. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...
11857 : That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.
11858 : Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.
11859 : The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.
11860 : We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.
11861 : Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the % to guide you...
11862 : I never believed that my indifference to the state of other nations would cause harm to my beloved San d'Oria...
11863 : As part of my penance, I will infuse the % with what guidance I can.
11864 : I betrayed him... And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...
11865 : Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...
11866 : I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
11867 : Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.
11868 : Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord... This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.
11869 : Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
11870 : Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.
11871 : I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.
11872 : Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.
11873 : Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this %! Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
11874 : There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.
11875 : There is a symbol carved into the rock here.
11876 : I have been waiting for you.
11877 : Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"... Do you understand the significance of these words?
11878 : When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form... Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.
11879 : Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...
11880 : The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.
11881 : Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard.  The next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.
11882 : You must obtain the last trophy. All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.
11883 : Take care, my brave adventurer. May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
11884 : Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning. This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.
11885 : I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death. Is this what they call karma...?
11886 : This land has borne the weight of my sins. I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...
11887 : So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed... Keep your wits aboutaru you, %.
11888 : I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes. Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.
11889 : It is time! Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, %. %! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
11890 : Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a prison of souls.
11891 : Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened. Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...
11892 : It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?
11893 : There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.
11894 : Please pay no mind to my ramblings. You have secured the %. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.
11895 : You will need four such trophies. Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.
11896 : I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...
11897 : Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.
11898 : It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities. If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...
11899 : %. This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.
11900 : When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there. That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.
11901 : What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge. But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...
11902 : That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...
11903 : Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry! I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.
11904 : Now, %. This % is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.
11905 : Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, %. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...
11906 : The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.
11907 : I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.
11908 : Wait, wait, wait! I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but... How can I explain it?
11909 : Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.
11910 : But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order! You've got your paws on the %! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.
11911 : But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.
11912 : % and the four trophies. These artifacts have long been lost to that other world.  The Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.
11913 : It must have been in the time of the Great War... Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.
11914 : Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.
11915 : The % and the %. Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms. Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...
11916 : Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way. However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...
11917 : Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...
11918 : Is it over...?
11919 : No, the rage has merely been dispersed.
11920 : As long as I exist, he will never truly die...
11921 : Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?
11922 : %... You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented. I have not the words to express my gratitude.
11923 : The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more. I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...
11924 : The one who holds sway...?
11925 : Yes. From the center of infinite darkness. I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...
11926 : You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell. The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.
11927 : It was an error in judgment to shelter you... The order of my realm has been disrupted.
11928 : I give to you a duty... You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.
11929 : No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul. No return to the land of blessed light...
11930 : What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness? As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.
11931 : Of one thing I was certain. This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.
11932 : A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.
11933 : Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow. It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.
11934 : Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey. Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.
11935 : %, you may be the one to witness this truth.
11936 : The power stored in the % will soon be drained. And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.
11937 : Do not forget who you are, %. I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.
11938 : My old companions...?
11939 : This duty is too much for just one to bear. If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived. It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.
11940 : That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.
11941 : Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis? I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.
11942 : Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm. I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.
11943 : C'mon, let's see a little excitement! This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.
11944 : It's not the Northlands this time. None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?
11945 : I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain. Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.
11946 : I thought this would be the end of you for sure... Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.
11947 : What, no words for an old friend? Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?
11948 : I betrayed you! I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia! The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!
11949 : Everything began thirty years ago. And there were things that came to an end... Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.
11950 : And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.
11951 : I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions. No matter who that person may be.
11952 : Raogrimm...
11953 : Are you sure you want to do this? This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land. As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...
11954 : Raogrimm. There is no need to suffer alone anymore. Our presence here should answer your question.
11955 : There are crimes that must be atoned for. And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.
11956 : Until the dawn of an age without hatred... No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.
11957 : Cornelia...
11960 : There is a strange symbol drawn here. A haunting chill sweeps through you as you gaze upon it...
11961 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Present the %...if you wish to pass into...my dream.
11962 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: The sands of time yet fall... Present the...%.
11963 : I am the ruler of Dynamis.
11964 : Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs? Either way, this is not your dream.
11965 : The dreamer of this realm is a separate entity than he who dreamt of that wasteland of malice, Xarcabard.
11966 : Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?
11967 : I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.
11968 : While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.
11969 : The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.
11970 : Search for my counterpart, and unite this realm with your own dream.
11971 : A nightmare curses this land yet again.
11972 : Take heed, dream traveler.
11973 : I have been watching your dream.
11974 : But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there. This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.
11975 : You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.
11976 : I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...
11977 : The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.
11978 : Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place... The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.
11979 : The entrance to the dream has already been opened. Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.
11980 : I am...a unique entity...
11981 : We are...comprised of all entities...
11982 : Intermingling with one another...dividing among each other...
11983 : And devouring one another...
11984 : The shadow that you defeated had been consumed by the dreamer of this realm.
11985 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who have come into contact with the Emptiness.
11986 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who came into contact with the Emptiness.
11987 : Could it have been that girl...? When I next see her, she will pay dearly.
11988 : Could it have been that girl...? No, there was one more, transformed after death...
11989 : Her malice will not perish as long as this dream continues, using my shadows to revive countless times.
11990 : You must confront the nightmare and continue to fight them to keep this realm from spreading.
11991 : The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness... Could it have been transferred to another girl...?
11992 : You know this girl well. I could take care of her easily, but if you wish me to spare her, then you will lend me your power.
11993 : Trade the % to the Hieroglyphics found in each area. The % will be transformed into %.

12030 : Who...? Ah, it's you, %. I never know when one of you adventurers will choose to darken my doorstep.
12031 : It may not be my place to say it, but Prishe seemed upset with you.
12032 : You see, I found this unusual ring on one of my patrols. When I showed it to Prishe and Ulmia, they were certain it was the same ring they gave to you.
12033 : Poor Ulmia seemed on the verge of tears. Is this how you treat a person's heartfelt gift!?
12034 : It might be nothing more than a bauble to you, but for those girls it was a symbol of your friendship--your unbreakable bond!
12035 : Here, take it. Maybe this time you'll think twice about how much it's really worth...
12036 : Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
12037 : I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain %.
12038 : Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
12039 : May I be of service? Not now. Learn recipes. Check fewell. Replenish fewell. Purchase materials. Receive training. Trade cinder. Get information.
12040 : Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
12041 : ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
12042 : I've got it! How about %? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...
12043 : Synergy skill: [Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice/Journeyman/Craftsman/Artisan/Adept/Veteran].

12061 : There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
12062 : But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your % for a moment...
12063 : Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: # # # # # # # #.
12064 : Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
12065 : Replenish fewell? Yes. No.
12066 : Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
12067 : ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
12068 : Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for # gil.  How does that sound?
12069 : Pay # gil? Deal! No thanks.
12070 : Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
12071 : I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
12072 : Excellent! Now we just pop open your % here, and...
12073 : There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
12074 : Your % has been filled to capacity!
12075 : You hand the synergy engineer # gil.
12076 : How do you expect me to do that when your % is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
12077 : Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
12078 : Purchase something? Not today. # %: # gil. # ): # gil. # ): # gil.
12079 : For # %, that comes to # gil.
12080 : Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
12081 : ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
12082 : And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
12083 : Train in which technique? Cancel. Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: #) Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: #) Safety lever. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: #) Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: #)
12084 : You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
12085 : It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
12086 : Train in this technique? Yes. No.
12087 : Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
12088 : ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
12089 : ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
12090 : ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
12091 : <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
12092 : ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
12093 : Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level #!
12094 : Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
12095 : Trade in your cinder? (Currently: # Pz) Not now. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. # gil: # Pz.
12096 : This is what you want, correct?
12097 : Make the exchange? Yes. No.
12098 : It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
12099 : Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
12100 : You transferred # Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. # Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
12101 : Ask about what? Nothing. Synergy furnaces. Synergy overview. Synergy procedure. Synergy recipes. Fewell replenishment. Materials for sale. Synergy techniques. Trading cinder.
12102 : The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
12103 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
12104 : Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
12105 : Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
12106 : You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
12107 : Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
12108 : This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call fewell. To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
12109 : As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
12110 : With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
12111 : The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
12112 : But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
12113 : If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
12114 : Take heart, though, as any materials inside your % will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
12115 : Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
12116 : Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
12117 : Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
12118 : You may be asking yourself, Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?
12119 : Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
12120 : The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
12121 : Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of %, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
12122 : Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that % may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
12123 : Mind you, % is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
12124 : Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
12125 : First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
12126 : You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
12127 : Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
12128 : You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
12129 : From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
12130 : Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
12131 : Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
12132 : However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
12133 : If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
12134 : You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
12135 : The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
12136 : It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
12137 : This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
12138 : As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
12139 : For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
12140 : You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
12141 : In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
12142 : Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
12143 : If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
12144 : Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
12145 : What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
12146 : The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
12147 : ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
12148 : Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
12149 : Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
12150 : Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
12151 : The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
12152 : In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as % can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
12153 : % cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of % can then be embedded.
12154 : The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
12155 : If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
12156 : As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
12157 : You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
12158 : Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
12159 : My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
12160 : The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
12161 : Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
12162 : To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
12163 : When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
12164 : Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
12165 : Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
12166 : As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call fewell. The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
12167 : Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
12168 : To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
12169 : For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
12170 : That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your %! What could be easier?
12171 : Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of %? If so, you've come to the right place!
12172 : We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
12173 : Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
12174 : Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
12175 : Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
12176 : My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
12177 : Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
12178 : Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
12179 : Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
12180 : The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
12181 : Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
12182 : Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
12183 : We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
12184 : It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
12185 : Wondering if your % can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
12186 : A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
12187 : Congratulations! Your % can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A %-shaped aperture, to be exact...
12188 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: # / [///////].
12189 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
12190 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
12191 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
12192 : That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
12193 : Hmm... I'm afraid your % cannot house any more apertures.
12194 : ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your % cannot be etched.
12195 : Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your % cannot be etched at this time.
12196 : Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

12200 : Oh, the %? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
12201 : Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
12202 : Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
12203 : Learn about synergy? Not today. Teach me! Just give me %.
12204 : A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
12205 : I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
12206 : Using % in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
12207 : What we call % serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
12208 : Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
12209 : Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your % into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
12210 : Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
12211 : Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
12212 : You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
12213 : But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
12214 : A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
12215 : That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
12216 : An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for %, you've certainly come to the right place.
12217 : I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for # gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
12218 : # gil, paid in full!
12219 : As promised, here's your %. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
12220 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
12221 : Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
12222 : Ah, %. You have chosen a most opportune time to pay visit.
12223 : Ah, an adventurer, if I am not mistaken. You have chosen a most opportune time to pay visit.
12224 : I was in the midst of preparing a letter to send to the moogles, but it seems that will be unnecessary as you yourself have come to us.
12225 : Might I trouble you to accept the letter, that folk residing on the mainland would know that Tavnazia shares in their joy?
12226 : Through you, I have great confidence that a great many adventurers will come to know of our sentiments.
12227 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
12228 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
12229 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
12230 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
12231 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
12232 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
12233 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
12234 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
12235 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
12236 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
12237 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
12238 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
12239 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
12240 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
12241 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
12242 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
12243 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
12244 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
12245 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
12246 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
12247 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!

12302 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
12303 : The atmacite could not be purged...
12304 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
12305 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
12306 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
12307 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
12308 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
12309 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
12310 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
12311 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
12312 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
12313 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
12314 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
12315 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
12316 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
12317 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
12318 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
12319 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12320 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
12321 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
12322 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
12323 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
12324 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
12325 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
12326 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
12327 : Your % has evolved into %!
12328 : Supply me with the # cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.

13063 : I've been dispatched from many malms away on a very important mission.
13064 : What might that objective be, you ask? One as heroically challenged as you need not concern yourself with it.
13065 : I've been dispatched from many malms away on a very important mission. What sort of mission, you ask? An astute question indeed! And here I'd begun to lose hope of meeting any capable adventurers in these provincial backwaters.
13066 : (Shhh! Not so loud!)
13067 : (Yes, I hail from Jeuno, but we can't let the riffraff around these parts be privy to that information.)
13068 : What exactly is my objective? Oh, come now. I'm certain [a hero/a heroine] of your caliber could figure it out. The secrecy, the mention of <cough> Jeuno <cough>, propositioning adventurers...
13069 : Yes, it does indeed involve Voidwalkers--those eerie menaces that traverse time and space by way of those planar rifts. I haven't the foggiest idea as to why, but they've apparently decided to make Tavnazia their next battlefront.
13070 : I was given an order to dispose of the threat, effective immediately. However, these fishmongering philistines...how do I put this politely? Show no respect for the Voidwatch's jurisdiction.
13071 : No matter how civil I try to be around these country bumpkins, they simply won't let me do my job. Thus I've been secretly recruiting adventurers to aid in our cause.
13072 : What say you take pity on a fellow crusader of justice and help rid this wasteland of its interdimensional intruders?
13073 : Oh, so you're %? I've heard much about you from Justinius.
13074 : One of those being that your exploits factored heavily in Jeuno's decision to trade with this region.
13075 : In that sense, one could say it's your doing--for better or worse--that I've been dispatched to this goddess-forsaken crag.
13076 : I have a proposition, but I warn you--this task is more harrowing than listening to your mother-in-law berate you over a deceptively cordial cup of tea about how you don't spend enough time with your wife. Even now, I can see her eyes...bearing into my soul...as her venomous tongue paralyzes me like a death jacket's stinger. Die! Die, you accursed fiend!
13077 : But I digress. This mission actually involves Voidwalkers. According to the Tavnazian Patrol, planar rifts have been opening up across the archipelago recently.
13078 : What they see in this piddling swath of scattered rocks, I haven't a clue.
13079 : (Still, if they can find a mound of rubble like Tavnazia habitable, what's stopping them from infesting every area in the realm?)
13080 : In summation, we need your assistance in exterminating these pests.
13081 : What do you say? Will you do your part for the Voidwatch?
13082 : What will you do? Nothing at all. Ask many a question. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
13083 : I see... It would seem everyone in these parts is a lily-livered craven. It must be something in the water...
13084 : Whoa, whoa, whoa! There's something I need to get off my chest. I figured no one in this dirthole would be brave enough to sign up, so I didn't bother reading the recruitment manual.
13085 : It pains me to admit my own ignorance, but you'll have to seek out a Voidwatch Officer if you want some answers.
13086 : Did you finally grow a backbone? Now are you ready to join the Voidwatch and make the realm proud?
13087 : People say I sound like a pompous jackanapes, but at least I know how to give thanks. Your help will be more than welcome in the Uleguerand Range, Lufaise Meadows, Attohwa Chasm, and on the Misareaux Coast.
13088 : You'll need this % for your operations as well. Take it. Don't hold back on my account.
13089 : However, this won't be of much use unless you're also in possession of %...or so my superiors tell me. Very well then. May you save the realm and one day depart this bastion of boors.
13090 : Remember, you can always come to me for help should backcountry life prove too stressful. If nothing else, we can always bemoan our terrible fates together.
13091 : You have yet to complete all of your objectives. Proceed to [Lufaise Meadows/Misareaux Coast/Uleguerand Range/Attohwa Chasm][, Misareaux Coast/, Uleguerand Range/, Attohwa Chasm/ for your final task./][, Uleguerand Range/, Attohwa Chasm/, Misareaux Coast/][, and Attohwa Chasm.//Victory is nearly in our grasp!/, and...yes, that is all.] I wish you the best of luck.
13092 : Voidwalkers have reappeared at Lufaise Meadows, Misareaux Coast, Uleguerand Range, [and Attohwa Chasm/Attohwa Chasm, and Bibiki Bay]. Keep your chin up! With your help, we'll put an end to this Voidwalker invasion yet! ...I hope.
13093 : My compatriots within the 'Watch tell me that you've exterminated every last threat to the archipelago. Admirably done.
13094 : ...But we both know the old adage about assuming. Only greenhorns and village idiots fail to realize that these creatures possess an uncanny ability to revive as if they'd never suffered a scratch. If only we could decipher the manner in which they cheat death...
13095 : Stay that thought... If Voidwalkers can resurrect...then my mission will never end! I don't want to be trapped on this isolated archipelago for eternity! What will my hydrangeas ever do without me!?
13096 : ...Wait, I have an idea! You know what might turn the tide of this fathomless bloodbath? A war of attrition! If you could return every so often to slay these undying anomalies, we might yet be able to terminate the Voidwalkers once and for all!
13097 : Were you aware that the inhabitants of this land finally decided to open trade with Jeuno?
13098 : Though I often speak ill of them, truth is the locals are rather open-minded and accepting, though a tad unsophisticated.
13099 : Even Justinius of the Tavnazia Patrol has proven quite cooperative.
13100 : Speaking of Justinius, it would behoove us to inform him of your victories.
13101 : You're a credit to adventurers everywhere. Justinius certainly knows a capable [man/woman] when he sees one. Speaking of Justinius, it would behoove us to inform him of your victories.
13102 : I'll tell you where I'll put my hooves if you're gonna keep secrets from me!
13103 : I knew you could do it, %! No one can come close to matching your awesomeness!
13104 : Misareaux mantraps! Who might you be!?
13105 : I see you're at it again, %. We all know how powerful you are, so how about throwing the patrol a bone every once in a while? We're dying for some good press!
13106 : Justinius has told me all about your exploits. You're always there for Tavnazia when it needs you, %. Thanks.
13107 : Although, I guess it should only be a matter of time before we get our due, what with all the Voidwalkers crawling around Tavnazia lately.
13108 : But Voidwalkers tend to reappear like maggots on meat, right?
13109 : Just you wait! We'll cut down so many of those mystical invaders that...well, there won't be any left for you!
13110 : Maybe this's the Tavnazian Patrol's chance to get some good press of our own!
13111 : Prishe! This is hardly the time to be engaging in idle chatter! Your studies await!
13112 : Yikes! For crying out loud, Ulmia, you've become more of a curmudgeon than Despachiaire!
13113 : Ulmia!
13114 : Anyway, %, I'll see you later!
13115 : I guess I've been corralled... See you around.
13116 : That girl...
13117 : It's wonderful to see you in such high spirits, %. I always knew in my heart of hearts that we would meet again.
13118 : As you can see, Prishe is as lively as she's ever been.
13119 : Who knows where she, I, and all of Tavnazia would be without you, %. Please return to visit us again sometime. Preferably after Prishe's lessons are finished.
13120 : ...Well, well, well. I should have known that being an adventurer is about having gil and [dames/beaus] scattered all over the realm.
13121 : ...Phew, what a relief that's over. I've withstood tempest gales with less destructive power than that diminutive rapscallion she tutors.
13122 : That diminutive girl was Prishe, correct? Perhaps all the rumors were all simply...rumors.
13123 : Well, you have my thanks for a job well done. I highly doubt you'll be receiving any accolades from the uncouth citizens of this cesspool, but I shall make sure word of your tremendous deeds reaches Jeuno.
13124 : If you'll permit me to spread some titillating gossip, I do believe that Prishe girl was shouting something along the lines of "Bibiki Bay or bust!" before making a rather exuberant departure.
13125 : Supposedly, this Prishe girl has left the Safehold for Bibiki Bay.
13126 : I would enjoy hearing how she plans to travel all the way to Mindartia, however. Since Bibiki Bay lies on that continent, such sorcery should be nigh impossible!
13127 : The same way you did, you say? Through a chaotically churning portal of such despairing darkness that--
13128 : Don't be ridiculous. No one in their right mind would give a little girl like her access to something so sinister! You'd best return to Mindartia yourself and see a physician before you lose the rest of your marbles. ...And why in the Goddess's name has that % changed!?
13129 : Or even better, you could forget all about this dreary rock and get yourself back to the mainland.
13130 : What was that!? Voidwalkers in Bibiki Bay!? Why am I always the last to hear about these things!? Curse my backwoods assignment, and a pox upon the officers who sent me here!
13131 : Wait...does that Prishe girl intend to help us quell the Voidwalker threat?
13132 : I predict choppy seas ahead if you plan on sailing into the eye of her storm again. May you stay the course and remain unscathed...
13133 : I swear, that pixie is hellsbent on dragging the Tavnazian Patrol through the deepest puddle of mud she can find...
13134 : Take cover!
13135 : I take it no one has divulged anything to the citizenry about the matter in question...?
13136 : That's right, sir.
13137 : For space to just twist and contort like that...such does not sit well with me. We must uncover the truth behind this phenomenon, and quickly.
13138 : Phew, that was close. Those two are part of the Tavnazian Patrol. The unit's recently been making rounds more than just often, which has us 'Watchers on our toes.
13139 : I trust you realize what those two were discussing. You do not? Well, fortunately, I do.
13140 : I have here a report concerning the recent appearance of planar rifts in the Bibiki Bay area. Perhaps they're related to the change in your %?
13141 : Either way, Bibiki Bay's farther away from here than my mother-in-law is from being congenial. There's no possible way I could make that trip without being declared AWOL.
13142 : What!? You felled the feral Voidwalkers at Bibiki Bay!? Let us rejoice!
13143 : (Oh my. I must learn to use my inside voice at times like this.)
13144 : Faux pas aside, if I didn't owe you one before, I certainly do now. Bibiki Bay's outside of my jurisdiction, so if anyone from the watch were to see me there, I'd be detained without a doubt.
13145 : Although now that the Voidwalkers are gone, I should be getting orders to ship out any day now. Please let it be today, please let it be today...
13146 : I can't thank you enough, %. You've done so much to help us--which is infinitely more than that bumbling recruiter has.
13147 : I resent that, Justinius! W-wait a moment. You two know each other?
13148 : Justinius...
13149 : Yet now is hardly the time to rest on our laurels. We still know tragically few details about these creatures, and there's no telling what they're capable of.
13150 : Pardon the intrusion, Captain.
13151 : What is it, Tressia?
13152 : It appears the planar rifts are reforming, sir. At least that's the word I've received from our officers in the field.
13153 : Nooo! Not again!
13154 : Understood. Rally the troops. I will contact Jeuno immediately.
13155 : Yessir!
13156 : But...but...I was supposed to go home! Why does this always happen to me!? <Sigh>
13157 : <Sigh>...They discovered more planar rifts in Bibiki Bay.
13158 : ...Oh, it seems the % I gave you has changed. Maybe that has something to do with those planar rifts. By the way, how do you plan on returning to the mainland?
13159 : Wait, that means I can go home now, right!? Right!? Please tell me I'm right!
13160 : How many would you like? None. Just one. As many as possible!
13161 : Here, as you requested. I simply ask that you make the most of what you've been given.
13162 : Please don't take this the wrong way, but you already possess the maximum allocation of # stones. There is no need to procure more.
13163 : I regret to inform you that our stock has been depleted. The next shipment should arrive in # [minute/minutes] (Earth time).
13164 : Obtained key item: # %!
13165 : Obtained key item: # %!
13166 : You wish to know the current amount of % you possess? According to the books, you have # to your name.
13167 : Exchange for what? (Cruor: #) Nothing right now. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #.
13168 : To obtain %, you must expend # cruor.
13169 : To obtain %, you must expend # cruor.
13170 : Proceed with exchange? (Cruor: #) Yes. No.
13171 : I've had enough of this farce. Please endeavor to find out how much cruor you possess before attempting such exchanges again.
13172 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for %!
13173 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for the %!
13174 : ...I believe you already possess %, and I see no reason to give you another.
13175 : This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.
13176 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.
13177 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.
13178 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.
13179 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.
13180 : A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.
13181 : A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.
13182 : A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
13183 : Voiddust, is it? Then I suppose you'll be needing a voidstone... And here it is.
13184 : Voiddust, is it? Then I suppose you'll be needing a voidstone... And here it is.
13185 : I loathe being the harbinger of bad news, but you can't carry any more voidstones. Please hold on to that voiddust until your supply has been depleted.
13186 : How many do you need? (Cruor: #) None, thank you. One (# cruor). Three (# cruor). Six (# cruor). Nine (# cruor). Twelve (# cruor).
13187 : % obtains one % in exchange for # cruor.
13188 : % obtains # % in exchange for # cruor.

13197 : I see you have foraged up % from the Sacrarium. Jolly good.
13198 : While that is all well and good, other keys of antithetical power to the one you currently hold also exist. Could you go and find one of those as well?
13199 : Why, those are % and %! Commendable work, indeed, [good chap/fair lady].
13200 : To think that someone of your generation would dredge up both sorts of these past relics... I am thoroughly impressed.
13201 : In honor of your intrepid character, allow me to present you this skeleton key. I hope we Tavnazian knights can continue to expect big things from you!
13202 : Well, well, look who the cat dragged in!
13203 : %? I wanted to go see you myself, but things've been heating up out here.
13204 : I've given up my hell of a crazy life and am getting ready to be a beautiful bride.
13205 : What? No, I'd rather die than learn how to cook and clean!
13206 : You got bricks for brains? I'm talking about 1000 Needles, Nightmare, Pestilent Penance, Megaflare...all that good stuff!
13207 : A good bride masters all manner of techniques before she goes on her honeymoon...right?
13208 : But enough about me. How've you been treating yourself all this time? Do you cry a few tears into the skulls you crush thinking how much fun you could be having with me?
13209 : Maybe I can't read that black heart of yours anymore, but it doesn't take a mind reader to see what you're here for.
13210 : Yup! I could tell from a malm away that you had that silly paper on you.
13211 : The hell are you waiting for? Let's roll up our sleeves and get down and dirty with this Trust thing!
13212 : Gotta admit I'm a bit curious myself as to how this'll work out.
13213 : Attempt the Trust ritual? Let's go! On second thought...
13214 : C'mon, %, you're killing me here! Don't make me beat the crap outta you!
13215 : Some institute of whatever in Jeuno came up with it, and I hear it's the best thing since sliced orobon!
13216 : I'd bet gil to greedies that Mildaurion and the Zilart would be chomping at the bit to get their hands on it.
13217 : But the stuffy mages haven't let slip a damned word to anyone I know...not even the unassuming Ulmia!
13218 : Speaking of, you been to see her yet?
13219 : They chose her to participate, and what does she do? Run around like a chocobo with its head cut off, blubbering about violation of privacy or whatever.
13220 : Why she's so embarrassed about alter egos is beyond me. She can sure belt out a tune, so imagine a full ensemble of six or seven Ulmias!
13221 : You actually got her to go along with it!?
13222 : I didn't think you had it in you! She was so flustered by the whole thing, I figured she'd crumble at the mere suggestion of it. Well done, pal!
13223 : But let's get back to what matters--your relationship with me.
13224 : I was only vaguely paying attention to the damned lecture the institute gave me, but they said something about bonds of friendship and trust being the key.
13225 : Trust? Hah! We've got so much more than that.
13226 : After all, which dynamic duo saved the world from ruin at the hands of Promathia?
13227 : If I couldn't trust you, why would I let you out of my sight for a minute? No, it's more than trust--it's destiny!
13228 : Ah, crap...but there's more to it than that. There's also friendship, too.
13229 : Now that I think about it, I remember a time when some old jeweler over in Jeuno was going on and on about what love really is.
13230 : You know what I learned from him? That love ain't something you know about until it hits you. So that means I don't know what love is?
13231 : But I recall sharing something with a certain young girl...
13232 : Animals have hearts and souls, just like people do, and their hearts are much more pure than ours.
13233 : Now if only I were as pure as a moogle, then maybe...
13234 : Ah, screw it all! What's this weird heat coming from my cheeks?
13235 : [Well, then/Hmm... Come to think of it], the two of us make one hell of a team, don't you agree?
13236 : Although a certain someone yelled at me not to leap without looking all the time.
13237 : Let me share with you a little something. There's this geezer over in Jeuno, always with his fishing rod by the docks, who musta stared daggers at me for hours on end.
13238 : You'd picture he'd've just told me to be careful, but oh no!
13239 : If it were you in a pit of snakes, though, I wouldn't care what any old fart would have to say! I'd throw myself in after you in a heartbeat!
13240 : [Well, the/Let's continue. The] two of us can lick any problem, big or small.
13241 : The Shadow Lord, Kam'lanaut, Eald'narche, Nag'Molada...doesn't matter one bit to me.
13242 : They may have succumbed--but we didn't. And you remember why, don't you?
13243 : The light that brought us into this world shines brighter than the sun, and continues to bless the world, its people, and our hearts.
13244 : [Getting down to business,/With all that said,] let's get the show on the road!
13245 : Can't be that hard, right? A little bim, bam, boom, and off we go!
13246 : Screw them all! I'm Prishe, and I've got your back for as long as I've got the energy!
13247 : 'Course, that'll mean I'll have to double up on meals. Heh heh.
13248 : And if I'll be by your side the whole time, I'm gonna need a whole safehold full of dhalmel steaks!
13249 : Double up? Maybe triple up?
13250 : No, no! Quadruple up!
13251 : It'd be nice if I could head out on another adventure with you myself...
13252 : But I'm sure this one here can handle it.
13253 : Just keep her safe and fed, and she'll kick the snot out of anything that gets in your way!
13254 : Good day to you, and welcome to Mhaura. My name is Marilionne, and I'd be happy to offer you any guidance you may need.
13255 : Good day to you, and welcome to Selbina. My name is Esteban, and I'd be happy to offer you any guidance you may need.
13256 : It's not often we get visitors to Tavnazia. My name is Ombelotte, and I'd be...happy to offer you any guidance you may need.
13257 : Inquire about what? I want to find some quests! I want a map of [Mhaura/Selbina]! I have other questions. Nothing for now.
13258 : Inquire about what? I want to find some quests! I want a map of Tavnazia! I have other questions. Nothing for now.
13259 : If you bring me a map of the [Windurst/San d'Oria] area, I can place a couple markers on it for you. Surely that's better than flittering around aimlessly, no?
13260 : Ludwig should be able to sell you one. He's south along the coast, and you'll find him on the left side of the grand plaza.
13261 : Come back with a map of the [San d'Oria/Windurst] area, and I'll place a couple markers to guide you on your path.

13263 : Bring me a map of Tavnazia, and I can mark some places that'll help set you on the right path.
13264 : You know who can help you procure a map? Elysia--provided you help her out. Let me show you where she is.
13265 : There're many people both inside and outside of [Mhaura/Selbina] who need an adventurer's help with some problem or other. In fact, I've got a handy list of such individuals. Want me to help you find someone?
13266 : Tavnazia may look safe, but there are always people who need an adventurer's aid. Would you like me to find some such people?
13267 : Inquire about which locale? None. [Mhaura/Selbina]: # individual[/s]. [Selbina/Mhaura]: # individual[/s]. Other: # individual[/s].
13268 : [In Mhaura/In Selbina], you might be able to get work from one of the people I'm about to list for you.

13270 : Outside of town, you might be able to get work from one of the people I'm about to list for you.
13271 : You can find them in [Pashhow Marshlands/Carpenter's Landing deep in Northern San d'Oria/Riverne-Site #A01 in Tavnazia/Uleguerand Range/Oldton Movalpolos deep in North Gustaberg/Xarcabard/Boneyard Gully deep in Attohwa Chasm/La Theine Plateau/Monastic Cavern in Davoi/Qulun Dome in Beadeaux/The Altar Room in Castle Oztroja/Past Pashhow Marshlands].

13280 : Flandiace right in front of me can provide you with more information.
13281 : If you open the main menu and press the right arrow key, you'll come across an entry called Help Desk.
13282 : Selecting that option and then clicking Help Desk again brings up a small list, of which one entry reads I need help with the game controls.

13293 : You may teleport between these crystalline nodes called home points for efficient travel. Be sure to examine any you stumble upon.

13300 : I hate to say it, but the merchants around here are pretty stingy. You'd have more luck listing any unwanted goods at the auction house.
13301 : I advise you to put any unwanted goods up for sale at the auction house rather than be taken advantage of by the vendors here.
13302 : If there's something you've got that you don't need, try putting it up at the auction house rather than selling it to some unscrupulous vendor.
