6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7162 : The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.

7164 : If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.
7165 : Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.
7166 : A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.
7167 : The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.

7169 : A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.
7170 : Once an item appears on your Sales Status list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.
7171 : If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select Stop Sale from the Sales Status menu.
7172 : To remove an item from your Sales Status list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.

7307 : Here at the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition, we entrust various tasks related to [the colonization effort/the protection of Adoulin/the transport of goods through Adoulin and Ulbuka/the collection of information for the benefit of the coalition/the pursuit of new technologies/the provision of new entertainment forms] to those willing to aid our cause.
7308 : %, is it not? Brenton at the Pioneers' Coalition has been looking for you. Please go see him at your earliest convenience.
7309 : %, correct? Brenton here would like to have a word with you. He said it was important.
7310 : [Welcome back./I'm glad to see you again./We've been waiting for you./Back and better than ever, I see./How are things?/Why, hello there!] It is my understanding that you have completed one of our tasks. Do you have anything to report?
7311 : Let me take a look... Why, this % is broken! I'll give you another one, but you really must be more careful with something so valuable.
7312 : Let me take a look... This % is broken. Unfortunately, it's of no use to us now. Go back to the frontier station and bring back another one--whole, this time!
7313 : I wish you speed upon your journey.
7314 : You're not a registered pioneer? I am only authorized to give tasks to those with the appropriate credentials.
7315 : Come back when you have the requisite certification.
7316 : Since you're already here, why not take a few minutes to fill out the forms? It won't take long.
7317 : Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment? Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.
7318 : The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.
7319 : We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.
7320 : Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.
7321 : This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.
7322 : Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.
7323 : However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.
7324 : You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to # of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.
7325 : In your case, we will render you with a total of # imprimaturs every # hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.
7326 : One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.
7327 : Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.
7328 : The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.
7329 : You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.
7330 : There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: coalition referendums.
7331 : The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.
7332 : When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.
7333 : A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.
7334 : The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.
7335 : I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.
7336 : Since this is your first time here, I shall provide you with a total of # imprimaturs so that you may get started right away.
7337 : What would you like to do? (# imprimatur[/s]) Undertake a coalition assignment. Report on a completed assignment. Cancel an in-progress assignment. Check imprimatur distribution time. Hear an explanation of the system. End the conversation.
7338 : What's this, then? You don't have any imprimaturs? Hmm... You needn't be overly worried, for the next batch will be distributed in # [second/minute][/s].
7339 : Select which assignment to cancel.
7340 : Really cancel? Yes. No.
7341 : I have filled out this form stating your cancellation, and restored your imprimaturs to their original amount.
7342 : This makes for a total of # imprimatur[/s] currently in your possession.
7343 : The next batch of imprimaturs will be distributed in # [second/minute][/s].
7344 : You seem to be in possession of the maximum number of imprimaturs. If you do not use them before the next distribution, you will not receive any additional ones.
7345 : We look forward to seeing you again.
7346 : We are currently able to offer you the following coalition assignments.
7347 : Unfortunately, we do not currently have any assignments for you to undertake.
7348 : Select how many imprimaturs you would like to expend for this assignment.
7349 : How many will you use? (Total: #). One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Hang on one moment.
7350 : Use # imprimatur[/s]? Of course! No way.
7351 : You used # imprimatur[/s], and currently have a stock of #.
7352 : Return here once you have completed your assignment. We appreciate your assistance and hope for your safe return.
7353 : Your report was quite valuable. Thank you. We ask that you submit your vote in the coalition referendum before receiving your reward.
7354 : Select which item the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition should prioritize in its expansion plan.
7355 : Truly abstain from voting? Yes. Voting is institutionalized coercion. No. Democracy is a privilege.
7356 : It's a shame you feel that way. Still, you deserve proper compensation. Here you go.
7357 : Would you like to vote this way? Yes. It's my Goddess-given duty. No. My vote doesn't count anyway.
7358 : [Really? That?/Are you sure?/I can't believe.../Hmm.../That's not the way I would have taken it...] Well, I suppose that's why it's your vote, and not mine. What's important is that you expressed your opinion. And now, your compensation.
7359 : I congratulate you on your success and am pleased to hear your report. The coalition has prepared a reward befitting your contributions.

7412 : We also give additional rewards based on the degree of construction or the durability of the facility to those pioneers brave enough to travel far distances or into particularly dangerous territory.
7413 : We also give additional rewards based on the extent of the survey to those pioneers brave enough to travel far distances or into particularly dangerous territory.
7414 : [Why, hello there, my dear pioneer!/Good day to you./Hello, pioneer./Welcome to our establishmentaru!/I hope you're having a marvelous-warvelous day!/Welcome back!] Is there anything you'd like to know about the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition?
7415 : What would you like to know about? The [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition's role. The state of the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition. Types of coalition assignments. Current expansion plans. Coalition referendum support. Your current standing. Nothing.
7416 : The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.
7417 : It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.
7418 : The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.
7419 : The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.
7420 : We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.
7421 : The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.
7422 : The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.
7423 : We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.
7424 : Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.
7425 : The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.
7426 : The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.
7427 : Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.
7428 : The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.
7429 : We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.
7430 : Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.
7431 : The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.
7432 : It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.
7433 : Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.
7434 : The [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition is currently rank number #.
7435 : According to the most recent surveys, this coalition [is a blight on the city./is nothing to write home about./isn't half bad./is expanding nicely./is a credit to the city./puts others to shame!/is a paragon of prosperity!] [You might want to try to remedy that./Keep trying./Your efforts are starting to pay off./That said, you're still only halfway to the top./Feel free to gloat about your accomplishments./I hope you're not afraid of heights, because you're incredibly close to the top!/How's the view from the top? Great? Then keep up the excellent work!]
7436 : You've all been [abysmal/uninspiring/decent/remarkable/positively miraculous] at accomplishing your coalition assignments. Our coalition's rank [will almost certainly fall/may fall/will probably stay about the same/might rise/will almost certainly rise] after the next evaluation.

7451 : What assignments will you ask about? Procuring resources. Clearing the way. Preserving the peace. Patrols. Base provisions. Delivering supplies. Frontline support. Land surveys. Component analysis. Gathering materials. Recovering lost articles. Behavioral research. Morale boosting. Nothing.
7452 : Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.
7453 : It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.
7454 : Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.
7455 : The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.
7456 : Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.
7457 : If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.
7458 : While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.
7459 : Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.
7460 : For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet, from some wily veterans.
7461 : Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.
7462 : You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.
7463 : By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.
7464 : The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.
7465 : Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.
7466 : Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.
7467 : The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.
7468 : Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.
7469 : The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.
7470 : The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.
7471 : While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.
7472 : Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.
7473 : This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.
7474 : Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.
7475 : The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!
7476 : The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.
7477 : Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.
7478 : This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.
7479 : Which plan do you want to learn about? Coalition flag. Signboard. Emblem. Second floor. Adoulinian flag. Main terrace. Bay roof. Main chimney. None.
7480 : If the [/coalition flag/signboard/emblem/second floor/Adoulinian flag/main terrace/bay roof/main chimney] expansion plan succeeds, the staff in charge of [Gathering Goods/Gathering Goods II/Gathering Equipment/Gathering Technique Knowledge/Colonization Support Provisions/Gathering Goods III/Gathering Equipment II/Colonization Support Provisions II/Gathering Technique Knowledge II] will [increase in number/expand throughout the continent/provide additional services/be more successful].

7508 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
7509 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
7510 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
7511 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
7512 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
7513 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
7514 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
7515 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
7516 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
7517 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
7518 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
7519 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
7520 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
7521 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
7522 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
7523 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
7524 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
7525 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
7526 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
7527 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!
7528 : It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!
7529 : You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!
7530 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
7531 : Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
7532 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
7533 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
7534 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
7535 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
7536 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
7537 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
7538 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
7539 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
7540 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
7541 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
7542 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
7543 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
7544 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
7545 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
7546 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
7547 : It's all yours, kupo!
7548 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!
7549 : Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
7550 : I found this item in the back of one of the %'s drawers, kupo!
7551 : It's all yours, kupo!
7552 : I found this in the back of the %, kupo!
7553 : It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo! Here, take it, kupo!
7554 : I found this item inside the %, kupo!
7555 : Luck is on your side, kupo! Take it, kupo!
7556 : I fished this item out of the %, kupo!
7557 : It was very hard work, kupo... I'm very tired, kupo...
7558 : I found this behind the % painting, kupo!
7559 : This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
7560 : Something clattered inside the % when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
7561 : It's all yours, kupo!
7562 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
7563 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
7564 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
7565 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
7566 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
7567 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
7568 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
7569 : Each item of furniture you place using the Layout command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
7570 : When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!

7573 : mes8
7574 : mes9
7575 : TEST-No.#
7576 : I found % inside the %, kupo!
7577 : Kupo...? I sense that this % is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!
7578 : Master! Master! Look what I found underneath the % this morning, kupo!
7579 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
7580 : Look what I found in your %!
7581 : You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it. I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!
7582 : Your Mog Locker lease is valid until #/#/# #:#:#, kupo.
7583 : The lease on your Mog Locker has expired, kupo. Please trade % to me or to Fubruhn in Aht Urhgan Whitegate.
7584 : Your Mog Locker lease has been extended until #/#/# #:#:#, kupo!
7585 : Master, Master! I found this in the %, kupo!
7586 : It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
7587 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
7588 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
7589 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
7590 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
7591 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
7592 : Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
7593 : Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
7594 : We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
7595 : Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
7596 : Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your %, when this % just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
7597 : Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
7598 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
7599 : Look at what I found while cleaning out the %: %!
7600 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
7602 : It all began with a raindrop,      or so the legend says...
7603 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
7604 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
7605 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
7606 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
7607 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
7608 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
7609 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
7610 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
7611 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
7612 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
7613 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
7614 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
7615 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
7616 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
7617 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
7618 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...
7619 : Do something? Read instructions. Change parameters. Teleport to key locations. Warp to home point. Receive items. Obtain 100,000,000 gil. Do nothing.
7620 : Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
7621 : But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!
7622 : Furthermore, you may trade a moogle storage slip to me to wipe it clean, or mystically entrust its entire contents to me. Quite convenient, wouldn't you say?

7662 : Hang on! I have an amazing announcement!
7663 : The hallowed halls of your house are even more exciting! Why? Because now there's a second floor, kupo!
7664 : But before you bash your way in, I've got a trifling task for you to tackle.
7665 : Capricious Mithra cubs have cajoled critical information out of the M.H.M.U., and I want you to wrest it from them!
7666 : Visit the three nations and question them, kupo!
7667 : Now you know the nitty-gritty, so enjoy your new floor, kupo!
7668 : Kupopo? You mean you already know?
7669 : Magnificent and marvelous! Then proceed without delay!
7670 : Enjoy extra space to store your sundries!
7671 : Remodel your room to fit your finicky tastes!
7672 : Incorporate ostentatious overseas objects! All this and more!
7673 : But only on the second floor, kupo. I like the first floor as it is.
7674 : And as for your potted plants--they only persevere on the ground, kupo.
7675 : And moghancement effects only activate for furnishings fitted to the first floor.
7676 : Wish we could help more, but we spend enormous amounts of energy on one floor already!
7677 : Go forth and frolic in your new abode, kupo!
7678 : You can access the antechambers from the front door. Enjoy!
7679 : % might bring a certain je ne sais quoi to your Mog House, kupo!
7680 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
7681 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
7682 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
7683 : Oh, what a cruel, cruel master, kupo!!!
7684 : Thank you, kupo! I...have one more favor to ask. It's almost time for the festival in the moogles' hometown, kupo!
7685 : Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him % as a gift, kupo!
7686 : Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and % would make the perfect present, kupo!

7693 : Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
7694 : Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!
7695 : Looking at that shabby old bed makes me feel homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
7696 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
7697 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
7698 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
7699 : Thank you, kupo! I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!
7700 : Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
7701 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!
7702 : But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
7703 : Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
7704 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!

7711 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
7712 : After resting on the %, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?
7713 : Give your moogle some time off? Have fun, kupo! No, I am your only friend now!
7714 : Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!
7715 : The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take % for my friends there, kupo!
7716 : And my other buddies need % for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!
7717 : I can't help out my friends if I don't have % and %, kupo...
7718 : I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!
7719 : Master! I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!
7720 : We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!
7721 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
7722 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
7723 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
7724 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
7725 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
7726 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
7727 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
7728 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
7729 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
7730 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
7731 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
7732 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
7733 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
7734 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
7735 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
7736 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
7737 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
7738 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
7739 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
7740 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
7741 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
7742 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
7743 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?

7843 : Thanks for coming all this way. I'd love to offer you some hospitality, but we'd need to get this frontier station completed first! Could you lend us a hand by signing up for a coalition assignment?
7844 : Thanks so much for delivering this %! I can't wait to see how this station looks once it's built. If you want, you can go pick up your reward from the manager who gave you this assignment.
7845 : We're glad you tried your best, but destroyed % are useless to us. Sorry, but can you pick up another one from the manager in charge?
7846 : Welcome to the frontier! This station has already been built, but you can always help construct some bivouacs or keep them supplied.
7847 : Frontier stations are self-sufficient, but the bivouacs are sadly not. We'd be extremely appreciative if you could undertake some assignments to make sure they stay in operation.
7848 : Hello, there! We have some materials we'd like delivered to town, but we have to go through the right channels. Would you mind undertaking a coalition assignment to transport them back?
7849 : Thank you for helping us out. Here's the %. All we ask is that you take it to the manager in charge of this assignment.
7850 : Thank you for helping us out. All we ask is that you deliver your cargo safely to the manager in charge of this assignment.
7851 : Well, here's another %, but please be careful not to break this one.
7852 : Good day to you. This is [the future site of /]frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5].
7853 : Thank you for the %. We greatly appreciate your efforts to [help set up/provision] frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5]. Please speak with the manager in charge of this assignment to collect your reward.
7854 : I'm terribly sorry, but we can't use broken %. Could you please return to the coalition assignment desk and procure us another?
7855 : How nice it is to see another face out here! As much as I'd like for you to help us set up frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5], we won't be able to do anything until we've established a base of operations with a frontier station.
7856 : The magical properties of the waypoint proved too much for your % to handle, and it broke...
7857 : This seems to be the site of the ergon locus oft called the [/Flourishing Island/Bud of the Swarm/Luminous Isle/Immutable Boulder/Immaculate Sands/Fruit of Fecundity/Dragon Driftwood/Torchbloom/Spring of Prosperity/Snowdrift Arbor/Frostbloom/Prominence of the Gales/Lake of Light/Sweltering Spring/Prominence of the Flame].

7868 : It's so tough constructing frontier stations. It's always build, build, build, and scrounge, scrounge, scrounge. All I want is a little break from the monotony of it all.
7869 : It's so tough maintaining a frontier station. I'm always fending off bloodthirsty hellions and scrounging for provisions. All I want is a little break from the monotony of it all.
7870 : What will you do? Look pleased. Cry a river. Act surprised. Rue your life. Cheer. Pretend to be flustered. Blush like a maiden. Rally the troops. Nothing for now.
7871 : Ahahaha! Of all the things to pull, I never thought you'd do that! I had no idea that was coming.
7872 : Um...is something the matter with you? Maybe you should see a physician...
7873 : Approaching from that direction [might not have been very effective/was probably the right thing to do.]. As for your gag, [it wasn't with the times/it was right on the mark].
7874 : You don't know how much I needed something like that. Thank you.
7875 : [Construction on /]Frontier Bivouac #[1/2/3/4/5] is[/ currently at] # percent [complete/durability]. We are in need of [materials with which to set up camp/provisions], so would it be possible for you to undertake a coalition assignment and assist us in [building this thing/keeping this place running]?
7876 : You came here from a faraway land, right?
7877 : Then you can be in our brigade! Yay!
7878 : Look, you get a neat badge if you join! Oh, but this one's for leaders only. Yours won't be as neat.
7879 : I know you want a badge. I can see it in your eyes. If you want to join, you'll need to show us that special pioneer power!
7880 : If you're smart like me, you'll already know where to get it.
7881 : I bet you don't, though. How about I give you a hint? Try reeeal hard to remember what that guy said when you registered.
7882 : Wh-wh-what?! You already have it!?
7883 : ...I knew that! I was just double-testing you!
7884 : Wow, you're kind of dumb for an adult. Look around the west of Western Adoulin for a woman. If you can't find it with that hint, you don't deserve to be on our force!
7885 : What do you need, hon?
7886 : Ah, so Merleg wants you to show him the power of an ionis.
7887 : You know how children are at that age. They're just very excited about becoming pioneers and working for certain coalitions. I think it's wonderful that they're showing an interest in their hometown.
7888 : Merleg and some of the other children even walk around town pretending to keep the city safe. They call themselves the Fantastic Adoulin Imperial Liberators.
7889 : Sometimes we have to tell them to tone it down and keep out of trouble, but for the most part--
7890 : Oh, my! Where are my manners? You came to have Ionis cast on you, didn't you?
7891 : May the founder king's undying love protect you this day!
7892 : Now you're now outfitted with an ionis. Go back and give those children the show of their lives!
7893 : I can feel a special power flowing from you. There's no mistaking it--you have Ionis on you!
7894 : I guess you pass. Welcome to the Fantastic Adoulin Imperial Liberators. Here's your neat badge that's not as neat as mine, like I promised.
7895 : Show it to anyone in the brigade and they'll let you in on our secrets.
7896 : <Sigh> They like to run you ragged at the waterfront warehouse.
7897 : How am I supposed to work when they won't let me eat!?
7898 : I'm so hungry...but I'm sick of Adoulinian food. It tastes like acuex toxin. I deserve something from the Middle Lands for all my hard work.
7899 : Aha! I remember some guy who came back from the Middle Lands was talking about %!
7900 : That's what I want! Can you get it for me? If I can eat it now before it's widely imported, I can say I liked it before it was popular!
7901 : Hurry up! I won't be able to move a single step until you bring me %.
7902 : Yeeeeeeeeeeees! You got % for me! After all this time, I finally have %!
7903 : <Sniff, sniff>... What a delightful smell... I can already imagine a matronly figure in an apron slaving over a hot batch of it while the warm Quon sun shines through the window!
7904 : <Gulp>... This's the tastiest thing that's ever passed my lips!
7905 : The flavor's so simple...but it also has a mellow backing. All my anger has completely disappeared... I love my job!
7906 : This single bowl of soup has given me a zest for life! It's even made me nostalgic for Adoulinian food!
7907 : Speaking of which...if you want a good Ulbukan restaurant, head out of Platea Triumphus towards Big Bridge. I heartily recommend it.
7908 : Hey, this isn't % at all... No use letting good food go to waste, though.
7909 : This isn't half bad! But bring me % next time, okay?
7910 : Damn it! Why's it gotta be now, of all times!? ...SOS, pioneer! SOS!
7911 : Fish're swarmin' all over! I ain't never seen so many of 'em in one place before!
7912 : But, as luck would have it, my harpoon done broke and it's takin' the wind outta my sails! Maybe I should've been more careful and looked where I was stabbin'...
7913 : I still gots me favorite harpoon, Hilda, but no way in Davy Jones's locker I'm usin' her in these waters! Normally I'd just drop anchor in the Inventors' Coalition and get them to fix it for me, but...I can't let these fish outta my sight!
7914 : That's where you come in, sailor.
7915 : Could you help an old salt out and have them fix this shoddy one for me?
7916 : I dunno how I'd repay you, but I'm sure I'll think of something while tacklin' these whoppers!
7917 : Quick, time's a-wastin'. These fish could be gone any minute! To the Inventors' Coalition with my %, matey!
7918 : If you're here seeking the brightaruest minds in all of Adoulin, then you're in luck! Welcome to the Inventors' Coalition.
7919 : Or maybe you've come to gaze longingly at me, the best coalition's postaru girl?
7920 : What? You want us to fixy-wix % for some fisherman? Hmmm...
7921 : No problem! Just because we're the greataruest coalition around doesn't mean we're above helping townsfolk.
7922 : We get jobs like this all the time! I've spruced up tools and tinkered with utensils for citizen-witizens so often that I've lost countaru.
7923 : Also, the more good deeds I do, the more popular-wopular I become! I'll have the whole city licking my bootarus soon enough.
7924 : ...Oh, yes. The harpoon.
7925 : First, bang on it with some heavy-weavy tools... Next, twistaru until just before the breaking point... ...And there we go. Drumroll please...
7926 : Ta-da! Here you are, perfectly reconstructarued!
7927 : Well, actually, it should be better than before. I enhanced its durability so it'll last multiple-wultiple times as long.
7928 : Since I'm so generous-wenerous, I also took the liberty of adding a button that makes it expand and retract. I'm just that selfless.
7929 : No need to thank me. Your love and adoration should prove more than sufficientaru.
7930 : I see the Inventors' Coalition done lived up to their reputation once again!
7931 : They've bailed me out so much over the years--especially that kind Tarutaru girl. She may seem shallower than the Zoldeff durin' a drought, but she's got a heart larger'n an orobon's maw.
7932 : I ain't got much to return the favor with, but I always try to give 'em some of my catch when I can. I know how int'restin' them books and all can be, but sometimes you need to stuff some food down your gullet.
7933 : Plus, the last thing I be needin' is for them to faint from hunger when my tools give out.
7934 : Eh? What be this button here? Whoa...it just got longer than a jagil's maw all by itself!
7935 : Ugh...I always tell 'em they don't need to include all this weird stuff.
7936 : I 'ppreciate the thought, but when the big one bites, you want somethin' you're used to, not some newfangled whatsamajigger.
7937 : They ain't mean bad by it, so I guess I can't complain...
7938 : Well, if anything else happens to me, I'll be on the lookout for you!
7939 : Whaddya want?
7940 : I don't have time for louses like y...
7941 : Wait a minute. You seem like you have time on your hands. Why don't I give you some wholesome work? None of this stirring-up-trouble-in-the-jungle stuff.
7942 : The guard on duty today fell asleep before his patrol, that laggard. Take this paper with his route on it and fill in for him. You've got nothing better to do, right?
7943 : Follow those instructions to the letter. They shouldn't be hard to figure out, even for an outsider like you.
7944 : I thought I sent you out on patrol! Are you purposefully trying to scare our people? Now go!
7945 : Ah, %! How are you today?
7946 : Oh, you're on patrol for the Peacekeepers' Coalition? Nice to see you giving back to the community.
7947 : There's nothing of note whatsoever around here, and the colonization effort is proceeding just fine. Thank you so much for checking in.
7948 : I know some people are opposed to what we do, while others are terrified of the risks involved, but I hope you won't mind taking assignments from the Pioneers' Coalition sometime.
7949 : Hi there... Welcome to the Couriers' Coalition.
7950 : What? You're making rounds...to see how things are...?
7951 : No need to worry...about us. It's all going...well. Shipments to the coalitions...are okay. Shipments to the frontier...are okay.
7952 : W-we have all the local deliveries, um, covered. But we always ask p-pioneers to, er, transport jungle-bound cargo. I h-hope you'll...you know, help us out with that stuff...in the future.
7953 : Anything remotely important to life in Adoulin or pioneering winds up in this warehouse. Why do you want to know?
7954 : Ah, so you're filling in for the regular patrolman. No wonder he hadn't come by yet.
7955 : Anyway, no problems on the Adoulin Waterfront.
7956 : Stop dawdling and go help some people who need it. All I require is more time to carry all these provisions.
7957 : Oh, and don't ever come here at night! I don't care how beautiful you think the scenery is.
7958 : Especially not with your [girlfriend/boyfriend]! If you don't want to sleep with the fishes, you'll take that to heart.
7959 : Performing random acts of kindness for Adoulinians again? How thoughtful.
7960 : On one hand, I'm sorry we don't have any work for you. On the other, it's a relief that all's well.
7961 : Have you ever noticed the fountain here in Platea Triumphus? It's named Fontis Xanira, after one of the knights who fought beside the founder king against the continent's evil forces.
7962 : Though the origin of its name may seem imposing, today people come here to take a load off.
7963 : The next time you come by on patrol, how about resolving some residents' disputes with me? Oh, and I'm always willing to lend an ear should you feel lonely.
7964 : If you're here seeking the brightaruest minds in all of Adoulin, then you're in luck! Welcome to the Inventors' Coalition.
7965 : Or maybe you've come to gaze longingly at me, the best coalition's postaru girl?
7966 : On patrol, you say? Let me think. Do we have any tasky-wasks that require your assistance...?
7967 : We're currently working on all the gadgetarus in need of repair, that fertilizer has been sent to the Civic Arboretum, and I believe our research into Mog Garden construction is progressing-wessing well.
7968 : The only thing I can think of is how we sometimes run out of materials. We wouldn't have to worry if you'd take some assignmentarus from us, though. You know, the more jobs you undertake, the more you get to see wonderful little me.
7969 : The ferry that docks here transports pioneers to the chain of small islands that compose the Adoulinian residential area.
7970 : I doubt you intend to utilize it while you are on patrol, but feel free to follow your desires and board at any time.
7971 : As for possible problems, we are not experiencing any currently. Every vessel is on schedule and the seas are calm.
7972 : Oh, and should you ever wish to visit the residential area, simply pass through this arch and descend the steps to the dock. That is all, [sir/ma'am].
7973 : We're always glad to have people come inside the Mummers' Coalition!
7974 : Hey, I just made up a theme song for us! Want to hear it? I love fun, fun loves me, we're-- Oh, you're on patrol... Sorry.
7975 : Adoulin's finest have nothing to worry about. All the people here are happy and content.
7976 : We try our best to have everyone in the city get the most out of life. We hold grand events, cheer soldiers up on the battlefield, and constantly cook up new ways to entertain Adoulinians! Come get some assignments from us if you want to see more of what we're about.
7977 : ...Ooor drop by and play one of our games the next time you want to have some fun.
7978 : Finally finished, huh? ...No one was troubled by anything? Good.
7979 : Speaking of trouble, everyone in the Peacekeepers' Coalition makes ridding our city of it their number one priority! There's no room for those who can't follow this mantra. That's why we'll be punishing the person you replaced today.
7980 : Patrolling the streets is not our only tactic. We also look out upon Adoulin from guard towers and the city walls. If we see any fires of discontent, we snuff them out!
7981 : Should monsters somehow breach Jorius Yett, we'll be there to stop them, too.
7982 : See, we have enough problems without having to deal with pioneers. Watch your step around this town, or we might just have to deal with you.
7983 : What excellent timing! I am loath to impose, but I require your assistance.
7984 : It is such a blight on my spotless record that I hesitate to even explain why I must seek your aid...but it is inevitable.
7985 : I...I did not exercise the appropriate amount of caution, and we have received the wrong supplies.
7986 : The item in question still remains in my possession, but I have not the time to rectify this error myself. Would you be so kind as to deliver it to the warehouse at the Adoulin Waterfront for me?
7987 : Passing it off to the supervisor there will be sufficient. It is his job to transport it to the assigned location.
7988 : Goddess speed you, pioneer.
7989 : What!? The wrong destination!? ...<Sigh> I hate when this happens.
7990 : Gimme that...uh-huh... Looks like this was originally bound for C-6 in the Rala Waterways.
7991 : Take the road up that hill over there and you'll find another street that leads to them. Take a right once you're inside and you'll come to a sluice gate.
7992 : Put it down near there. It's an important package, too, so I'll curse you to your grave if someone sees you down there. What? I don't care what that Elvaan said. I don't have the time to deal with lost packages.
7993 : I have been informed that the package made it to its destination safely. Thank you so much.
7994 : I know full well that such mistakes are a common occurrence, but I cannot help but feel the crushing weight of failure upon my shoulders whenever confronted with such situations. The saving grace of it all is that nothing happened to the package.
7995 : From now on, I pledge to be even more involved in the supervision of Couriers' Coalition members.
7996 : My apologies. I have already squandered so much of your precious time. I shall waste no more with trivial banter.
7997 : Fare thee well, pioneer.
7998 : Good work. Everything's in order. Now shove it.
7999 : We haven't given up just yet. We just need to bide our time, that's all.
8000 : Thanks for that % earlier.
8001 : Phew, my throat sure is dry, though...
8002 : Hey, hey, hey! Don't be like that! We're the bestest of all friends for eternity, remember?
8003 : And since you're such a good friend, I know you'll want to surprise me. Get me a drink made from something that'll knock my tunic off!
8004 : I can't wait to get my liquid gift. You're such a good friend, %.
8005 : Hey, I thought you were going to surprise me with a drink. I'm going to shrivel into a skeleton if you don't hurry up!
8006 : Yeeeeeeeees! Such an...<gulp>...intense aroma... So this is the fabled %...
8007 : If this is made by Goblins...I best prepare my stomach...
8008 : Ew...it smells like raw fish! But...I asked for it...so here goes nothing!
8009 : <Glug>...<gluk>...<gulp>... Bleeeeeech, it tastes like bilge water! Get it away from me!
8010 : My tongue's coated in it. Yuck, I feel it crawling down my throat! Oh no, I can even smell it when I open my mouth!
8011 : Haaah...haaah...haaah... I don't think you want to drink that. Instead, try the caf across Big Bridge in one of Eastern Adoulin's plazas.
8012 : It's too hoity-toity for my tastes, but I just may have to go there anyway... I need to cleanse my palate.
8013 : This isn't much of a surprise. It's so...normal.
8014 : Hey, this is kind of tasty! Too bad it's not what I'm looking for. You'll need to bring me something else, buddy.
8015 : We've shared so many memories together, haven't we? Like the time you gave me that %. I had to curl up on the ground for hours before I stopped feeling sick.
8016 : But anyway... The little chocobo who told me about % recently chirped to me about a pink beverage.
8017 : Apparently the liquid inside is heretical or something, and bizarre stuff happens to your body when you drink it!
8018 : I've gotta have one! I must experience its effects firsthand!
8019 : Ha, nice try. That face won't work on me. I've seen it too many times already.
8020 : Make sure it's the pink one that's sparkling. Sparkling and pink, okay? Okay!
8021 : If you don't get me that sparkling pink drink, I'm gonna go tear you limb from limb like a Velkk marauder, buddy.
8022 : Yeeeeeeeees! It's pink...it's sparkly...it's <gulp> exactly what I asked for!
8023 : <Glug>...hm? ...It goes down smoother than pugil roe! Oh, and there's the slightest bite to it that brings out its sweetness. I love it!
8024 : Ack! By the founder king, the pain consumes my soul! Altana, forgive me my trespasses...!
8025 : So the rumors were true! It is cursed! ...%, when will my body stop shaking?
8026 : Maybe getting back to work will make me forget how disgusting I feel...
8027 : This isn't very pink and doesn't sparkle...but oh well.
8028 : Not bad! Next time, bring me a sparkling pink one, friend of friends. And make it snappy!
8029 : Hey, this is the same drink from before! Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice...well, you're not gonna fool me twice!
8030 : I want the one that's pink and sparkling! Pink and shiny, I say!

8038 : Good day to you, adventurer! Have you registered with the Pioneers' Coalition yet? If not, I strongly recommend you take the time to do so at your earliest convenience!
8039 : Another day, another distraction, adventurer! Would you like to learn more about this splendiferous machine here?
8040 : Any interest in the device? You betcha! Not particularly.
8041 : Aww, and I had my script all planned out, too! If you ever change your mind, you know where to find me!
8042 : This is a magical apparatus referred to as a waypoint. You can use it to instantaneously teleport to anywhere in Western Adoulin.
8043 : Oh ho, forgive me for babying you. Of course you know that much--you probably used one to get here!
8044 : As you can imagine, it's quite a convenient little invention, but I'd only try going places you've visited before, if I were you.
8045 : <Mutter> Some idiots try to go places they've never heard of and get their heads all turned around...
8046 : Oops--looks like my inner monologue slipped out again. I'm sure you can imagine what a pain it must be to guide the lost back home. Twaha!
8047 : All joking aside, if you don't have % attuned to where you want to go, the thing just won't work!
8048 : More precisely, it's not the location itself so much as the magnetic fields located there. So, to make things more convenient in the long run, you'll want to walk from place to place and attune your %.
8049 : Once it's attuned, you're free to zip around as you please. So why dillydally? Let's get started with this one right here!
8050 : That wasn't a suggestion. More of an order. Well, order might be a bit harsh. Maybe request? Yes, let's go with request.
8051 : See? Now you're playing with portals! But seriously--you'll save yourself a lot of headaches down the road if you just get it over with now.
8052 : What's this? You've attuned to this spot already? Gee, you're quicker on the uptake than I'd have thought!
8053 : The pioneer way of life is difficult enough without having to worry about travel, so we set up these waypoints to make things as easy as possible.
8054 : Hut-tut! Your task isn't done yet! Find those waypoints! Gotta attune 'em all!
8055 : Let me see that thing. Maybe I can tell you which waypoints remain.
8056 : The center of Western Adoulin. That would be...right here! The place you're looking for is just in front of the Couriers' Coalition in Platea Triumphus.
8057 : I'm sure you can see it from here--that weird...no, unique...fountain over in that plaza? It's right there!
8058 : Just north of Platea Triumphus, near the airships. That's not so bad, right?
8059 : This one's located faaar away at the northern edges of Western Adoulin. My calves are burning just thinking about walking there! Well...that's what the waypoints are for!
8060 : Head north past Platea Triumphus. But don't go too far, or you'll reach the airship docks. There's this downward slope on your left along the way. That's your target!
8061 : By the waterfront, just down that slope. What would a city known for maritime trading be without a bustling waterfront?
8062 : Head straight east from Platea Triumphus. There's one located just in front of Big Bridge. If you're feeling adventurous, you can cross the bridge to reach Eastern Adoulin, where the castle is.
8063 : Hmm...take the streets to the southwest of Platea Triumphus to find this one. It's located just in front of the auction house. Promise me you won't spend all your gil when you get there, hm? After all that work you did to get here in the first place...
8064 : Let's see. There's one located to the south of Platea Triumphus. It's where the Rent-a-Rooms await for all your adventuring needs. Come to think of it, why are you asking me this? You mean you haven't even been there yet!?
8065 : This one is located southeast of Platea Triumphus. You'll find there the pride and joy of all Adoulin--the Inventors' Coalition. The road runs pretty deep there, so make sure you can find your way back out! I don't want to have to come get you!
8066 : South of Platea Triumphus, that one. You'll want to turn right along the path to the Mog Resort. You should pop by the Mummers' Coalition--that's your goal! Might as well catch some R&R while you're there, too!
8067 : So hey, congratulations on getting all the waypoints! I won't say you set a world record for speed, but it is what it is. This should make your travels through Adoulin a breeze!
8068 : By the by, have you heard of this guy Anastase?
8069 : That old fart--well, perhaps I should be respectful, because he IS my grandfather--was treated with great love and care by the people of the Middle Lands. I know you probably didn't have anything to do with that, but I just wanted to let you know how grateful I am for the kindness of your people.
8070 : Hey, how goes the whole pioneering thing? You making sure to use those waypoints? Things are tough enough out there, so no reason to make life harder on yourself!
8071 : You adjusted the waypoint with your %.
8072 : There appear to be no anomalies with this waypoint.
8073 : You there! Come to get a taste of our famous cuisine?
8074 : I'd love to give ya the house special, but hey--it's so popular that I'm completely out of ingredients to make it!
8075 : Wait...yer one of them pioneers, ain't ya? Tell ya what. You bring me some more ingredients and I'll whip up something really good.
8076 : How about it, [guy/little lady]?
8077 : Lend a hand? Sure. Food sounds good. I've got better things to do.
8078 : Too bad. Maybe later, then.
8079 : Yer a real pal! Here's what I need: # %, %, and %.
8080 : Bring me those and I'll make a shell-shocking dish like none ya ever seen!
8081 : # %, %, and %. Bring me those, and I'll be able to make ya somethin' special.
8082 : Gotta love that pioneer dependability.
8083 : Hang on just a tick. Together with what you've brought me, we add some %, %, %, and %. Plus, ya gotta heat it up just right. Not too strong, not too weak.
8084 : Aaand, we're done. My famous %. Bet yer mouth's startin' to water just lookin' at it!
8085 : It's on the house. After all, yer the one who brought me what I needed, and it was fun bein' able to make some again.
8086 : Oh-ho, made some yerself, did ya? I'm impressed.
8087 : But I really wanted to don the ol' chef's hat for this one. If ya get more ingredients, make sure to bring 'em, back to me.
8088 : Why, hello there. Here to see the loveliest lady of the Inventors' Coalition?
8089 : No? ...The Civic Arboretum sent you? Aha--you must be after some %, then.
8090 : I'm stuck at my post thanks to Amchuchu, so since you're here, mind delivering this for me? It's my own special creation.
8091 : But will vegetables grown using % really be safe to use? I mean, aren't the ones grown by Mother Nature herself the tastiest of all?
8092 : Oh, I'm not attacking the Civic Arboretum. Please don't take it that way.
8093 : If it weren't for them, people in the slums might have to go hungry.
8094 : I can vouch for the quality of these %. I would never give them anything that didn't have my seal of approval.
8095 : A good day to you, good [sir/madam]. Have you found the waypoints useful in your pioneering activities? They have been set up for your convenience, so do not hesitate to use them as you see fit.
8096 : While I have your attention--have I told you of my most oppressive grandfather, who is working with the waypoints in the Middle Lands?
8097 : The old coot will not be back for a while, so naturally I am worried about his well-being. Can I ask a small favor of you?
8098 : Listen to her story? Sure. I've got better things to do.
8099 : I see. I suppose you have no reason to help me, but...if you ever change your mind, I will be here waiting.
8100 : You have my thanks. I have prepared some traditional Adoulinian cuisine for him, as he must surely miss the fine taste of his homeland.
8101 : I am also interested in hearing how those odd fellows--his surveying party, that is--are getting along. You see, their families are stricken with worry, and I made a promise to check up on them.
8102 : Your aid is greatly appreciated. Oh dear--I forgot to tell you my grandfather's name: Anastase.
8103 : My dear pioneer, I have cooked up a lovely Adoulinian meal for my grandfather. Could I trouble you to bring it to him?
8104 : Deliver a meal for her? In a jiffy! Sorry. Too busy.
8105 : I know this may sound rude, but please do be careful with this dish, for I put all my familial love into cooking it.
8106 : My grandfather and his entourage are doing well? This is wonderful news, indeed. My gratitude knows no bounds.
8107 : I can never stop worrying about him, so I might ask you to bring some more of my home cooking to him later--if you are free, that is.
8108 : No? Sharuru? That hussy? Oh--she sent you here. I see. Then you must be interested in the %.
8109 : One moment. A little tweak here... A couple adjustments there... ...Yes. This will do nicely.
8110 : There you go--%. This should help you fix those waypoints right up!
8111 : Excuse me, [mister/ma'am]--is that a Fantastic Adoulin Imperial Liberators badge I see?
8112 : I'm Clautaire! I just joined the Liberators a couple days ago!
8113 : I wanna be a pioneer just like you someday, but my parents say I have to go to school first to learn more about the world.
8114 : For one of my class projects I'm studying about Adoulin's soil quality. Sounds fun, doesn't it?
8115 : But it's not easy. I need %, but I can't get hold of one myself...
8116 : But if you're a pioneer, it must be really easy for you, right? I'd be super happy if you could get one for me.
8117 : All I need is %. Please?
8118 : You've brought me the %! Great!
8119 : You pioneers are great! Now I'll ace my project for sure!
8120 : I go to a school established by the Order of Renaye and run by the minister of education. Because it's run by the city, it's free to everyone!
8121 : There are many poor families like mine, so I think it's great that we're able to study at such a wonderful place!
8122 : When I grow up and become a pioneer, I'll be able to help my mother live a better life.
8123 : I can't offer you too much, but maybe you'll find this useful? Either way, thank you so much for helping me!
8124 : This is Amchuchu's residence. The library sent you? Give me a look at what they want.
8125 : There's a bit more to add about the Order of Orvail. Here. Tell them to use this instead.
8126 : How is the Mummers' Coalition treating you? What? You are here on behalf of the library?
8127 : Let me see...no, I do not see anything wrong here. Let them know everything is accurate and up-to-date.
8128 : Mistress Svenja is unavailable at the moment...but you say you're here to do some research for the library?
8129 : Hmm... No, I see no problem with your records on the Order of Janniston. Carry on.
8130 : Yes, this is the manse of Reginald, maester of the Couriers' Coalition.
8131 : Your information on the Order of Shneddick is accurate, at least to the best of my knowledge. Thank you for confirming. Once you're done with that task, stop by the coalition and lend them a hand, okay?
8132 : Welcome. You're here on behalf of the library, yes?
8133 : Their records of our order appear to be complete. Thank you for coming to check.

8352 : Yeah! Arshiela was really nishe and helped me find the perfect herbsh right away!
8353 : She'sh sho brave! We kept going deeper and deeper and deeper into the woodsh...

8355 : She knew a lot about all the different typesh of herbsh, too!
8356 : Not jusht the one my grampa needed for hish cough, but onesh that make you healthy and shtuff! She taught me a lotta new thingsh in that foresht.

8360 : Thanksh for reshcuing me from thoshe evil shpiritsh, %! I thought I'd never make it back home!
8361 : Bye-bye!
8362 : Well, what have we here? Another newcomer to Adoulin!
8363 : By the look of you, I'd say you're from the Middle Lands.
8364 : Does that also mean you're one of those pioneers helping to colonize our continent?
8365 : Oh, I truly hope you are! How incredibly grand it would be to see our daring and capable frontiersmen swell in rank! I can barely contain myself thinking about adding an extra member to our cause!
8366 : Ehem. Despite my outburst of enthusiasm there, I'm not actually part of the colonization movement. If you want to sign up and make Adoulin a safer, more habitable place, head on over to the Pioneers' Coalition and speak to Brenton.
8367 : As the eighth century came to a close, so did the islands' old regime.
8368 : The royal family,  in partnership with the eleven orders, agreed to abolish imperial rule... from which arose the Sacred City of Adoulin.
8369 : The rate at which it developed astounded all. In the blink of an eye, Adoulin had become a maritime metropolis, its mercantile prowess rivaling even that of Jeuno.
8370 : The hustle and bustle of the commoners' district in the west--Adoulin's center of trade and pioneering hub--serves as a stark contrast to the refined, stoic castle in the east.
8371 : It is upon this oppidan landscape that adventurers will first leave their mark ...in the next chapter of Vana'diel's history.
8372 : Well, well, well, lookee what we've got here. %? I reckon you must be an adventurer from those Middle Lands.
8373 : Then let me be the first to welcome you to the splendiferous Sacred City of Adoulin, pardner!
8374 : Oh...I ain't your first...? I feel downright embarrassed! Although, ain't no one--especially %-carrying [guy/gal] like yourself--gonna go on a stampede 'cause of a kind word!
8375 : Enough small talk. I'm sure you want to get down to the nitty-gritty of the pioneer registration process right away.
8376 : You saw the big ol' jungle to the west of Jorius Yett, no? Bet you done seen nothin' like it!
8377 : Well, that's the area we're trying to cultivate. Upon first glance it may look like she's ripe for the pluckin', but that old bird's got quite the temper on 'er!
8378 : That's why that whopper of a gate was built long, long ago. After it went up, the number of casualties dropped faster than the first king's britches after a feast.
8379 : Jorius Yett isn't the only source of protection, though. We also issue % to pioneers so we can distinguish them from the layfolk.
8380 : With one of these humdingers, you'll be able to undertake more jobs and receive more services around Adoulin than chocobos you can shake a stick at! ...Wait, that ain't very many...
8381 : Ugh, how can I change the subject? Aha! I remember, I forgot to ask your name!
8382 : %, is it? Well, %, it seems you've passed our rigorous and discerning test! Here's your % to go along with your new pioneer status.
8383 : Just don't lose it, or the consequences will be dire. Dire, I say!
8384 : % obtained: %.
8385 : How's it feel to be one of Adoulin's roughest and toughest? Great, right? Oooh, I'm so jealous!
8386 : I guess I'll just have to be content with standing behind this here counter and informing true pioneers about all the tricks of the trade. I swear that's the only thing I'll ever do around here.
8387 : There's no need to learn them all at once, though. I know I'm a terrible chatterbox, but embarking upon a Vana'dielian Inquisition might make my jaw drop off.
8388 : So, what do you wish to know, [hombre/sweet thang]?
8389 : What do you wish to know about? The six coalitions. Coalition imprimaturs. Services and edification. Bayld. I've nothing to ask.
8390 : The jungle stretching its virid tendrils from this here city out to the west is known by the disquieting name of...Eastern Ulbuka.
8391 : I know, a jungle by any other name is still a jungle. However, we're asking you to take this overgrown deathtrap and turn it into a shining beacon of culture and civilization!
8392 : There're six coalitions that'll happily accept the rough-'n-tumble of someone willing to get their hands dirty!
8393 : Let's see if I can get them all on the first try... There's the Pioneers', the Couriers', the Inventors' Coalition...um...
8394 : ...the Scouts', the Peacekeepers', and the Mummers' Coalition.
8395 : Did I get them all? ...One...two...yeah, that's somewhere in the neighborhood of six.
8396 : Anyway, guess which of these rootin' tootin' coalitions you're inside right now?
8397 : Duhn-duh-duhhhn, the Pioneers' Coalition! It's a damn shame I can't dole out prizes for correct answers, but I will tell you that we do exactly what our name sounds like--burn the forces of nature that stand in our way to the ground with our pioneering spirit!
8398 : Next up is the Couriers' Coalition. They're responsible for carrying provisions to frontier stations and frontier bivouacs...via dragons!
8399 : If only that were true. They do transport vital resources, however, which must put a massive weight on their shoulders.
8400 : As for the Inventors' Coalition, they do indeed make things, which run the gamut from tools of the trade to newfangled provisions. Their members are much smarter than me, that's for sure.
8401 : Then there's the Scouts' Coalition, composed of the most well-informed pioneers on the continent. They make their living by collecting and distributing information, as well as by conducting surveys and research regarding Eastern Ulbuka.
8402 : We also have the few, the proud, the Peacekeepers. Their coalition concerns itself with protecting the populace of this fair city and indulging in puff pastries while on duty.
8403 : Hahaha! Boy, do I love a good guffaw! In reality, though, they're a fit bunch. They have to be, too, 'cause the Peacekeepers' and Scouts' Coalitions are on the other side of Big Bridge in Eastern Adoulin.
8404 : Last but not least, we have the Mummers' Coalition. They're even bigger cards than me, I tell you what. Those rowdy roosters are in charge of managing facilities of fun and stress-relieving functions, which sets their coalition somewhat apart from the other five.
8405 : Well, there you have it. When the powers of these six coalitions combine, they captain each and every pioneer towards colonization success! Hopefully you'll find the one that's right for you.
8406 : Here's the lowdown. The coalitions hand out these slips we call imprimaturs to pioneers.
8407 : Turning them in at your local coalition's service counter gets you off on the right foot when undertaking jobs.
8408 : This should go without saying, but let me spell it out for all those bastards thinking about duping our kindly coalitions. Absolutely no work can be given to those who do not have an imprimatur.
8409 : They don't have expiration dates, and the coalitions sure aren't going to run out of work anytime soon, so just keep an eye on your stock of them and you should be fine.
8410 : You can't call this the era of the pioneer and not give them any work! That'd be like herding lucerewes with a spatula!
8411 : What type of work, indeed... Well, I've seen them offer everything from fetching random goods from seemingly unimportant people to listening to moronic misfits blather on about love. The possibilities are damn close to endless.
8412 : No matter what the task, though, a true pioneer and coalition member will perform [his/her] duty with glee, for it can always conceivably help the colonization effort.
8413 : Speaking of help, I bit off a tad more than I could chew at the auction house the other day...
8414 : What am I thinking!? I should just get the Scouts' Coalition to dig up some dirt on the head of the auction house instead, heh heh heh...
8415 : Whoopsie daisy, where was I again?
8416 : Oh, yes. Coalition imprimaturs. I know, I know, I know. You're thinking, Why do they gotta keep us chained to a post like that? You ain't the only one complaining about it.
8417 : The thing is that the coalitions operate off capital they receive from the city, which not only funds the operation and upkeep of facilities, but also pays for pioneer compensation...
8418 : And of course, we all know that neither bayld nor gil grow on goobbues.
8419 : After the civic bigwigs decided to recruit you Middle Lands adventurers in droves, they realized they also needed a plan to corral the caravans of cash that would undoubtedly need to be paid out. You understand how shortsighted politicians are, I'm sure.
8420 : The long and the short of it is that without some way to bail us out, this place would capsize faster'n a dinghy in a tempest!
8421 : Word is that the whole system is under review by a minister of commerce-appointed subcommittee, though, so it's possible that they'll scrap the whole kit and caboodle if we rope ourselves a big'un with this pioneering project.
8422 : Yet more jargon coming up, my bushwhacking brigand. Each coalition has its own support system for pioneers.
8423 : This canopy of services grows lusher and sturdier the more money your coalition receives.
8424 : As I'm sure you've already figured out, the way to raise this metaphorical canopy is by razing real ones! Contribute to the colonization of Adoulin, get funds for your coalition, and watch it sprout before your very eyes!
8425 : What exactly does this entail for its members, you ask?
8426 : The bigger a coalition grows, the better its services become, the more lavish your headquarters will look, and the faster you'll be able to colonize the wilderness.
8427 : The more efficiently you pioneers work, the faster you'll be able to contribute to the coalition, and so the cycle repeats. In summation, helping the coalition is like helping yourself!
8428 : Oh, you want a name for this process as well? Punny you should ask, for some clever chap named it edification. Anyway, I hope you find a damn good coalition and make them proud!
8429 : After the secrets of that ubiquitous silt that's verdant as a handful of moss, are we?
8430 : For starters, it's one of our most cherished natural resources. Truly a sight to behold. If you've ever laid eyes on it, I'm sure you'll agree.
8431 : But its beauty isn't the only reason it's adored all over the continent. We also trade with it. Fine-grained granules may sound like a half-baked currency, but pioneers seem happy enough when they get paid in it or find it in Eastern Ulbuka.
8432 : I know, I know. Why not gil instead? Maybe it's a cultural thing, but bayld is all the rage in these pastures. Without it, you can't do squat here.
8433 : I guess that does it for my bayld explanation. There's probably more to say, but I don't feel much like saying it.
8434 : I find it best not to trouble my ol' noggin too much about particulars. Try living by the mantra of Be it gem or phlegm, just take 'em! when you're in the field, and everything should work out fine.
8435 : I see how it is. Don't want to hear babbling Brenton talk, do you?
8436 : Have Brenton stop babbling? Wait, I must know something! Yes, and how!
8437 : Do you now? What is it, pardner?
8438 : I understand...
8439 : I still like your face, though. Here, take this bayld as a symbol of your new life as a pioneer.
8440 : When you finally decide to leave Adoulin, present that to a guard and they'll slap Ionis on you.
8441 : It depends on how much edification the various coalitions have undergone, but Ionis should bestow different powers upon you, making your destiny seem almost manifest!
8442 : Now go out there and make me proud like the [son/daughter] I never had! I'm quaking with delight just thinking of all the amazing stories I'll be able to tell the guys down at the tavern!
8443 : What timing, %!
8444 : You've been invited to dine with the members of Adoulin's cabinet!
8445 : I'm gonna feed off this accomplishment of yours vicariously for weeks!
8446 : As real as the dickens, though, I couldn't be happier for you, %. Take this as a token of my appreciation.
8447 : Once your bison stops buckin', put on your best bib and tucker and get yourself over to Adoulin Castle.
8448 : By the way, scuttlebutt around the barnyard is that you've performed some truly courageous feats, %...
8449 : Such as felling [Colkhab, the Matriarch Naakual/Tchakka, the Riptide Naakual/Achuka, the Firebrand Naakual/Yumcax, the Ligneous Naakual/Hurkan, the Booming Naakual/Kumhau, the Flashfrost Naakual], who watches over [Ceizak Battlegrounds/Foret de Hennetiel/Morimar Basalt Fields/Yorcia Weald/Marjami Ravine/Kamihr Drifts]!
8450 : I can hardly believe there was a time when I had to teach you the ropes! It seems like we just met yesterday, yet you've already defeated # Naakual[/s]! While we Adoulinians sit quaking in our chaps, you're out whooping 'em good!
8451 : Maybe this is all in a day's work for you adventurers? I guess you've been lassoing Vana'diel's wildest afore the first bison drive.
8452 : Travelers've told many a tall tale about your exploits. I guess they weren't so tall after all...
8453 : Come to think of it, %, have you ever heard of the Naakuals?
8454 : They're the ranchers of the continent's frontier, and more temperamental than a bull in heat.
8455 : Rumors abound that the Naakuals keep thwarting the pioneers' best efforts thanks to some puppeteer or whatnot, but I've yet to see any proof in that pudding.
8456 : Either way, it seems their trails and ours are bound to cross.
8457 : You might as well learn 'em a thing or two while you're moseying about the jungle.
8458 : Tell 'em to pony up and get in line like the rest of the herd so you pioneers can lead Ulbuka to greatness!
8459 : Naakuals Start of the event. Haven't beat any. The Matriarch Naakual. The Riptide Naakual. The Ligneous Naakual. The Firebrand Naakual. The Booming Naakual. The Flashfrost Naakual.
8460 : You already adjusted to life on the good ol' Adoulin ranch? Hope so, because we're lookin' for you to wrangle us some big'uns, [sonny/missy].
8461 : Hey--it's %! Listen, I've got something juicy for you, though you may have heard already... ...It's about the leafkin.
8462 : You might've seen street vendors selling pocket-sized leafkin charms. Their popularity is simply beyond compare.
8463 : The superstitions some people will cling to... But that's neither here nor there. I bring you some interesting gossip--I've heard that they have a gathering spot of sorts in Yorcia Weald. Have you ever been there?
8464 : Have you been to there? Yes. What a sight to behold. No. But it sounds interesting...
8465 : You have! All the better.
8466 : There are whispers going around about a regal matriarch who rules over them all. Are you familiar with the story?
8467 : Do you know of their queen? Of course. What a story! Umm...does she have a crown?
8468 : %, your knowledge really has no bounds!
8469 : They're only rumors, %! How am I supposed to know? If she really does exist, though, she must have some wonderful stories to tell.
8470 : Then your first goal is to find where they live. There's something I'd like you to do for me when you arrive.
8471 : You must be aware of recent...abnormalities in the forest, being a pioneer and all.
8472 : Those leafkin buggers are deeply intertwined with nature, so they could assist in getting to the root of the problem. Haha. Root. I kill me.
8473 : The problem is that none of them speak the common tongue...none, that is, except for the queen. I mean, if monarchs are supposedly deities incarnate, I'd certainly expect them to have a leg up on their followers.
8474 : You're gonna make me spell it out, aren't you?
8475 : I want you to find and approach the queen and then seek her advice.
8476 : We need to learn more about what's wrong with the forest. The rivers are running dry, the flora is changing at a dizzying rate...and worse.
8477 : Some have even reported hearing unnaturally feral screams thundering across the land. Such an ill portent for our pioneering activities.
8478 : None to date have succeeded in meeting her, though not for lack of trying.
8479 : If she exists, she certainly wouldn't trust us. There must be some way we can open her heart, though the details escape me.
8480 : If it were a mere question of words, then we would just send a city envoy to parlay with her. No, it's got to be something more material.
8481 : To meet with the queen, you'll have to earn the trust of her tribe. I wish I could offer you more clues, but those are all the hints I can give you.
8482 : So what do you say? Feeling up to the challenge?
8483 : Find the leafkin queen? Yes. What an adventure! Leaves scare me.
8484 : Outstanding! Adoulin is counting on you, %!
8485 : That's a damn shame. I'd advise you to think about what this could mean for the city and come back to me once you've changed your mind.
8486 : How about it, %? Have you rethought my proposition of finding the leafkin queen?
8487 : We need information more than anything else--no use going in blind. You might be able to find out something at the Mummers' Coalition, what with all the pioneers coming and going.
8488 : (Not like I can say for sure...)
8489 : Hmm? Oh, pay my ramblings no heed. Goddessspeed, %!
8490 : %! Why such a sour look on your face?
8491 : It is wholly unbecoming. But please, I am more than willing to lend an ear if it would help absolve you of your worries. I have got all the time in the world, after all.
8492 : So tell me--what troubles you this fine day?
8493 : What would you like to discuss? Meeting the leafkin queen.
8494 : Ah, yes. Her Royal Highness, if you will. Should you have the time, I would enjoy nothing more than to regale you with some relevant tales of old.
8495 : But before I do... Have you had the fortune--or perhaps misfortune--of tussling with one of the Naakuals?
8496 : Excellent. Your skill matches your tough demeanor. I should expect nothing less from one who has crossed swords with them.
8497 : I am certain you have at least heard of their existence.
8498 : Guardians of Ulbuka--her wrath made manifest. If you wish to progress into the wilds, locking horns is inevitable.
8499 : Be that as it may, I promised you a story, and a story you shall have. Having spent many days and nights in Adoulin, you have surely heard the name of the founder king spoken by noble and peasant alike.
8500 : The trials and tribulations of centuries past are naught but legends to people living today. This story involves one of these legends.
8501 : The foolhardy king ventured into the wilds with his entourage, invading the lands of Ulbuka and slaughtering all foes in his path.
8502 : Though his blade sliced through the flesh of many like strands of silk, a few particularly lurid beasts--those that now serve as keepers of the wilds--were not to be tamed so easily. When they were at last bested, they swore fealty to the founder king.
8503 : Today, we refer to them as the Naakuals.
8504 : He subjugated one race after another, eventually breaching the sanctity of the forest's most inner recesses.
8505 : Yet something caused him to abandon his goal of colonization.
8506 : Years later, he left the following words as he lay on his deathbed: Never again must man tread upon the land of Ulbuka.
8507 : This epithet has been known throughout Adoulin's history as the Ancient Pact.
8508 : The Naakuals are bound by this very pact--but they are not the only ones. Do you see where I am heading?
8509 : Well, do you? So you mean the leafkin...?
8510 : Precisely!
8511 : You see, %, the leafkin do not look kindly on mankind's encroachment upon Ulbuka, as it violates the word and spirit of the sacred deal they made with the founder king. Its power is absolute.
8512 : The only one who can nullify the pact would be the founder king himself...or one of his bloodline.
8513 : It was not comparatively long ago that man respected this code to the same degree as the denizens of the forest... When the Order of Adoulin was a royal force superceding all, that is.
8514 : His dying wishes were also engraved upon the sword that he once carried at his side.
8515 : Throughout the centuries, each king of Adoulin had held the sword high in front of his subjects, swearing to uphold his ancestor's grand promise.
8516 : Your eyes widen in surprise. I assure you, every last syllable is steeped in truth.
8517 : Throughout all of Adoulin's history, her citizens only set foot in Ulbuka on two occasions.
8518 : The first, of course, was when the founder king himself treaded upon the land. The second was in an age called the Great Expedition, a time when the founder king's words had begun to fade from memory.
8519 : The remnants of the encampments set up during that time still exist to this day on the shoreline of the eastern sea.
8520 : Forgive me--my story has veered off in an unexpected direction. As I was explaining, throughout time, Adoulin's rulers have always respected the pact.
8521 : Whenever a new king ascended, he would take hold of the sword and swear a solemn oath to uphold that which had been passed down through the ages.
8522 : Yet winds of change started to sweep the city, and the Order of Adoulin was reorganized into one of twelve noble houses.
8523 : When Ygnas, the current leader of the Order of Adoulin, came to power, he was just one man in charge of his house--his influence over the city muted at best.
8524 : He chose to abandon the sword, declaring that the colonization of Ulbuka was to recommence--a stance not taken in well more than two dozen generations.
8525 : Thus, a new age dawned upon the city--one of pioneering and progress.
8526 : So if he foresook the blade of his forefathers, into whose hands did it fall?
8527 : Think hard, dear %. The one who possesses it is the one closest to Ygnas himself--one present at his coronation.
8528 : In fact, you have laid eyes upon the blade on more than one occasion.
8529 : Who is the bearer of the blade? It must be Arciela!
8530 : The sword that our princess now wields is the only thing that represents the will of the founder king himself.
8531 : I profess that I have a tendency to ramble, but I assume this tale served to scatter the clouds of doubt that were surely muddling your thoughts.
8532 : Think of it as a tidbit of wisdom from someone with idle hands and tongue.
8533 : At my age, dreams are a thing of the past...as they have been for decades upon decades.
8534 : Sometimes I catch myself thinking about the founder king. All he wanted was to catch dreams in his hands.
8535 : And so he reached out into the depths of the forest, attempting to seize what no man had ever touched.
8536 : At least, so go the stories that they tell.
8537 : You adventurers cling to your desires in much the same way. No. Forget what I just told you and leave me to my wanderings.
8538 : Hey, welcome back! Did you manage to find out anything?
8539 : The founder king's sword? Oh, you mean the one that Princess Arciela always keeps at her side.
8540 : You know how it happened to come into her possession? Ygnas bequeathed it to her when he ascended to his current station.
8541 : To think that such a blade would be a relic of centuries past...
8542 : She guards it like a protective mother would guard her son. Never once has anyone seen her without it.
8543 : You want to borrow it!? Are you out of your mind?
8544 : It must be really important for you to say something so brash.
8545 : Oh ho, so that's the rub--you think the leafkin will trust you if you have that sword.
8546 : Not that I expect her to give it up like some piece of hard candy, but if you want to try, you can find the princess in Castle Adoulin.
8547 : Sure, it might be like wringing blood from a stone, but it's at least worth a shot! It's the only way to figure out what's going wrong with the land!
8548 : So, hey...there've been rumors you were spotted together with Arciela in the jungle. (For Altana's sake, didn't I tell [him/her] to find Arciela at the castle, not by traipsing about Ulbuka?)
8549 : Well, that'll teach me to go sticking my nose into things. Just go along with your business.
8550 : <Mumble> <murmur> This ain't it, neither...
8551 : What'm I doin'? Just pinin' for th' days of old, I tell you what.
8552 : It's all 'cause of somethin' that done happened three score years afore. An adventurer from the Middle Lands--much like yourself[/...'cept he was a guy]--let me partake of the mightiest-tasting bev'rage that's ever tickled my tongue.
8553 : The fruit it was squeezed from had more bumps and blemishes than an octogenarian, and its snot-green color didn't make it look any more appealing. Its innards, however, they was the most molten shade of passionate red I've ever done seen. If it'd had blood, it would've been boiling.
8554 : But the flavor's what really did ya in. Sweet like your first kiss, and sour like the moment her daddy caught ya.
8555 : It went down smooth, too. Smoother'n a used chocobo salesman, but wit' none o' th' grease.
8556 : Sixty years later, though, and I'm on my deathbed.
8557 : Ain't got no wife no more, never wanted no dirty kids, and my best years are so far behind me that they've fallen and can't get up. All I've got left to comfort me now is the unforgettable taste of that drink.
8558 : Nothin's ever made me feel so alive, so...satisfied.
8559 : If only I'd had the wherewithal to ask what the name of that fruit was...
8560 : Wait a dadgum minute. As an adventurer, you ain't just been to the Middle Lands, but all differ'nt parts o' Vana'diel, right?
8561 : If you ever get your hands on one and pass it thisaway, I'd die a happy man.
8562 : Let the man die happy? Sure, I'll search for it. If I can't be happy, no one can.
8563 : Its peel's all lumpy and green to the point of inducing vomit, but the fruit itself's as heartwarmingly red as my wife of forty years was...<sob>.
8564 : <Sniff> Anyway, my life's so sad that a fruit's the best thing in it. Please, bring me this one bit o' joy.
8565 : ...Fine. I know, who'd want to help a man so old that he probably dreamed up the whole fruit bev'rage memory anyway. Ugh, life...
8566 : Just the memory of that drink's sublime flavor comforts me in the wee hours of the night while I'm up regrettin' the choices I've made.
8567 : I do not believe we have met before. My name is Teodor.
8568 : And you are...?
8569 : %, is it?
8570 : That name is certainly a rarity on this continent. I take it you were born on the other side of the sea?
8571 : Hmmm... An adventurer from the Middle Lands, come to assist in the colonization movement. How altruistic.
8572 : I cannot express how comforting it is to lay eyes on your visage once more, %.
8573 : Have you been enjoying your little romp through the wilderness of fair Ulbuka? It simply would not do for you to come all the way here and not indulge in what we have to offer. Life is long and terribly dull, so you must seize any opportunities to appreciate it when they present themselves.
8574 : The only issue is that no matter how interesting the diversions, they rarely stand the test of time. That is why novelty matters the most in such affairs.
8575 : This metaphorical freshness preserves not only one's sanity, but his youth as well. Of the mind, that is. That of the body is an entirely separate matter.
8576 : I see that this drink in my hand does a far better job at holding your attention than my dusty old words. It is a concoction made with the juice of a certain fruit that grows deep within the Ulbukan jungle.
8577 : I profess that it is one of my favorite beverages, but alas, the fruit that gives birth to it is rare and highly unobtainable.
8578 : Simply look at this ruddy hue that mimics a bleeding sunset. And the piquant aroma that delicately tickles one's nose.
8579 : I can hardly picture the look of shock that must have crossed the face of the person who first discovered it, seeing how its outward appearance resembles a ball of hardened phlegm hocked carelessly onto the ground by a terminally ill old man.
8580 : Sources do tell me that pioneers have been making a habit of bringing some back with them, but the fruit rarely makes it to conventional mercantile channels, as this shopkeep tells me his stocks are bone-dry.
8581 : Have you succumbed to the temptations of this luscious fruit as well, my dear %?
8582 : Then I suggest paying a visit to the Couriers' Coalition, as it is they who keep watch over the innumerable goods that make their way into and out of this nation.
8583 : I assume you wish to trek there with utmost haste, and therefore will refrain from keeping you much longer.
8584 : You did not come here looking to engage in idle chitchat, nor would I dare to dampen the spirits of a fellow sensualist.
8585 : Until we meet again, %, for I have a feeling that this is not the last we will see of each other.
8586 : Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your chocobos! You do realize that it's almost impossible to give you information on all the fruit harvested from the jungle this past year, right?
8587 : Hmmm. I see.
8588 : If that's the case, then you're looking for %.
8589 : It originated from...where was it, again? Oh yes, the Middle Lands. A traveler who ventured to the Middle Lands brought it back with him when he returned.
8590 : The tree he planted out in the woods has been bearing fruit since the time of the Great Expedition, people say.
8591 : There used to be fields and gardens that extended deep into the interior of the continent. I guess some survived after we Adoulinians fell back behind Jorius Yett.
8592 : Even if they do sell for a high price, I know I'd never go foraging for them. It's simply too high a risk for the rate of return.
8593 : Still, I can see the appeal. They don't grow in the Middle Lands anymore, so there is definitely a market for them.
8594 : If you were to raise a plant all by yourself and then sell its yield abroad, you'd earn yourself a hefty profit for sure.
8595 : Come to think of it, I recall hearing that the Civic Arboretum bought up all the remaining ones.
8596 : If that's the case, I'm certain there aren't any left. There's no way those botanophiles would let one slip through their thorny fingers.
8597 : Sorry I couldn't be any more of a help to you.
8598 : I'd best be getting back to work now. Good luck in your search.
8599 : Oooh, the lumpy green snot fruit of my youth! How'd ya manage t' find it?
8600 : In Yahse Hunting Grounds!? Talk about it being right under my nose the whole time! Too bad it was too stuffed with regrets from the past decades to sniff it out.
8601 : This isn't the time to be wallowing in self-doubt! There's ambrosia t' drink here!
8602 : ...Hmmm, that's not the flavor I've been longin' for, I tell you what.
8603 : The fruit looks the same, but it ain't got that telltale flavor.
8604 : Must be differ'nces in the soil that done it. Ulbuka's never been the most conducive land t' farmin'.
8605 : You sayin' that 'cause there ain't be no more trees for it in the Middle Lands, I ain't never gettin' to taste the fruit like 'twas when I was younger?
8606 : So much for dying happy...
8607 : ...Wait.
8608 : After tasting it again, dare I say this ain't half bad!
8609 : Odd... Despite bein' reared under harsh conditions on this toughest of continents...it's like my grandma dripped honey down on it from the heavens!
8610 : This could be even easier t' drink than the one I remember.
8611 : Yes. Let me say it loud and proud. This is one fine bev'rage!
8612 : %, I can't thank you enough. This whole time I'd been living in the past, tryin' to reclaim somethin' I couldn't...but you've opened my eyes.
8613 : Just like how this new Ulbukan-grown fruit tastes better than the original, maybe what lies ahead of me ain't some inevitable march to the gallows!
8614 : Of course everyone's gotta meet their maker eventually, but that's no reason t' give up!
8615 : My purpose for living could be hidin' in the Yahse Hunting Grounds, too...or anywhere, even. All I need is a little rainwater and some quality soil to sink my roots into and start growin'.
8616 : You said somethin' about how young'uns down in them sewers was tryin' t' grow these on their own, didn'chya?
8617 : That gets me thinkin'...about how I can taste that heavenly flavor again...and how I wanna contribute t' Adoulin.
8618 : I hope my dear departed wife ain't get mad at me none for not keepin' her in my head ever' minute of the day, but I think I've found my life's callin'.
8619 : I'ma head on over to that Arboretum and lend an old, wrinkly hand in raisin' those crops, for certain.
8620 : I wouldn't have come t' this realization without ya, %. This ain't worth the inspiration ya've given me, but at least it comes from the heart--the heart of a man born again.
8621 : If a particularly piquant fruit is what you're in search of, I suggest heading over to the Couriers' Coalition.
8622 : No need to thank me. I'm sure you'll return the favor in due time. You are a pioneer, after all.
8623 : Researchers from the Civic Arboretum bought the total remaining stock of %, if what I've heard is to be believed.
8624 : %! Perfect timing, as always.
8625 : I've heard you made an appearance at one of the ruling class's post-colloquy banquets, have you not?
8626 : Well, that certainly would explain it.
8627 : And with the way you've been cozying up to our dear princess of late, it only makes sense...
8628 : Let me share with you something juicy. Ingrid of the Order of Weatherspoon is due to return to Adoulin from a brief sojourn to the Middle Lands.
8629 : Don't be fooled by her fair complexion and youthful attire--she is one of the order's most respected exorcists, with capabilities far beyond her years.
8630 : Inquire about what? What's an exorcist? Never heard of them. ...
8631 : You got rocks for brains? Let me see if I can explain this in the simplest terms possible.
8632 : Undead: bad. No undead: good.
8633 : I suppose it is a bit more complicated than that. An exorcist is a white mage who focuses not on the path of rest and respite, but rather on smiting the wicked with divine fury.
8634 : All Adoulinian tots learn that these conjurers have their roots in the sorcerous studies of the first head of Weatherspoon.
8635 : As is often seen, techniques were passed from progenitor to progeny, proving useful time and again until the citizenry of our fair city bore the exorcists naught but respect.
8636 : A little Holy here, a little Banish there, and bam!
8637 : Throughout the ages, there have always been exorcists with strong connections to the Order of Weatherspoon.
8638 : Is that the reason why undead do not accost our fair city? The world may never know.
8639 : You know how foot soldiers guard bigwigs? That's the role exorcists play here in Adoulin.
8640 : The leader of these spiritualists-turned-soldiers is the high exorcist, Vortimere--an enigma to much of the city. What I am about to tell you comes directly from his lips.
8641 : Have any questions? So Ingrid is an exorcist? What would Ingrid want with me?
8642 : Were you paying attention to a word I said? She's the creme de la creme of our prestigious exorcist chantry.
8643 : Doesn't that just beat all!
8644 : Right. As I mentioned, Ingrid is the most accomplished exorcist around. That is high praise in and of itself...
8645 : ...But she's also drop-dead gorgeous!
8646 : Her personality is, however, a bit...how can I put this... Abrasive?
8647 : One tenet of an exorcist's creed is that the wicked shall know no succor, and Ingrid takes this to such an extreme that the less diplomatic call her Ingrid the Merciless.
8648 : But let's keep that just between us.
8649 : Inquire about what? What would Ms. Merciless want with me? Ingrid the Merciless?
8650 : H-have you gone completely mad!? Don't say that too loud, or they'll come for me, too!
8651 : If your aim was to chop five years off my life, you've done an admirable job.
8652 : But back to the matter at hand. Ingrid expressed the desire to see more of the world, so she made a pilgrimage of sorts to the Middle Lands.
8653 : But something urgent came up, and she is now en route back to Adoulin.
8654 : Vortimere would have you take a stroll down to the airship docks and greet Ingrid when she arrives.
8655 : Perhaps you're wondering why he chose you.
8656 : To be honest, I asked myself the same thing. It must not be my place to know.
8657 : But a request is a request, and here we find ourselves talking this lovely day.
8658 : Once she arrives, you are to accompany her to Adoulin Castle.
8659 : Yes, the castle. Not the Order of Weatherspoon manse.
8660 : It vexes me, too, but Vortimere said to escort her directly there.
8661 : Will you greet Ingrid? A real exorcist? Yes! I'm a bit busy right now...
8662 : I'm sure her vessel will arrive at any moment, so you'd best hurry. She certainly would not take kindly to being kept waiting.
8663 : I've made sure she knows who to look for, and I'll send word to the castle so they'll be expecting you.
8664 : Off you go, then!
8665 : You've got better things to do!? B-but...she'll be here any time now!
8666 : Do you know what she'll do to me if someone isn't there to meet her?! Oh, please, please reconsider!
8667 : B-besides, with people as important as the Twelve Orders waiting for you, Vortimere will skin me alive if you aren't there when she arrives...alone!
8668 : %! Here about my request?
8669 : You must be %.
8670 : Yes, your name is known to me. As you have no doubt surmised, I am Ingrid of the Order of Weatherspoon.
8671 : How will you address her? You mean Ingrid the Merciless?
8672 : Ingrid the Merciless?
8673 : And here I thought only natives of Adoulin called me that.
8674 : Pray tell, who did you hear that from? Go on, I promise not to be angry.
8675 : It is of little consequence. Long have I known people call me by that moniker.
8676 : But let me ask you this--why should any mercy be shown to those who have turned their backs on the Goddess?
8677 : Let all Adoulin be in accord--I am merciless through and through!
8678 : All who face my judgment shall not even have one speck of ash left!
8679 : What is the calling of an exorcist if not to obliterate the defiled from the face of Adoulin?
8680 : And I will not stop here. No, I intend on the name Ingrid the Merciless being rung throughout the Middle Lands as well!
8681 : But I have no time for idle chatter. I must make haste to Castle Adoulin.
8682 : Nor do I need you to take me there.
8683 : Why? Petulant child. Because I am the chosen girl of the Order of Weatherspoon!
8684 : What will you ask? Girl? Just how old are you?
8685 : It is not your place to ask such questions.
8686 : Are all Middle Landers as oblivious to societal mores as you?
8687 : As I said earlier--enough prattling. I have visited the castle countless times in the past.
8688 : You haven't heard anything about my mission, have you?
8689 : Have you heard about her mission? Not one whit. I've only heard about your beauty...
8690 : Then you must also be unaware of what precipitates my return.
8691 : I, the greatest exorcist in all of Ulbuka, was summoned back because of none other than...
8692 : The black sheep of Adoulin himself.
8693 : I heard word about him becoming cursed into some pitiable form.
8694 : Cooler heads always prevail--and thus it falls to me to see if this nonsense is true.
8695 : The missive I received stated that the founder king's curse has been made manifest, but I have my doubts.
8696 : I should not be so outwardly skeptical. If Vortimere says it is a curse, then...it probably is.
8697 : <Sigh> And yet again, it falls to someone else to clean up one of Ygnas's messes.
8698 : I thought he had his head on straight until he started this colonization nonsense, but now...
8699 : That matters little at this juncture. Pandora's box has been opened, and Vortimere is right--we must see this through to its natural conclusion.
8700 : Unlike Hildebert, who views it as an abominable farce, I know that it's the direction we are headed in, for good or for ill.
8701 : Any comments? Who's Hildebert? Of course--that old guy. ...
8702 : Hildebert is the head of my order, always wearing those painfully crisp white outfits of his.
8703 : Your question surprises me. Your name is known amongst the Twelve Orders, so I imagined you would have met him before.
8704 : Pray listen, adventurer.
8705 : You must understand, having come to our fair city to serve as a pioneer of your own volition.
8706 : No matter what barriers stand before us, we must resolve to destroy them at any cost.
8707 : Our aim is to press onwards, even if we must violently uproot them.
8708 : Just as our ancestors did during the Great Expedition.
8709 : Are you familiar with this time in Adoulin's history?
8710 : Have you heard of the Great Expedition? O-of course! The what, now?
8711 : Your answer does not convince me, but I am loath to tell you something you may already know.
8712 : Those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it. Pay a visit to % and become versed in the history of our fair city.
8713 : <Mutter> Cursed foreigners cannot even respect the land they are in...
8714 : Allow me to give you a brief lesson. Colonization was attempted an additional time after the founder king's first foray all those years ago.
8715 : Several centuries past, there was another effort to pioneer the mainland.
8716 : This period of history is known as The Great Expedition.
8717 : The words of the founder king grew faint over time. And what do you think happened?
8718 : A struggle for power between the orders.
8719 : It was a time of unbridled strife and conflict. Each order attempted to seize power, and the ground turned red with blood as they feverishly rushed to populate the mainland.
8720 : History is always seen through the eyes of the victor. But as each order considered themselves the winner, we have no fewer than twelve whitewashed versions of what really happened.
8721 : Those who regale you with these tales of bravery and bravado are completely blind to the corruption of the darkness--no, they actively turn their backs to it.
8722 : Those of Ulbuka who took one cautious step into the wilds suffered at the claws of the dread spirits and demons that appeared as if from the underworld.
8723 : And while the squabbling took place in the city proper, who was it that rose above the madness to save our kin? The exorcists!
8724 : Humanity has no future if it lives in constant fear of demons and curses!
8725 : Forgive me for boring you. It is not my place to bring internal struggles to your ears.
8726 : I know you are here for one reason, and one reason alone--money. As long as you remember not to get in our way, you can expect an amiable relationship with me.
8727 : But while I have your attention...
8728 : I have heard other curious things about you--namely, that you are able to converse with our dear grand chancellor despite his current state.
8729 : Well, that certainly is something!
8730 : This may sound crass, but no one is interested in you as a person. They are interested in what you--and this strange power--can do for us.
8731 : Your task is to interpret for me. For that reason, and that reason alone, I shall tolerate your presence.
8732 : Come. They are waiting.
8733 : Did you see that beauty who just arrived at the docks? A shame that her heart isn't as pristine as her skin.
8734 : Normal folk can't ride the ships without a special permit. She completely threw the schedule out of whack when she demanded to board, and the crew had to bend over backwards to accommodate her.
8735 : Every rose has its thorns--but some have more than others.
8736 : Come to think of it, weren't you supposed to take her to the castle? Then quit skulking about here and get to it!
8737 : Huh? You want a piece of stone wall touched by the light of dawn?
8738 : Something about an exorcist ritual, you say? Well, I'm pretty sure you've come to the right place.
8739 : But there are lots of stones. Which would be touched by light?
8740 : I know where you could look! There's a grand lighthouse over to the east. Back in the day, people called it the Sunrise Beacon.
8741 : The place you're looking for is the Sunrise Beacon, on the east side of the waterfront.
8742 : %! Tell me, how goes the pioneering?
8743 : Good to hear. But since you're here, there's something that's been bothering me.
8744 : It's about our beloved princess.
8745 : The color's drained from her face, and she just mopes about everywhere she goes. She had always been so chipper and upbeat before this.
8746 : You're pretty close with her, right? Do you have any idea what could be wrong?
8747 : Any idea what's wrong? Of course. Not really.
8748 : I just knew it! I would ask of you a favor, then.
8749 : If you don't know, then it's no wonder I haven't the foggiest. Something's eating away at her. Do you think her brother's ill?
8750 : It's been so long since any of us have seen him.
8751 : Let's cut to the quick. Just now, someone saw Arciela wandering off to the %.
8752 : Her eyes were all glazed over and unfocused--I'm worried where she'll stumble off to...and what might find her when she gets there.
8753 : You must surely be concerned for her well-being, too.
8754 : And it's not just the two of us. She's always been a presence here in the city, and with the way she sort of sticks out...
8755 : Doesn't matter if you're in favor of or opposed to this whole colonization affair. Some people love her, and others hate her.
8756 : And so, if I could ask of you a favor. Nothing that would take too much of your time--I just want you to go talk to the princess.
8757 : You're on good terms with her, and without her it seems as if the people are lost.
8758 : That has me just as worried.
8759 : This isn't official coalition business, but would you mind seeing if there's anything you can do for her?
8760 : Of course, I know you will. Isn't that right?
8761 : Go help Arciela? Yes...of course. Like I have any choice.
8762 : I knew I could count on you, %!
8763 : I heard the princess stumbled her way to the %. Head there and see if you can take her mind off things.
8764 : It'sh %! It'sh %!
8765 : There you are, and just in the nick of time! This little sprite here kept saying she wouldn't leave my side until she met you, and I'm at wits' end.
8766 : She tells me you found some medicine for her grandfa--
8767 : Long time no shee, %!
8768 : How'sh my grampa doing?
8769 : Thanksh to that nishe lady and her shpeshal shtuff, it doeshn't shound like he'sh coughing up a tempesht anymore!
8770 : I jusht wanted to thank you onshe more in pershon!
8771 : Ummm...thanksh a lot, %!
8772 : Too bad the nishe lady ishn't here. I wanted to thank her for all the touching thingsh she did for me in thoshe shcary woodsh.
8773 : ...I guessh I'll never be able to shee her, though, now that she's a prinshessh.
8774 : ...At least that'sh what my grampa shaid.
8775 : But if you shee her, can you pleashe give her my re...re...regardsh? Pretty pleashe with sugar on top!?
8776 : I think you've got the wrong idea, missy. She's-- Hey, come back!
8777 : ...Oh, well. There's no use chasing after her just to explain.
8778 : I know we use princess as a term of endearment for her, but I don't think you could even use the phrase constitutional monarchy to describe Adoulin these days. The king himself abolished royal rule long ago.
8779 : I suppose such concepts soar far above the head of a pixie like her, anyway.
8780 : Now that I won't be interrupted...you and Arciela found some herbs for that girl's grandfather, correct? Apparently, they're harder to come by than an orobon in the basalt fields.
8781 : Count your lucky stars that the princess is so knowledgeable about plant life... Come to think of it, I haven't heard about any of her woodland escapades recently.
8782 : I don't mean to pry, but how's she faring?
8783 : How is Arciela faring? I spoke to her in the library. She's got a sweet tooth. I asked about guys and what she's into...
8784 : I see. So, she was thoroughly absorbed in her research and not particularly talkative, then?
8785 : A sweet tooth? Could she perhaps have been worried about them decaying and blemishing her lovely smile? Or maybe she's more concerned about her waistline expanding?
8786 : You mud-mouthed cur! How dare you speak so dirty to a lady so pure!?
8787 : Hmmm... At least it sounds like she was in good spirits.
8788 : Those in support of the colonization movement have not been kind to Arciela, due to her reserved stance on the matter.
8789 : On the other hand, her journeys into the wilderness do not go over well with her more traditionalist constituents. They fear her much as they would a witch.
8790 : Perhaps things would be different if she settled in with a single faction instead of taking the high road and treating everyone as equals. Still, there are people in the Pioneers' Coalition who think the world of her.
8791 : ...Just like that little girl who ran off a few moments ago.
8792 : My point is that Arciela may feel alone, but she's not. As our representative, stick by her through thick and thin so she knows just how important she is to this city!
8793 : Well, if it isn't %! Come looking for more trouble, no doubt. Wish I had something for you to do, but my slate's as clean as the waters of Fontis Xanira. But wait...you're not really here to see me, are you?
8794 : Are you here to see him? No, I'm looking for someone. Yes, I came to give my regards.
8795 : Oh, c'mon now. All our conversations are business-related. Why would this be any different? You know I'd be happy to tell you anything I can.
8796 : Another one of your manhunts, is it?
8797 : Teodor, you say?
8798 : Oh, right--that old fuddy-duddy who's always dressed like he's headed for a funeral.
8799 : Funny you should mention him. One of my buddies who fancies himself adept at games of chance was talking the guy up a few days back.
8800 : Something about counting cards and loaded dice...bah. I tuned him out. But if you're looking for Teodor, I'd check at the Mummers' Coalition.
8801 : Besides, with that dour look plastered on your face, you could probably use a bit of relaxation.
8802 : Altana loves all her children, but it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that expression makes even her think twice about giving you guidance.
8803 : Off you go. Let your hair down and gamble away some bayld. Everyone needs an escape now and again.
8804 : I'll even give you a little bit so you don't have to worry about spending your hard-earned bayld.
8805 : I don't get enough time off here, so I'm counting on you to have enough fun for the both of us!
8806 : That ol' Teodor fella has been milling about the Mummers' Coalition since Arciela was knee-high to a leafkin. No doubt you'll find him there.
8807 : While you're there, use my bayld to bring a smile to your face. Wish I could go along, too...but I'm stuck here for a while longer.
8808 : Well, well, my dearest %. Pray tell, how went everything with the young lady you were after?
8809 : Oh ho, you say you teamed up with our fair princess? The two of you have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
8810 : But enough small talk. What can I do for you today?
8811 : I presume you did not approach me simply to stare at my impeccably groomed moustache.
8812 : What will you ask? Can you help with the Ygnas issue? Well, you do look quite dapper...
8813 : Come, now, we both know that is not why you are really here.
8814 : Ah. Bit of a hot-button issue these days. Well, we have had our fair share of dealings of late, and of course I'm inclined to help you...
8815 : Hmm... To be frank, I have grown bored with my lot of late.
8816 : And all things have their price. As an adventurer, you must understand--treasure means more when you overcome adversity to obtain it. In exchange for my aid, I would ask that you play a game with me.
8817 : No, no, I promise there shall be no riddles this time. I propose a mere game of chance. Say...Boom or Bust?
8818 : One round would leave too much to chance, however... ...I know. We shall make it a best-of-five affair. Should you emerge the victor, I will aid you in whatever you seek.
8819 : Take him up on his offer? Lady Luck's smilin' on me! Not when I come up snake eyes... What's Boom or Bust?
8820 : Getting cold feet? I expected better out of you.
8821 : Ahhh, I understand. You wish to refine your technique before entering the ring.
8822 : Not that I blame you--I do have quite the reputation around these tables. I shall be waiting here should you change your mind.
8823 : No need to rush your way to defeat. I will be here when you are ready to try your hand.
8824 : Feel better now that you have gotten accustomed to the dice?
8825 : I cannot fault you for wanting to try your hand first.
8826 : Permit me to explain the rules of the game to you.
8827 : Boom or Bust is a dice game in which each player competes to get their dice closer to eleven than the other.
8828 : Either you or your opponent may choose to shoot and roll the dice, stay and do nothing, or pick from three tricks up your sleeve.
8829 : The three tricks in your arsenal of deception include Sneak Peek, which allows you to see your opponent's shots, using the old Switcheroo and trading shots with your opponent, or forcing your opponent to reroll a shot of his choice with Crooked Die.
8830 : These three tricks will spin the wheel of fortune in your favor, but it is precisely because of their immense powers that we must limit their use to once per game.
8831 : Make sure you attempt to turn the tables at the right time, or Lady Luck will be the one cleaning house.
8832 : You look a little pale, %. Feeling the pressure?
8833 : Haha, I jest. This is just a game between friends, so there is no need for you to stiffen up like a day-old loaf of bread.
8834 : The time for talk is over. Let us see whom fortune favors!
8835 : Come now, %, it is wholly unlike you to throw in the towel so easily.
8836 : This may be a friendly contest, but I assure you I will pull no punches. I would implore you to do the same.
8837 : A hollow victory over an apathetic foe leaves a taste no better than defeat. Do not disappoint me!
8838 : It is all skill...and a little luck. Who does Altana favor this day?
8839 : Close your eyes for one second, and the tables will turn inexorably against you...
8840 : Yet we remain spurred on by the promise of victory, and our hearts race at the thought of agonizing defeat. Could you think of a better way to spend your time, %?
8841 : Well, well... How about this?
8842 : Come on, come on... Daddy needs a new pair of sabatons!
8843 : To advance or retreat... May fate decide!
8844 : What to do...what to do... Bring it home!
8845 : Hoho, feeling the heat?
8846 : Aha...
8847 : Are you sure about that?
8848 : All part of the plan.
8849 : Wha--!
8850 : Learned something, have we?
8851 : You may think you have the upper hand now, but I wouldn't cash in those chips just yet...!
8852 : Tricky, are you not?
8853 : The battle has just begun!
8854 : Try this on for size!
8855 : Hmm...hmm...
8856 : Time for me to step up.
8857 : Teodor used the old switcheroo! His # has been exchanged with your #, and your total is now #.
8858 : Teodor forces you to shoot again! Your shot for turn number # is now #, and your total is now #.
8859 : Your record for this match is currently #-#-#.
8860 : Altana smiles on me this round! For a moment, I thought I might break a sweat.
8861 : The day is still young, %! Keep your chin up, and perhaps your luck will turn around.
8862 : I must admit to taking an interest in your skill--but 'tis too early to raise the white flag!
8863 : Even Steven--that is what they call it, hmm?
8864 : I need to close this out before things get ugly...
8865 : I refuse to yield so easily! Off with the gloves!
8866 : You may have the edge now, but do not expect it to last long!
8867 : To the victor go the spoils, %! Let Lady Luck decide our fortunes!
8868 : It appears we have battled to a standstill! [And to think, victory was within my grasp./Even the friendliest of games demands honest competition./That certainly was a heated affair!] On to the next one!
8869 : Congratulations, my friend! With the look on your face, I was not sure you would make it...
8870 : Hmm? Pay my ramblings no heed, %. What is it you wished to discuss?
8871 : A most unfortunate turn of events for you, %.
8872 : We had a deal--no victory, no discussion. I wish you better luck on your next go at it.
8873 : Come back for another try? Far be it from me to turn down a challenge.
8874 : About Ygnas...I see.
8875 : Mmm-hmm... Is that so? I think I understand.
8876 : What you truly seek is the reason why Ygnas pointed his twig of a finger at his younger sister.
8877 : Why, the answer is so obvious that I am amazed you came to me at all.
8878 : Think, %. Was he really pointing at Arciela, or...something else?
8879 : I am sure he would be loath to point at another, as it goes against the very basics of etiquette.
8880 : Begging your pardon, but would you do me the favor of pointing at me?
8881 : See, %? Like that.
8882 : When one points at another, he instinctively goes for the chest.
8883 : Or perhaps, if they were doing so as a sign of anger or resentment, would aim for the face instead.
8884 : So let me ask you to think carefully--where was Ygnas pointing?
8885 : Where was Ygnas pointing? At her chest! At her waist! Toward the sky!
8886 : Are you quite certain? Reflect, %, and tell me if that is truly the right answer.
8887 : Always had a penchant for humor, this one.
8888 : Aha. And what, pray tell, is it about her waist that warrants pointing out?
8889 : What was there? A sword? Her hip bone?
8890 : Really, %? I suppose you are not strictly wrong, but...
8891 : Precisely. Arciela was not the subject of his gaze. Rather...
8892 : What truly caught his eye was...
8893 : ...the sword she had at her side. Don't you agree?
8894 : Now the question you must ask yourself is What does this all mean?
8895 : You are a smart [man/woman], %. Surely you do not need me to spoon-feed you.
8896 : His message was intended for you, was it not?
8897 : I suppose I have a few years on you, but it would be too much for you to expect me to provide all the answers.
8898 : I am not an oracle, blessed with the ability to see the truths hidden behind shadows.
8899 : The best I can do is provide you with tiny insights into the realm of possibilities.
8900 : Now if I were you...
8901 : ...I would start by finding out all I could about Arciela's blade.
8902 : And if you had to find information somewhere, where would that be?
8903 : I leave this mystery in your capable hands, %!

8913 : Oh ho, it's % again! To what do I owe the honor this time?
8914 : What would you like to ask about? Ortharsyne. The bearded guy in black. How to win at Boom or Bust.
8915 : I've heard of him in rumor, to be sure, but can't admit to ever having laid eyes on him m'self.
8916 : Haha, if I knew a surefire way to win, I sure as heck wouldn't be standing around here all day!
8917 : Ahhh, you mean that mysterious blade of hers she always keeps buckled at her waist?
8918 : Ortharsyne, you called it? It must be something special to have such an enigmatic moniker. Wish I could help you, but my specialty lies in pioneering and colonization. 'Fraid I won't be of much use.
8919 : Now if you wanted to know where you could find out more, then...hmm...
8920 : Well, well, look who the cat drrragged in. If it isn't %, here in the flesh. What a coincidence.
8921 : Let me give you a piece of advice, not as a maester but as a person. Don't rrrely on whispers and rumors for information. Look, read, feel, and find things out on your own.
8922 : And when it comes to rrreading, well...there's one place in Adoulin that stands above all.
8923 : Where else? The Celennia Memorial Librrrary!
8924 : Stop wasting your time floundering around my good-for-nothing suborrrdinates and paw your way over there! Volumes of knowledge speak more truths than this moron could ever muster.
8925 : And since I'm alrrready berating you, Levil, stop sticking your nose where it doesn't belong!
8926 : Yeah, yeah.
8927 : You think I'm making some kind of joke!?
8928 : We'll see how much enerrrgy you have left to mock me after I double your shift and take away your lunch break!
8929 : B-but my boiled tomatoes will spoil...!
8930 : Mmm hmm...so today we've learned that someone cherrrishes his meals more than his job.
8931 : N-no, it's not like that at all! Standing here and providing guidance helps my day shine brighter than the statue of Altana!
8932 : Then let me bring a little more light in your life by having you come in this Lightsday!
8933 : Goddess save me!
8934 : %, what are you still doing here? Didn't I tell you to get that scrrrawny frame of yours over to the library? Hut-tut!
8935 : If you don't get outta here right now...well, let's just say my claws are due for a good sharrrpening.
8936 : My weekend... My lunch...
8937 : Things are just getting worse and worse. %, leave me to drown in my sorrows and head over to Celennia Memorial Library...
8938 : Have you heard? Some beasts from the jungles ran off with Arciela! The whole castle's as flustered as a flock of heartwings in heat.
8939 : You...knew that already? And you want me to keep mum?
8940 : Now that you mention it, I think I was told to keep my mouth shut by...oh great Goddess, my wagging tongue's done it again! My back can't tolerate any more lashes!
8941 : You've got questions? Yeah, you and everyone else.
8942 : Ah, 'bout the princess's younger days? Suppose there's no harm there...
8943 : After all, who better to ask than me? I was there when they found her lying in the meadow.
8944 : Was she really protected by the animals of the forest? Well...
8945 : 'Tis all true, although they weren't animals. Oh no, animals is far too generous of a word to describe those...things.
8946 : They were vicious monsters, through and through. Yet for some reason they were encircled around Arciela, protectin' her 'sif she was one of their own.
8947 : My legs were quiverin' so hard you'd've thought I was a black pudding during an earthquake!
8948 : Howdy, pardner. Hope it hasn't been too rough out on the range. So, what can I do ya for?
8949 : What can he do for you? Give me information on Arciela. Talk about the golden tiger.
8950 : The p-princess? I'm dadgum honored to hear that you think I know anythin' about her, but I'm just a simple bisonhand.
8951 : A golden tiger, you say? By golly, I'd be spurrin' my mount harder than a twitherym dust storm to get to wherever one o' those was!
8952 : Bigger'n a boulder and fangs like logs, t'boot? Yeesh, maybe I'd be better off sweepin' the stables.
8953 : Either way, I ain't got nothin' on a beastie fittin' that description. Maybe the Scouts' Coalition does, though.
8954 : Hmmm...a tiger more golden than the shiniest belt buckle on the islands? Maybe the Scouts' Coalition knows. They lasso all sorts o' intelligence of a woodsy nature.
8955 : Boy, you've sure come upon me at the wrong time, %.
8956 : Ingrid the high-and-mighty spirit-spooker and her cloister of lackeys have got me fuming more than a basalt fields geyser!
8957 : I took enough verbal lashings from them about reporting even the most trivial details, then they traipse off into the jungle without so much as a peep!
8958 : Have anything to say? Do you know where they went? They didn't tell you a single thing?
8959 : Were you listening to me in the least?
8960 : I said I know as much about this as the waves. The only speculation I heard was from the castle guard. She told me the exorcists were flapping their lips about Kamihr Drifts.
8961 : Goddess be good, the only way to get there is through a series of labyrinthine tunnels that would put a wiggling snake to shame.
8962 : If they get in trouble down there, we'll need to send a search party for the search party!
8963 : I just hope it doesn't come to something like that... Having the search party get lost underground would be a tragedy.
8964 : Hmmm, hm...hmmmmmm hmmm hm hmmmmmm...
8965 : Huh? So what if I'm minding my own business playing the nose harp? You wanna fight about it?
8966 : Want to fight about it? Ready and rarin'. ...
8967 : Hmpf, forget about it. I'm not gonna let myself end up as just another bush whacked in your pioneering conquest.
8968 : ...Ugh, I can't take this! Whoever said silence is golden was never on the receiving end of the silent treatment!
8969 : You really wanna know why I'm so happy? Let's just say even someone like me who shovels Lhe's bureaucratic manure all day has occasion to get excited.
8970 : You know how everyone was worried about Arciela's sudden disappearance, right?
8971 : Then maybe you'd know whether this whopper's actually got some weight behind it or not.
8972 : They say Arciela was spirited away by a demonic varmint. Well, what do you think? Could it actually be true?
8973 : How do you respond? Distract him by humming. Try to laugh dismissively. Say you have no idea.
8974 : %...I never thought I'd say this, but your humming's the most terrifying thing I've ever heard. It sounds like the wailing of the damned! Wait, what were we talking about?
8975 : Yikes, is that what you call a laugh? It sounds like a raptor mating call! I had to brace myself for a second. Wait, what were we talking about?
8976 : Oh. Hmmm... If you don't know, I can't imagine anyone else has the foggiest.
8977 : Well, the important thing is that the princess is as snug as a bug in a rug once again.
8978 : Speaking of which...
8979 : She's been moseying on into our humble establishment quite often ever since she returned.
8980 : With Ygnas's illness eating away at his capability to lead, seeing her sweet face has been a breath of fresh air to the pioneering initiative.
8981 : Colonization has been marching along to the tune of progress, and we Pioneers' Coalition members get to gaze upon Arciela's radiant beauty almost every day. It's enough to move you to song!
8982 : Oh, come on. I thought you could take a joke. Either way, that's not all her return has blessed us with.
8983 : I'm not sure why, but even those curmudgeons in the Order of Weatherspoon have stopped flapping their gums over the colonization issue. I can finally work without getting a sermon about the founder king's last words.
8984 : Come to think of it, I bumped into Ingrid from that very order the other day.
8985 : She gave me the dirtiest look I've ever seen in my life when I mentioned your name. You'd have thought I'd spat in the face of the Goddess or something.
8986 : What in the high seas happened between you two? Wait, maybe it's best not to pry.
8987 : I will say, though, scuttlebutt has it that the exorcists no longer make patrols into the jungle.
8988 : Could it be that...you called upon some unholy powers to manipulate them into--
8989 : Levil! Less shirrrking, more working!
8990 : L-Leathery Lhe...
8991 : You can be sure I'll tan your hide if you call me that again, rrrunt!
8992 : Whoopsie, did I say that out loud? I guess I'll have to tell the others we can't use it anymore.
8993 : What was that!?
8994 : Uhhh...look at the time! So much to do, and such a tight schedule. I best put my nose back to the grindstone!
8995 : Hmph... Levil, I never knew you were so devoted to purrrforming well.
8996 : What? Oh, um...I mean you can't judge a book by its cover, Maester Lhangavo!
8997 : If that's the case, then why don't you take a page out of my book and kiss your next day off goodbye?
8998 : Whaaat!? Nooooooooo!
8999 : (I never know if he's playing cat and mouse with me or if he's rrreally that dumb.)
9000 : As it would happen, %, I have a rrrequest.
9001 : You see, we've just learned that a prrroblem has arisen within the Couriers' Coalition.
9002 : Even though it may turn out to pose only the tiniest of thrrreats to colonization, we must walk like a cat on eggs.
9003 : Now that the voice of opposition has finally gone silent, we can't afford to jeopardize the strrrides we've made.
9004 : Failure is not an option here.
9005 : That's why I need you to go to the Couriers' Coalition and find the source of this trrrouble. Will you do that for me?
9006 : Will you do it? No problem. Not right now.
9007 : Thank you.
9008 : Hopefully you can trrrack down and snap this problem's neck in two before it causes us any harm. Happy hunting, %!
9009 : Hm? You have more prrressing business elsewhere?
9010 : Despite the fact you've been prrrattling on with Levil about nothing in particular? I see...
9011 : (I won't resent you for it. In fact, I highly suggest doing what she says before she fills your pioneering life with fire and brrrimstone.)
9012 : Our slave driver--er, maester--wants me to ask you to investigate the issue with the Couriers' Coalition.
9013 : News of how the princess survived being captive by a fur-lined anathema has sprrread throughout the city.
9014 : The people have rallied around it, helping close the rrrift between the Twelve Orders...for the time being.
9015 : I would've preferred a less drrramatic solution, but I'll take what I can get in this day and age.
9016 : Damn me to the darkness...
9017 : Whoa! It's been such a long time since I last saw you, %.
9018 : What's the matter? We've no place to store this massive cargo destined for the Middle Lands, that's what.
9019 : None of the documents are even in order. It's partly the finance minister's fault, but still...
9020 : You do know that the minister has to sign off on all national transactions, right?
9021 : Of course, that doesn't apply to private business deals, so you'd think the work would be manageable enough.
9022 : However, every form has been littered with mistakes lately. It's plunged the warehouse into utter chaos, I tell you!
9023 : Now that I mention it, I don't recall a time when Adoulin's finances were in such a state.
9024 : The Order of Woltaris trains their members well. Every minister I've heard of has studied there, and they've all been absolute sorcerers with numbers.
9025 : Perhaps the greatest of them all is our current one, Melvien de Malecroix. He can tally hundreds of different accounts in the blink of an eye, all while eating a three-course breakfast!
9026 : He needs but a brief glance over even a tower of documents to spot every single error, and only a few swift strokes of the quill to rectify them.
9027 : That's what makes this rash of obvious mistakes even more odd. We've seen not just mathematical errors, but whole chunks of information omitted.
9028 : Thanks to the ministry's sloppy work, our warehouse is overflowing with some materials and completely lacking others. It's physically impossible to fulfill all our orders with what we have!
9029 : Sorry to drag you into this, %, but could you possibly head to the waterfront and check on how things are going?
9030 : I'm sure it's all topsy-turvy over there, but maybe you can find which end is up.
9031 : <Sigh> When will this drudgery cease!?
9032 : What in the...? What would a pioneer like you be doing at this cesspool of a warehouse?
9033 : How is it going? Do you even need to ask? Take a look around--it is bedlam incarnate!
9034 : We have a dearth of bare necessities and a surplus of luxury items. I cannot fathom how our city will be able to subsist if this ridiculousness continues any further!
9035 : Guilberien, may I have a word with you?
9036 : If you think I have the time for idle twaddle, you are sorely--
9037 : My apologies, Lord Estienneux.
9038 : You have no time for kissing up to people, Guilberien.
9039 : I am here to inform you that we still do not have an adequate time frame for shipping you-know-what.
9040 : You surely do not mean...
9041 : Ugh, this is enough to make me bash my head against the warehouse wall.
9042 : Do you see what I mean, pioneer!? It is a veritable maelstrom here!
9043 : Oh my... You would not happen to be % by any chance, would you?
9044 : Have I heard of you? Of course I have!
9045 : I would venture that there is nary a person in Castle Adoulin who has not heard your name. It echoes from the rafters wherever patrons and servants alike gather.
9046 : What? This mealymouthed [guy/girl] is really that famous?
9047 : Indeed [he/she] is. I assume that is thanks, in large part, to how much trust Arciela places in [him/her].
9048 : That hardly comes as a surprise, though, if the tales of %'s adventures in the Middle Lands are to be believed.
9049 : While we are on the topic of introductions, allow me to make my own.
9050 : My name is Estienneux, and I am an aide of Melvien de Malecroix.
9051 : Sir Melvien has been preoccupied of late with other tasks, so I have assumed his ministerial duties for the time being.
9052 : And a right mess of it you have made, too.
9053 : Would I could argue with that statement... Yes, I admit that my capabilities pale in comparison to the minister's.
9054 : In my defense, though, no being could review dozens of documents simultaneously as he does. It is not hyperbolic in the least to suggest that Melvien de Malecroix is the single biggest reason for the nation's mercantile success.
9055 : I have barely slept a wink in the past fortnight, yet have come nowhere near to replicating his efficie... Huh?
9056 : W-was that...a landshiver?
9057 : It...it would stand to reason, seeing how there has been a spate of them recently.
9058 : For certain. They are equally as disheartening as the current distribution situation, if not more so.
9059 : The last one of some force decimated a church on a nearby islet. To think, a building of historic significance that stood for generations, gone in an instant.
9060 : Where would we ever find the bayld with which to rebuild it? Although I suppose that is the least of our worries at this juncture.
9061 : ...Which brings me to something I would like to discuss with you, %.
9062 : To tell the truth, we have been saddled with a tall order from your homeland.
9063 : They request a contrivance that is oft made by our very own Inventors' Coalition.
9064 : To craft it, we would need %, %, %, %, and %.
9065 : Nothing else comes to mind, at least.
9066 : As you may have already surmised, the commodity in question is a bison jacket. Made from the finest of Ulbukan materials, it proved so popular that it found its way to the Middle Lands generations prior.
9067 : The coalition artisans that stitch them are so finely skilled that not even the most scrupulous of fashionistas can tell the difference between those jackets and the originals.
9068 : Therefore, it is only natural that we are inundated with orders from the Middle Lands. While we have measures in place to fulfill this hearty demand, we simply are not prepared for an order of these proportions. Oh, and by the way...
9069 : Yes, I now realize that I forgot to add one of those items I mentioned to the official list of required materials we sent earlier. Please forgive me that oversight.
9070 : Thanks to my folly, we are now short on %.
9071 : Our client is breathing down my neck about a shipment, so I will likely need to ask other pioneers to lend me their aid as well.
9072 : %, I beseech you. Could you please find it in your heart of hearts to help rectify my mistake?
9073 : Help out? The pleasure is all mine. Help yourself, windbag.
9074 : Your largess truly knows no bounds!
9075 : Once you procure # ), I would ask that you bring it to Guilberien at the warehouse for safekeeping. May the heavens light your way!
9076 : Why must all in the administration be seen as peddlers of falsehoods and sophistry? If only there were some brave soul to help us regain the confidence of the people and coalitions... <Wink>
9077 : What sort of land lies beyond our western horizon? Perhaps you pioneers will, in time, be the ones to solve that riddle through the colonization effort.
9078 : If so, you might even bear witness to the elusive natives and their original bison jackets.
9079 : By all appearances, this building functions as a warehouse for the Couriers' Coalition.
9080 : You are tasked with procuring # ).
9081 : Your help is much appreciated, %. With this in our hands, we can finally ship out!
9082 : One last thing. Could you inform the Couriers' Coalition that we will soon be able to provide them with their portion as well? Thank you so much.
9083 : Speak of the demon. If it isn't %. We just received our allotment of the goods you helped procure.
9084 : I'm sure you've already been thanked, but allow me to do so too. Judging from what I gathered, the waterfront must have been in pandemonium.
9085 : So this fiasco was all due to the finance ministry's miscalculations? That's rather odd...
9086 : Melvien de Malecroix's mind is sharper than a spear, and his passion for the colonization movement burns brighter than a wildfire.
9087 : Someone as intelligent as he must see that any negative impact on trade with the Middle Lands will adversely affect pioneering.
9088 : I guess the rumors were true after all...
9089 : Anything to say? You mean... What rumors?
9090 : I can't attest to the veracity of these claims, but I heard that the majority of the finance minister's duties are now being handled by aides.
9091 : However, even this legion of assistants can't seem to match his bookkeeping prowess.
9092 : How he's been able to stay afloat in that veritable sea of paperwork is beyond me, but it reaffirms just how extraordinary an individual he is.
9093 : Anyway, my point is that myriad hardships have befallen our sacred city in his absence.
9094 : Such is the inevitable consequence of a whole organization relying on one person, I suppose. As they say, A bridge with one abutment can't help but collapse.
9095 : ...Or at least that's what my mentor always said.
9096 : In retrospect, perhaps I shouldn't be making light of the situation when the nation's fate is at stake. Wouldn't be prudent.
9097 : What would be prudent, though, is apprising Maester Reginald of this possible development.
9098 : They may still be just rumors, but our little talk just now has given me pause. One can never be too cautious with such sensitive information.
9099 : Thanks for helping me make up my mind, %! Oh, and for helping down at the waterfront, too.
9100 : Will you give my thanks to Levil as well? You can find him in the Pioneers' Coalition, now that Maester Lhangavo revoked his day off.
9101 : Ahhh, %. What exactly was brrrewing at the Couriers' Coalition?
9102 : I see. So the finance ministrrry has nincompoops as big as ours, huh?
9103 : You might not feel like you've done much, but trading is all about trrrust, and you've definitely earned the Couriers' Coalition's.
9104 : What's that? % saved the day once again!?
9105 : I knew from the very first moment I laid eyes on you that you were destined to become a walking legend!
9106 : And the more I listen to your caterwauling, the more I'm convinced you've never been anything but a walking trrravesty.
9107 : Th-th-that's not true! Right, %? Right!?
9108 : How do you respond? He's passionate about his job. Levil's great...at flapping his lips.
9109 : Aw, say it ain't so! My only ally is now my enemy!
9110 : ...Is that so?
9111 : Well, he's definitely a different breed of cat...one that won't even scrrratch when I tell him I'm going to double his assignments.
9112 : (I always find that Levil's work imprrroves when he has a fire under his tail, heh heh heh.)
9113 : As always, I apprrreciate what you've done for us, %.
9114 : This may not be much, but you more than deserrrve it.
9115 : I wonder what Melvien is prrreoccupying himself with, though.
9116 : I don't know of anyone who needs his expurrrtise right now...
9117 : Damn minister of finance, making my life a living apocalypse!
9118 : ...Oooh, feels kind of nice to blame someone besides Lhe once in a while. Anyway, I'm sure we'll need your help soon enough, so don't stray too far.
9119 : Ah, %, just the pioneer I wanted to see!
9120 : The princess is here to see you.
9121 : I had a hunch that I could find you here, %.
9122 : You do remember what transpired in Kamihr Drifts, don't you?
9123 : Do you remember? Like yesterday. That's ancient history.
9124 : I like to think I can appreciate a good jape as much as the next lady, but now is not the time.
9125 : Then I assume you'll be interested in hearing exactly where the light that spewed forth from Ortharsyne was directing us.
9126 : After we parted ways, I took the liberty of unsheathing the blade in one more spot.
9127 : That way, it would create another line for reference.
9128 : And since the two separate paths had to intersect eventually, I used that to approximate the location.
9129 : Just to be sure, I compared my proposed site with ancient records like the founder king's travelogue.
9130 : While none of my sources were too exact, I think it's safe to say we must head for...the summit of Mount Kamihr.
9131 : One of the entries mentioned King August's visit to the mountain, which is probably as much proof as we're going to get.
9132 : My guess is we'll find that serpent of the sky roosting there, shimmering scales and all. At least that's what the words of my father's poem say to me.
9133 : In an eage whence schade dennen his land, the ore of the swallow's witeword shalt be fulfilled.
9134 : The warants of forest shalt raise the merke blade high, and one of the whyte fether shalt florischen the swerdes sext.
9135 : If we are to believe in them, then the dragon that resides there is probably the key to quelling the strange plague afflicting our continent.
9136 : For these reasons and more, %, would you mind accompanying me to the top of Mount Kamihr?
9137 : Accompany her? Yes, of course. No, my ore collection calls.
9138 : Thank you so much!
9139 : Come to think of it, I've never actually met a dragon face-to-face...err...snout. I can't help but feel afraid at just the thought of it.
9140 : At least you'll be by my side, %. As an adventurer, you've probably bested whole broods of them.
9141 : If that's the case, then I have nothing to fear at all! How lucky I am to have met you.
9142 : Enough twittering like a schoolgirl, though. This is no trivial matter. When you've properly steeled yourself for the journey, come meet me at Jorius Yett.
9143 : Hm? No, I never once thought about stopping Arciela.
9144 : Why? Because, despite her claims of being scared, I'm confident that she's as tough as any dragon. Besides, she's ventured deep into the jungle countless times already, no?
9145 : Don't go spreading this around, but I might have some juicy tidbits for you to chew on.
9146 : You know how you said you had no idea whether or not Arciela was carried off by some beast? Well, I might have overheard the answer.
9147 : Word has it that she was indeed dragged away in the bloodstained maw of some otherworldly abomination while resting outside the city gates! Does that get your knees a-knockin' or what?
9148 : You can be sure that Arciela had the worst of it, but even the Order of Weatherspoon-led search party traveled a rocky road straight off the cliff of humiliation.
9149 : They not only failed to find any clues as to her whereabouts by themselves, but were ambushed by hordes of creatures, the likes of which were heretofore undocumented. Some members even returned with grave wounds...supposedly inflicted by a tiger of monumental stature.
9150 : Luckily, some capable pioneers stumbled upon them and were able to use their superior tracking skills to lead the exorcists to our princess. A close call, for certain.
9151 : And what of Arciela, I hear you thinking.
9152 : The powers that be within the Twelve Orders forcefully persuaded the Order of Adoulin to forbid her from entering the jungle, on account of the dangers present there.
9153 : I understand their cause for concern, seeing as how Arciela's to be the next in line to lead the nation, should her brother's health continue to fail.
9154 : Anything to say? Long live Ygnas! What happened after that?
9155 : ...You sure your brain isn't in an otherworldly skirmish right now?
9156 : What do you think happened?
9157 : She's not one to just lie there after falling off her horse. She got back up and registered herself as a pioneer, that's what!
9158 : I believe her exact words were, Our sovereign nation is no monarchy, nor is anyone from our order guaranteed a position of leadership. As long as my brother remains the chancellor, I am just another citizen of this fine city.
9159 : Furthermore, as any citizen may apply to become a pioneer, I choose to exercise that right. I assume none of you take issue with the legislation you first enacted, do you?
9160 : I just about spit the frontier soda I was drinking all over Lhe when I heard about it! To think that Arciela already wants to head back into the jungle despite almost being devoured.
9161 : ...Or is it exactly because of that experience that she decided to get official permission this time?
9162 : Although, I guess the maesters and ministers would rather have her traipsing about the forest under the auspices of the Pioneers' Coalition than sneaking off in the dead of night.
9163 : None of this really answers the question of what that monster wanted from her, but maybe this is a perfect case of all's well that ends well.
9164 : Anyway, the bottom line is that no one can stop Arciela now.
9165 : It's not like she'll be completely on her own, either. Her order will be informed each and every time she passes through Jorius Yett, and they're bound to employ a bodyguard for her when you're off slicing your way through the jungle.
9166 : Now when you escort the princess, you'll not only have her opinion of you on your mind, but the eyes of every member of every Adoulinian order on your back!
9167 : Does that get your blood pumping or what? Hahaha.
9168 : In all seriousness, though, I believe in you. The fate of our princess is in your hands, %!
9169 : I've never seen a more determined face than yours is right now, %. Good to know you're ready.
9170 : Well then, shall we get going for Mount Kamihr?
9171 : Ah, yes, that certainly is...a task.
9172 : Well, if you finish with that and would condescend to help uncover a continent's history, then I'll be waiting for you.
9173 : (Come on, %, even I wouldn't use that poor of an excuse.)
9174 : (Regardless, how can you refuse her polite request when you see how serious she is? Just look at those eyes!)
9175 : Why're you here all by your lonesome and not out escorting the princess!? Didn't my talk scare you straight at all?
9176 : An untainted section of the forest, hmm? You mean like a new ergon locus?
9177 : Hmm...this might be a bit of a long shot, but... One of your pioneer buddies came by the other day, saying that he saw a wooded area deep within Kamihr Drifts.
9178 : I've never been out there myself, but it doesn't make any sense. There's no business for a forest to be in that desolate wasteland.
9179 : On the other hand, Ulbuka is a land of mysteries. Who can really tell? Yorcia and Hennetiel are forests, and the soil there reeks of poison.
9180 : On the third hand, frostbite does strange things to a man's faculties.
9181 : Sorry, %. I probably left you more confused than when you came in.
9182 : Cut #.
9183 : Cut #.
9184 : Start the cutscene.

9189 : [//////]
9190 : Huh? You got somethin' to ask me?
9191 : What's this now? You're lookin' fer info about them leafkin? Cute little buggers, boy howdy!
9192 : Every time they send me off to some frontier station or other I take a quick look fer 'em, but they're too clever to get caught.
9193 : I got a monster of a tale for you, though! One time I done seen one down in Foret de Hennetiel. He was fiddling around wit' somethin' or other down by the Zoldeff River. I almost went down to check it out fer myself...but, you know, tight schedules 'n all.
9194 : Stupid coalitions and the damn work they give me. I'd rather go fishing down there and see if I can catch another glimpse of 'em.
9195 : 'Member what I told you--down in Foret de Hennetiel was the place I saw 'em.
9196 : Not another person coming to ask me about leafkin!
9197 : Don't tell me you think they're adorable, too? Dumb creatures only get in my way.
9198 : Get this--I was in the Yahse Hunting Grounds, just minding my own business, see? And one of the stupid beasties hurls a rock at me!
9199 : Where, you ask? Hmm... Let me take a look at my map... Yeah, somewhere around J-6.
9200 : Hey, if you want to chase 'em down, that's your call. Just don't come crying back to me if you end up with a couple lumps on your head.
9201 : If you really want to see a leafkin, try heading to the Yahse Hunting Grounds, near coordinates J-6. Just make sure to wear something hard on your head, ok?
9202 : First my back, now my shoulders... Sometimes I wonder if I'm really cut out for this sort of work.
9203 : Gotta catch me a look at one of those cute little creatures again someday.
9204 : A word of advice: if you're interested in pioneering, you need to keep your body in tip-top shape.
9205 : I mean, really. All wet behind the ears. No way you'll move up around here for years to come!
9206 : On behalf of the Mummers' Coalition, I welcome you to Adoulin.
9207 : Unlike the other coalitions, our support of you pioneers is rather indirect. We provide all manner of recreational and relaxation services to help you get back into the field well-rested and ready for action.
9208 : One of our more popular events is the raptor fights that occur periodically in the Watergarden Coliseum, located in Rala Waterways.
9209 : Well, as long as you're here, you might as well let me give you a brief description of them.
9210 : I'll bet you're just itching to catch a glimpse of the excitement, aren't you?
9211 : Well, you'll be able to scratch that itch soon enough, for another bout is scheduled in the not-too-distant future. Just don't scream yourself hoarse rooting for one that catches your eye.
9212 : There won't be any need to worry about that. The raptor tournament is going to be canceled.
9213 : But--aren't you from the Peacekeepers' Coalition? On what grounds would you shut it down?
9214 : One of your raptors went on a bit of a rampage. Call down Maester Flaviria immediately.
9215 : A rampage? What sort of lunacy is this!?
9216 : Wesley! There you are. Where on Vana'diel were you wandering around this whole time?
9217 : Maester Flaviria...
9218 : Impeccable timing, as always. There is a matter I wish to discuss.
9219 : Oh? What could the Peacekeepers' Coalition want with me?
9220 : And at such a busy time! We're all running around like chocobos with our heads cut off preparing for the upcoming fights.
9221 : Maester, he says that one of our raptors has caused a bit of an incident.
9222 : Incident? What's this now?
9223 : One of your raptors broke out of its stable and put some civilians in extreme danger.
9224 : We managed to find it before it caused any real damage, but if we had been even a moment later...
9225 : I find such brazen accusations rather hard to swallow, with Wesley there watching him the whole time.
9226 : I turned my head away just for an instant, and before I knew it...
9227 : Preposterous.
9228 : In my opinion, the system for monitoring those creatures is wholly insufficient. It's only a matter of time before another one escapes...and next time we may not be so lucky. The Peacekeepers' Coalition sees no easy way to resolve this issue.
9229 : Accordingly, we would like to ask for your cooperation in discussing this matter. Please accompany me back to our headquarters so that my superiors may consult with you directly.
9230 : Fine. As for the two of you--just keep this between us. I don't want things to exacerbate an already tense situation.
9231 : I can't believe it.
9232 : It is all my responsibility. If I had been more careful...
9233 : Wesley, which one broke out?
9234 : It...
9235 : ...It was Vorahal.
9236 : What!?
9237 : Vorahal may be the fiercest gladiator ever to grace our raptor fights, but never once have I heard of him harming a soul outside the ring!
9238 : But we have no reason to doubt that the Peacekeeper representative was telling us the truth.
9239 : They also say the victim was a man in the residential district named Ilney.
9240 : Then I'll go and ask him to tell his story!
9241 : B-but...the Maester just told us to keep quiet and mind our own business!
9242 : We've gotta do something!
9243 : E-excuse me, [sir/madam]?
9244 : Forgive me for going above my station, but...
9245 : ...But something doesn't sit right. There's no way that Vorahal would assault an innocent person.
9246 : You see, Vorahal once saved her in her moment of need, when she was under attack by the creatures of the forest.
9247 : That's what brought Vorahal to the Mummers' Coalition. I just KNOW there has to be some misunderstanding.
9248 : Please, I beg of you--go to Ilney, and listen to his story.
9249 : Thank you so much! I probably should have asked this first, but what is your name?
9250 : Thank you again, %! I'll be waiting here for your report!
9251 : I'll be here waiting for news from Ilney!
9252 : Headed to the residential area? Then you'll wanna take that road over there.
9253 : Who's there?
9254 : What's this? You want to hear how that fiendish raptor tried to tear me limb from limb?
9255 : I'm still in such shock that I can barely form a coherent thought, but if you insist...
9256 : Haven't seen you around these parts. You one of those adventurers?
9257 : Suppose that's not important. You came to hear about the tragedy that has befallen me?
9258 : I'll get straight to the point. Fresh wounds and all.
9259 : It was an ordinary morning and I was heading off to market as usual.
9260 : On my way home, I saw it right when I entered the residential district.
9261 : Well, I was downright shocked! Who wouldn't be? I tried to run, but my legs turned to jelly once it bared its cleaver-sized fangs at me!
9262 : Before I could call out for help, it jumped at me, and...well, you can see for yourself what state I'm in.
9263 : Come on. How dense would you have to be to think that training monsters to fight for entertainment was a good idea?
9264 : The Mummers' Coalition? What a bunch of fools.
9265 : They say they want people to have fun, but that don't give 'em free reign to do whatever they want!
9266 : Arrrrgh, my back! It's like a dagger cuttin' down my spine!
9267 : Gotta lie down for a bit. Is that all you needed to know? Then you can show yourself out.
9268 : Pardon me. Are you a friend of Ilney's?
9269 : I was a little concerned, because I haven't seen him about recently.
9270 : You say that he ran into a bit of trouble with one of the Mummers' Coalition's raptors?
9271 : That would explain it. I love going to watch those fights--a bit scary, but oh-so-thrilling!
9272 : I had figured he took ill. He had been walking around town with a bunch of rockberries, after all.
9273 : Any questions? What's a rockberry? Nothing in particular.
9274 : Pretty much what their name implies--berries as hard as rock. Doesn't matter how healthy your teeth or how strong your jaw, they aren't fit for people to consume.
9275 : With all those rockberries, he must have gotten an upset stomach...at least, that's what I assumed.
9276 : Well, forgive my intrusion. I'll let you get back to your business.
9277 : You went to Ilney's house for me? I knew I could trust you!
9278 : How was he?
9279 : I see...if his wounds are that severe, then I guess it was Vorahal after all...
9280 : Rockberries!? One of his neighbors said he was carrying rockberries with him?
9281 : Raptors just love rockberries. We keep a supply in the stable for them.
9282 : They aren't particularly healthy for the raptors though, so we save them as treats...much like you and I would eat cake. Mmm...cake.
9283 : But what would Ilney want with rockberries?
9284 : Is Wesley there?
9285 : And what brings you back here?
9286 : The Peacekeepers' Coalition held a meeting to come up with a solution to this most difficult problem.
9287 : You are to turn over every last raptor to us.
9288 : What kind of solution is that?
9289 : I'm sure I don't have to spell it out.
9290 : Th-there's no way our Maester would permit such an extreme measure!
9291 : Maester Flaviria has given her consent. She's currently with the raptor in question.
9292 : No way!
9293 : Wesley, take me to the stables.
9294 : I beg you to reconsider!
9295 : Everything is a result of my own personal error. I promise to take full responsibility. Just, please, leave them alone!
9296 : Nothing will change with mere admissions of guilt.
9297 : ...I suppose there's nothing else we can do.
9298 : Pagnelle!
9299 : I will hand the raptors over to you.
9300 : Before you take them, though, I would like to feed them some rockberries as a last meal. Will you indulge me?
9301 : ...Fine.
9302 : Wesley. Go.
9303 : O-of course.
9304 : Have you brought the rockberries?
9305 : Well, uh...I...I don't have any rockberries. Not a one.
9306 : But you just had some the other day!
9307 : I did, but now no matter where I look, I cannot find them.
9308 : You can't even keep track of your beasts' food? <sigh> No wonder he was out for blood.
9309 : Wait! I'll go get some rockberries right now! Please, don't take the raptors until then!
9310 : You make it sound like you can buy them from some little old lady's vegetable stand!
9311 : But pioneers do tell tales of finding rockberries in the nearby woods.
9312 : You can't possibly think that you can make it there on your own.
9313 : I guess not...
9314 : <Huff> Well, you're still a young one who wants to say your goodbyes. I remember when I lost my own pet at a tender young age. I suppose there's no hurry to termin--err, provide a solution to this problem.
9315 : I'll be back.
9316 : Please, %, I have one more favor to ask of you.
9317 : I know in my heart of hearts that those poor creatures have done nothing wrong, and yet the Peacekeepers' Coalition wants to take them away. It's not just wrong, it's cruel!
9318 : But if this is how it has to be, then I want to at least give them rockberries to send them off. That way, there'll be some joy in our parting.
9319 : Will you help me by going to gather some? They grow in the forests outside of Adoulin proper.
9320 : I realize time is of the essence, but I'd like to give one to each of our raptors, so a total of...# should be sufficient.
9321 : I know full well this is a task I should be doing myself, but Eastern Ulbuka is quite hazardous, and I am unable to fend for myself.
9322 : I beg of you, find some rockberries for the poor raptors!
9323 : You've brought me some rockberries! It's a miracle!
9324 : Quick, to the stables!
9325 : Oh, thank you, kind [sir/madam]. I've been waiting for your return.
9326 : If you would, help me feed them the rockberries.
9327 : The raptor joyously munches on the rockberry.
9328 : Well, that's odd.
9329 : What is?
9330 : Tirrod isn't taking so much as a nibble. Do you suppose he's full?
9331 : Hmm...
9332 : Wait--it looks like there's something on the side of his mouth.
9333 : A...a rockberry?
9334 : Could it be that Tirrod ate all the rockberries?
9335 : You mean...Tirrod broke out of his pen, too?
9336 : But then wouldn't the shelves be knocked over and everything in disarray?
9337 : You have a point. Then how...?
9338 : What? Ilney?
9339 : Oh, that's right--Ilney had some rockberries on him!
9340 : You think Ilney broke into the stables and fed rockberries to Tirrod?
9341 : But what could he possibly hope to accomplish?
9342 : Got some rockberries, I see. Better than chomping into another citizen, at least.
9343 : Unfortunately for you, though, I'll be taking them away now.
9344 : Wesley. Come take them to the Peacekeepers' Coalition with me.
9345 : ...As you wish.
9346 : <Sniff, sniff>... <Sob>
9347 : There, there, Pagnelle. No need to bawl like a newborn.
9348 : B-but... <Sniff> Why, Maester? Why'd you agree to <sniff> let them go?
9349 : Oh, that? It's simple. I needed an excuse to go see Vorahal.
9350 : I had to see for sure if the raptor they captured was really him.
9351 : You really think Vorahal would get captured so easily, like a mouse in a trap?
9352 : An excuse to meet with them? You'd sacrifice innocent raptors just for that!?
9353 : You've been under my employ for years now, and should know that I would never permit them to leave so easily.
9354 : But, W-Wesley just took them all away!
9355 : Bwaaaaaah!!!
9356 : Tsk tsk. And I needed a reliable witness, too.
9357 : Hm? Well, this is the problem. The Peacekeepers' Coalition without a doubt got their talons on our dear Vorahal.
9358 : It is unfathomable that they could do this without aid, however.
9359 : No, they obviously had the help of someone familiar with raptors.
9360 : That's why I went to see them. We have to ensnare them in their own trap.
9361 : There it is! The raptor went that way!
9362 : Aha.
9363 : It escaped to the Rala Waterways! Come on, men, follow me!
9364 : Well, %, I suggest you head for the Waterways as well.
9365 : Why? You have done us a great service so far, and witnessing the fruits of your labor will doubtlessly provide you with a sense of vindication.
9366 : Oh, come now. Don't give me that look.
9367 : Really--if I go, the co-conspirator will never emerge from the shadows.
9368 : The Peacekeepers' Coalition has an outpost station down there. If you stay just out of sight, the fun will come right to you.
9369 : The Maester said to wait by the Peacekeepers' Coalition's station down in Rala Waterways...
9370 : ...But what does she think is going to happen?
9371 : ...Oh, sorry, %. I didn't see you there.
9372 : I still can't get over the shock that...they're gone. They're really gone.
9373 : As if losing three close friends wasn't punishment enough, their departure spells the ruination of our coalition!
9374 : Wh-what? This whole thing was just a plot fabricated by the Peacekeepers' Coalition?
9375 : Then you mean to say--
9376 : ...Stay your heart, Pagnelle!
9377 : They're all OK! Even Vorahal!
9378 : Oh, bless Altana!
9379 : Now listen, you two. We've got some work to do if the next fights are going to be a success!
9380 : Right!
9381 : I was so scared that I wouldn't be able to see the crowds roar for our raptor friends ever again.
9382 : Our lives would have been turned upside down if not for you, %!
9383 : This is merely a token of my appreciation for all you've done, but please--I want you to have it.
9384 : Remember that all fights take place in the Rala Waterways Watergarden Coliseum. I hope to see you there sometime, %.
9385 : Did you enjoy the recent fights?
9386 : Tirrod really put on a spectacular show for everyone. The way the spectators cheered and whistled really hit home for me.
9387 : Phew! Adoulin is such an expansive city. Walking around really hits the ol' bones. Take care you don't get lost, or you may find yourself out of breath, too!
9388 : What're you idiots doing just standing there!? You were supposed to head off to the Ceizak Battlegrrrounds two hours ago!
9389 : But ma'am, there's something odd going on in the forest, so we need to make better preparations so--
9390 : Preparations!? How are you going to make preparations if you haven't even surrrveyed what's out there?
9391 : What a worthless bunch you are. You say the forrrest is acting strange, but the damned thing is alive. It would be stranger if it was normal.
9392 : B-but, I've heard stories that it's haunted!
9393 : Stop mewling like kittens, the lot of you! I'll give you a beating so good that ghosts will be the least of your trrroubles!
9394 : N-no! Not that!
9395 : <Sigh>... The only people brave enough to go into that forest are pioneers. It's not a place for the likes of us.
9396 : I know. But someone like that [man/woman] over there, however...
9397 : Hey, you're right!
9398 : Hey, you! You look able-bodied. Would you mind heading over to the battlegrounds for us?
9399 : You can't be serious! If Leathery Lhe gets even a whiff that we're shirking our duties--
9400 : So then you want us to go waltzing in by ourselves? I promise, if something attacks you, I'm hightailing it outta there!
9401 : Yeah, well--wait... Some friend you turned out to be!
9402 : Hey, it is what it is.
9403 : You there. Would you mind collecting a dirt sample for us? I promise it won't be difficult work.
9404 : Lend a hand? Might as well. You couldn't pay me enough.
9405 : Hmph. I guess there are some places even pioneers dare not tread.
9406 : Eamonn, you can't just push our work onto others!
9407 : You got any better ideas?
9408 : Well, um...
9409 : See? I knew you didn't.
9410 : That's a large burden off our shoulders, let me tell you!
9411 : The place you need to investigate is pretty much in the middle of Ceizak Battlegrounds. You have my eternal thanks, pal!
9412 : Pretty much in the middle? How's [he/she] supposed to find what [he's/she's] looking for?
9413 : Let me show you on my map. See here? G-8.
9414 : Just keep it a secret from Leathery Lhe! And don't let her know I call her that!
9415 : Didn't I already tell you where you have to go? Pretty much in the middle of Ceizak Battlegrounds.
9416 : I told you, you need to be more specific.
9417 : If we don't hurry up with our survey, the maester's going to have our hides!
9418 : Well, unless you know someone who's willing to go to Ceizak Battlegrounds in our place...
9419 : Hey, how'd you like to see real live ghosts?
9420 : They were on the road to the Cirdas Caverns located within the Sih Gates.
9421 : It's not like we were frightened or anything. Just forgot something!
9422 : Standing around again, are we? That's enough of that. Quit dillydallying and scrrrub those floors now!
9423 : W-we were about to start!
9424 : You're not even sorry, are you?
9425 : Well, if you don't carrre about your job, then I guess that means you don't care about your paycheck.
9426 : Not my gil! Noooooo...!
9427 : Sorry that these two morrrons gave you so much trouble.
9428 : Hey, %. Sorry that these two morrrons gave you so much trouble.
9429 : Don't worry. I've made sure that they're the ones compensating you for your efforrrts. It's not much, but here you are.
9430 : I'll level with you. What happened in the forrrest makes my fur stand on end.
9431 : To think that Shla sacrrrificed herself to stop pioneers from progressing into the land...
9432 : But don't think for a second that I'll be rrrunning away with my tail between my legs.
9433 : I won't let whatever prrrowls those woods--no matter how dastardly or deadly--continue to exist. It threatens all of Adoulin.
9434 : I know Shla gave us her utmost warnings.
9435 : But when push came to shove, she brrroke her promise to me. In return, I feel justified in breaking one to her.
9436 : That'll make us even.
9437 : If she wants to lecture us, she can do it when we're dead. Besides, if we succeed, then our nine lives are still safe and sound, rrright?
9438 : Of course, we can't do it alone. The Pioneers' Coalition is always in need of steady hands and strrrong minds.
9439 : Do you suppose the danger she was trying to warn us of was Ra'Kaznar?
9440 : Then we definitely can't turn tail on this thrrreat.
9441 : This whole situation means we made the right call rrrecruiting adventurers from the Middle Lands.
9442 : If I knew then what I know now, I would never have tried pawning our duties off on an innocent bystander.
9443 : Half my salary...how am I supposed to live on that?
9444 : My good lady, a word, if you please.
9445 : Of course. How may I assist you?
9446 : The weather has been pleasant these past few weeks, and my % have reached full bloom. I was hoping to give some to Mistress Svenja.
9447 : How very thoughtful of you! Word of your beautiful flowers has reached us even here. Unfortunately, our mistress is currently out on an errand of some import, but I will make sure she receives them.
9448 : Svenja's not here? Damn it. I was hoping to take a break from my patrol and shoot the breeze with her. No one knows more about what's going on in the city than she.
9449 : Vastran! You duty-shirking dimwit, wasting your time with this nonsense!
9450 : The Peacekeepers are the face of the city! The captain'll have your hide if he gets wind of your shenanigans!
9451 : And what about you, Fostaig? I don't recall seeing the minister's residence on your route, either.
9452 : W-well, I was just concerned...for her well-being. If I don't worry about her, then who will?
9453 : But if she's not here...
9454 : Oh my, it is nothing so dire, I assure you. I will let her know of your concern at the earliest convenience.
9455 : <Sigh> Back to work, then!
9456 : Forgive me--I did not notice you there. Have you come to see Mistress Svenja as well?
9457 : I am afraid that she is not here at present. She had a pressing matter to deal with at the Celennia Memorial Library.
9458 : In fact, I am a bit surprised that she has not yet returned.
9459 : If your task is urgent, I suggest you visit the library and discuss it with her there.
9460 : The library is located right next to the Scouts' Coalition in Eastern Adoulin.
9461 : If you hurry, you may still be able to catch her.
9462 : Mistress Svenja's urgent business has taken her to the Celennia Memorial Library.
9463 : That face... Now I remember. You came here earlier looking for Mistress Svenja, did you not?
9464 : What an odd plant you have brought with you. What would you have me do with it?
9465 : You mean it has curative properties that will help some poor young lad make a full recovery?
9466 : These are the very words of our mistress herself? Then I shall see that she receives it right away.
9467 : Your efforts to aid our order are greatly appreciated, and most certainly deserve proper remuneration.
9468 : ...
9469 : The door is firmly shut.
9470 : Mistress Svenja is quite busy researching a new type of medicinal concoction. I'm afraid it will be a while before she is able to entertain visitors.
9471 : Why, would you look who it is! Have you brought some more % for our mistress?
9472 : Y-yes, I have. Where can I find her?
9473 : I hate to turn you away after all your generosity, but you must understand that she is quite busy these days.
9474 : Do not fret--I will make sure they reach her.
9475 : Oh...I see. Thank you very much.
9476 : Oh, I remember you. You are the [man/woman] who found some % for us, right?
9477 : I am so pleased you came to see us again. Thanks to your help, Mistress Svenja and other members of our order have begun looking for a cure for that poor lad.
9478 : It was not three days ago that we were able to give a concrete time frame for when the medicine will be ready. You should have seen the smile on his--Logan's--face.
9479 : I am a bit embarrassed to ask you such a question at this late juncture, but...I forgot to inquire as to your name.
9480 : %, thank you again for all you have done for us.
9481 : Logan mentioned that he wanted to express his gratitude directly, so I humbly ask that you do us the kindness of stopping by his residence.
9482 : He is in the local hospital at present. Just turn left and you'll find it.
9483 : Hm? Just who are you?
9484 : Ohhh...you're the one who found the % for me.
9485 : You have my thanks. I should be able to head back out to the continent once they've completed my medicine.
9486 : You see, I'm a pioneer. Before I got sick, I once whacked a morbol right upside the head with my pickaxe.
9487 : 'Course, it broke in half thanks to that brute's thick hide, so she started scurrying back to whatever hole she crawled out of before I could finish the job. <Sigh> Just my luck.
9488 : Anyway, I whipped my trusty dagger out from the side of my boot and stabbed her right as she turned around, but I must have jabbed it in there a bit too hard. Now it's gone. 'Twas my first weapon, too... What would my father say if he were alive to hear that I lost it...?
9489 : Well, on the bright side, at least I have a goal to reach for once I get out of this infirmary.
9490 : ...That reminds me. I need to tell my leader that it won't be long before I report back to duty!
9491 : If you ever find yourself in %, could you stop by the frontier station and tell Borghest that I'll be back up and on my feet in no time?
9492 : Thanks, friend!
9493 : A pioneer? What can I do for you today?
9494 : You want us to make...a pickaxe? A special request from Borghest, you say?
9495 : Aha--it must be for that young lad who is supposed to return to duty soon. So you will need it sooner rather than later, then?
9496 : Leave it to me! Or rather, one of our expert artisans. Let me just see if you've brought the materials we need... Yes, everything is in order.
9497 : We receive all manner of complex orders day in and day out, but something as simple as this will be ready in no time at all. Have a seat while we get to work.
9498 : I must confess, that was quicker than even I had anticipated. Here you are--a bona fide Inventors' Coalition original.
9499 : I will not claim that it is capable of mining every metal found in Vana'diel, but it should be more than sufficient for anything you find on the continent proper.
9500 : There is one undeniable truth about construction: that which is made can always be broken. However, I am confident in the durability of this piece.
9501 : As long as the boy makes sure to treat it with the proper care and respect, it should serve him well for many years to come.
9502 : Oh my, %! Something awful has happened! Logan has suddenly taken a turn for the worse!
9503 : Is he still conscious?
9504 : He keeps fading in and out...but even when awake, he's completely non-responsive! Isn't the medicine ready yet!?
9505 : I wish I had better news, but...the extract we made contains a substance of unknown origin.
9506 : It would be unethical to administer the treatment until we determine its exact nature and effects.
9507 : But...but...!
9508 : There's nothing any of us can do right now. Pioneer, I must ask you to leave.
9509 : A present for the patient, you say? I'll hold on to it for now.
9510 : You must give Logan the remedy, lest he suffer even further!
9511 : As I said before, we cannot do anything for him until we uncover what the strange substance contained in the mixture is.
9512 : Such a claim is hogwash! I checked the medicine myself, and it contained no traces of any materials of unknown origin.
9513 : What are you--
9514 : Othellius, think back to ten years ago...surely you can't have forgotten?
9515 : It doesn't have to be that way again. Colonization isn't forbidden anymore! We must do all that we can.
9516 : To be sure, times have changed. Perhaps more than any of us realize.
9517 : ...%, have you come to pay us a visit once more?
9518 : It is my sworn duty to tend to the ills of the populace. But this, being prevented from upholding my oath...nothing is more infuriating.
9519 : Though the bright light of colonization shines down on us once more, the darkness of the past continues to cloud the present.
9520 : What do you wish to know? What happened ten years ago? How is the medicine coming along?
9521 : Nearly ten years ago, a young man of simple upbringing was stricken with a terrible disease.
9522 : The healers of our order did their utmost to bring him back to health, but they succeeded in relieving but a portion of the symptoms.
9523 : The lad's grandfather, fraught with grief, broke the nation's most sacred of laws by venturing out into the wilds in search of an herbal remedy.
9524 : Yet never did he return to the city.
9525 : It was not long after that the grandson finally found solace in Altana's eternal embrace.
9526 : Would that the tragedy had stopped there. The sickness spread, and as medicines were hard to procure, many of Adoulin's finest suffered needlessly.
9527 : And now that we have the chance to save Logan...I cannot bear to have history repeat itself!
9528 : Othellius insists that we cannot administer the medicine until we discover what this strange substance is, but my examinations have revealed nothing out of the ordinary.
9529 : Could there be another reason for his hesitation to administer the remedy?
9530 : Hmm...maybe I should have Margret of the Scouts' Coalition see if she can find out anything.
9531 : If we know what gives him pause, perhaps we can bring him around.
9532 : I have the utmost confidence that she will lend us her aid. After all, she did so the last time Svenja entreated her.
9533 : I cannot spare any more time away from my charges, %, so may I ask you to visit Margret in my stead?
9534 : Think of it as a favor not for me, but for a man who needs you now more than ever.
9535 : %! Oh, you're a sight for sore eyes!
9536 : Was Margret's search successful? Did you find out anything about Logan's medicine?
9537 : What is your response? Tell her what you learned. Say you didn't find anything out.
9538 : N-no...there's no way Mistress Svenja would say something like that!
9539 : Alianne? What's wrong?
9540 : Mistress... Just tell me why...why won't you administer the antidote to Logan?
9541 : Has Othellius not told you? We have not properly tested it, and thus it is not safe for human use.
9542 : Is that the truth? Or are you afraid that its success might bolster colonization supporters? Is that not the real reason you are risking the life of this poor boy?
9543 : Alianne, you could not possibly think I--
9544 : Mistress Svenja, we all know of your distaste for colonization and the threat it poses to the security of our city.
9545 : But to turn your back on those who suffer for the sake of making a political statement! I just...I...I...
9546 : Alianne!
9547 : Alianne, come back!
9548 : What...what could possibly have happened to make her say such a horrible thing?
9549 : She asked you to enlist Margret's aid?
9550 : I suppose it is my fault for not giving her a thoughtful explanation.
9551 : I can only imagine the consternation this incident has caused you. Here, as recompense for your trouble.
9552 : %, I can only imagine the consternation this incident has caused you. Here, as recompense for your trouble.
9553 : In my attempts to both save the life of the ill and protect the citizens from harm, I have failed to achieve either. What's worse, both are slipping further from my grasp.
9554 : I have failed, not just as leader of the Order of Janniston, but also as a practitioner of the healing arts...
9555 : I was confident that one as talented as Margret would come up with answers, but to think that even she failed...
9556 : Logan suffers more with each passing moment. What am I to do?
9557 : Oh, %...forgive me for not thanking you properly.
9558 : Your aid in this crucial moment means the world to me--and to Logan. Here, for you.
9559 : I must convince Svenja to approve the medicine. It's the only way to save the boy's life.
9560 : Yet I am but a humble servant, so how...?
9561 : And you are...? Oh, yes, the pioneer known as %.
9562 : Here to see Alianne, correct? Unfortunately, she has been dispatched to Yorcia Weald to deal with reports of pioneers suddenly taking ill.
9563 : How fortuitous that I catch you in your manse, Svenja.
9564 : Margret? To what do I owe the honor?
9565 : I have finished deciphering the weathered tome you asked me about, and I'm afraid the situation is grave. It states that a plague nearly rent Adoulin in twain during the time of the Great Expedition.
9566 : A plague!? How could such a calamitous event be erased from our collective consciousness?
9567 : I cannot say--yet it seems that this was no ordinary malady. More than half of those infected did not live to see the next turn of the moon, and by all accounts it was the largest disaster to befall Adoulin since the city's founding.
9568 : The first victim claimed was a pioneer, and in response the king ordered the surrounding jungle burned to the ground. The exact cause was never found, but the arboreal sacrifice appeared to have its intended effect.
9569 : Some have asserted that the consumption of an unclassified species of plant was the catalyst, and that the king was persuaded by their arguments.
9570 : I cannot help but wonder if this is related to the situation with Logan.
9571 : Othellius, we cannot wait any longer. Administer the draught, now!
9572 : But Mistress Svenja, our tests are not yet--
9573 : The time for testing has passed. We must do all that we can for him.
9574 : Exercise caution with the dosage, however. We cannot be fully certain that nothing will go wrong.
9575 : O-of course.
9576 : %, this bodes ill for Alianne as well. I bid you make haste for the frontier station in Yorcia Weald.
9577 : There is not a moment to lose!
9578 : Ari-Barali! What has--?
9579 : M-Mistress Svenja...I...
9580 : Shhh. Save your energy, little one. Trust yourself to our care, and you will be up and well before the next trading vessel arrives.
9581 : Othellius, take him inside.
9582 : %? It is not like you to be so harried. Is aught amiss?
9583 : Alianne!? No, not her...
9584 : ...You're right. A city's leaders must remain strong in times of crisis.
9585 : I will dispatch my most talented herbalists to the continent's frontier stations posthaste.
9586 : As for the lad, Logan...I wish I could offer better news, but there is yet no change in his condition.
9587 : Were I a faith healer, I would be beseeching the Goddess's aid, but I can only trust that our remedy will have its intended effects.
9588 : Should these incidents be linked--and I have little doubt they are--we will require copious amounts of % just to tread water.
9589 : I fear I will be calling on you again in the weeks and months ahead. Consider this payment in advance.
9590 : Such a contagious malady casts a shadow on the future of our city. I dare not imagine what will happen should we fail to root out the cause.
9591 : Friends! Compatriots! The time has come to free our city from the shackles of the nefarious Blackthorn Coven!
9592 : They have blighted Ulbuka for too long, and now count the scaly Velkk amongst their most valued allies. None of us are safe while they roam free!
9593 : It is by our hands that evil must be banished to whence it came. To arms, brothers and sisters!
9594 : %!
9595 : I almost regurgitated my lunch--Araustoix is planning on flaying the Blackthorn Coven alive!
9596 : They promised us they were no longer in cahoots with those savage brutes, but now Vortimere has authorized an expedition to expunge them from the continent.
9597 : We've got to warn Soraa and her fellowship before they get burned to a crisp!
9598 : Let's see if we can find them at their usual haunt--near J-6 in Yorcia Weald!
9599 : If I had ten gil for how many times I've told you to keep a close eye on your suborrrdinates, Svenja, I'd be a rich woman! They've all come down with whatever that plague of yours is while out searching for %.
9600 : You may be content filling beds in that infirrrmary of yours, but I refuse to subject any of my coalition's staff to your every whim.
9601 : And even if I did send out a whole regiment, eventually we'd pluck the jungle dry.
9602 : Chalvava, may I please have an update on your progress?
9603 : The arboretum's best minds have been toiling day and night, Mistress Svenja, and though our tomatoes have borne fruit, I can't say the same about your hennebloom leaves.
9604 : Would that you had brought me better news... I humbly request your aid--both of your aid--in continuing to pursue this mystery.
9605 : Svenja, I apologize for coming off so harrrshly. Keep your chin up.
9606 : Thank you, Lhe.
9607 : %. You are a sight for sore eyes in these troubling times.
9608 : Inquire about what? Alianne's health. The contagious malady.
9609 : I fear she remains comatose, and her odds of recovery are grim.
9610 : The signs of the plague are there in full. She spent so much time watching out for others that she forgot to take care of herself.
9611 : I had warned her that she would be unable to fulfill her charge should she herself succumb, yet...
9612 : I have requested that all frontier station staff pour resources into investigating the exact cause, but we remain empty-handed.
9613 : It is of little comfort that we have been able to stop the illness from progressing in the afflicted, thanks in no small part to your previous assistance.
9614 : Mistress Svenja!
9615 : Othellius? Should you not be at the infirmary?
9616 : I had been...but then Logan disappeared, and I figured he may have come this way.
9617 : Logan? Here? You must be mistaken.
9618 : I've looked everywhere, but can scarce find neither hide nor hair.
9619 : I made it quite clear that although the remedy may have worked better on him than others, he was to remain under observation until fully recovered. Where could he have gone?
9620 : He went off hunting in the hinterlands!?
9621 : Ugh. Do you pioneers ever think of anything but trampling on all the forest holds dear!?
9622 : My understanding is that Logan was originally stationed in Morimar Basalt Fields.
9623 : Borghest was charged with overseeing the city's work there, was he not? Mayhap he can shed light on our patient's whereabouts.
9624 : Othellius, I bid you accompany %. Your medical expertise will prove pivotal should Logan's condition take a dreadful turn.
9625 : Of course!
9626 : Please, %. He needs you.
9627 : Glad you could make it, %.
9628 : Logan? He's asleep in one of our rooms, and I expect him to make a full recovery.
9629 : But Alianne...her prognosis remains grave. Mistress Svenja is tending to her as we speak.
9630 : I know the two of them would want you to be there during this difficult time.
9631 : Her face is flush and her breathing has returned to normal, yet I fear the worst is not over. She has yet to wake up.
9632 : ...Mmm...
9633 : <Gasp>
9634 : Alianne!
9635 : Mistress...Svenja?
9636 : Oh, Alianne! You had us worried sick!
9637 : Oho! Your friend came to at last!
9638 : Borghest? Why are you and your men here?
9639 : What does it look like? We heard that your friend wasn't in the best condition.
9640 : Borghest...thank...
9641 : Don't fret none, little lady. We figured out the cause of this sickness.
9642 : But...how?
9643 : Are you quite sure?
9644 : Othellius ran all the way here and didn't share the news!?
9645 : The two of us have been so focused on our patients that there was no time for chatter. Please, share with me what you have found.
9646 : How unexpected. Morbol are poisonous enough on their own, but I can scarce imagine the terror of the symbiosis of one of their ilk with so toxic a plant.
9647 : The jungle is full of surprises, isn't it, Svenja? I would have imagined the plant wholly dissolved by the acids in its stomach.
9648 : I cannot thank you all enough for your efforts.
9649 : With the information you have provided us, it is only a matter of time before we discover a proper, fully effective remedy.
9650 : There's some more work to be done, and even if we don't fully know the why, we at least know the what.
9651 : Thank the heavens...
9652 : Morbols traversing their way to Yorcia Weald does not surprise me in the least.
9653 : Historical documents indicate that they originally resided there before the hellfires of the Great Expedition torched half the place. Those not consumed then fled to the basalt fields.
9654 : You've always known your way around a book, Margret.
9655 : One hypothesis is that the morbols consumed the plants in order to rescue them from certain extinction.
9656 : C'mon, Maester. Morbols have no sense of empathy.
9657 : It's just a theory. Although you could go ask them yourself, should you be so inclined.
9658 : The more pressing question is: what drove them out of the basalt fields and into Foret de Hennetiel?
9659 : Y'know, Logan mentioned first clashing with the creature at the Pool of Clarity in Yorcia Weald.
9660 : And this go-around, it was by the Immaculate Sands in Foret de Hennetiel.
9661 : Think maybe it was lookin' for a way to stop the poison of the cursed plant?
9662 : Aha! You may have stumbled onto something the rest of us had overlooked.
9663 : Some people have also been blamin' the umbrils for this whole debacle, all up in arms about icky goop and whatnot.
9664 : It would follow, then, that the morbols may have infected other denizens of Ulbuka as well.
9665 : Now that's somethin' to go on!
9666 : Look alive, slobs! We've got work to do!
9667 : B-b-but we just arrived in town!
9668 : If you don't haul tail, morbols're going to be the least of your problems!
9669 : Eeeeeek!
9670 : Oh, Borghest. He puts up that gruff demeanor, but he's nothing if not reliable.
9671 : Perhaps he was right. We may be able to find a way to protect the sanctity of the jungle while partaking of what she has to offer.
9672 : Othellius...never would I have thought that...you, of all people...
9673 : I have no doubt that the day will come when we can traverse the jungle without bringing her harm, and she will provide us with remedies to all our ills.
9674 : We can only hope.
9675 : %, I have no doubt that you will be one of the [men/women] to lead us toward this brighter future.
9676 : If someone had told me even a short while ago that pioneers from other countries could strengthen our city so, their words would have fallen on deaf ears.
9677 : Despite your status, you have never once forgotten to provide for those less fortunate within the city walls.
9678 : I consider it both an honor and a privilege to have forged a friendship with one whose values are the same as those of my order.
9679 : Please, take this...it may not be much, but it is what I have to give.
9680 : %...come closer.
9681 : While I slept, I had a fanciful dream...a dream of you.
9682 : You were here, in the infirmary, providing respite for the suffering. I watched you glide from room to room, tending to both physical and emotional needs, and thought to myself, One day I would like to be just like [him/her].
9683 : A true pioneer is not just about...colonizing and clearing a path for humanity. A true pioneer...guides people away from harm and...protects them in times of danger.
9684 : One day...%...I, too... ...Thank you...
9685 : There she goes again. A healer's work is never over.
9686 : We have others to attend to, Othellius. Come, let us do for them what % has done for Alianne.
9687 : And Borghest was right. There remains much research to be done if we are to discover a lasting cure.
9688 : Please, %, do not overwork yourself out in the wilds.
9689 : You would not want to see the look on my face if I found you in one of our infirmary beds!
9690 : Thankfully, no new cases of the mysterious illness have been reported in the past few weeks. The Order of Janniston is committed to finding a cure for those who suffer.
9691 : %? You haven't fallen ill, have you? Mistress Svenja would give you the scolding of the century.
9692 : You what? Lost your %?
9693 : Someone delivered it to us the other day, but...that was you? You of all people?
9694 : Ugh. I knew some pioneers didn't properly respect the jungle, but to not respect so precious a gift...
9695 : Of course, I'll return it to you--but you must repay the order in kind.
9696 : A ten-thousand-bayld donation should suffice. After all, you have failed to treat Mistress Svenja's generosity with the proper respect.
9697 : How do you respond? (# bayld) Donate ten thousand bayld. Forget it.
9698 : Then the deal is done. But Altana help you if you lose it again!
9699 : Are you trying to pull the wool over my eyes? That's not enough bayld!
9700 : I knew a pioneer wouldn't be able to appreciate the thoughtfulness of one like our beloved mistress.
9701 : Of course, I'm willing to return your % to you--but you must repay the order in kind with a ten-thousand-bayld donation.
9702 : They've brought the Blackthorn Coven into the city! Into our infirmary! Get them out of there before we're all cursed!
9703 : He's right! We won't stand for any witches in Adoulin!
9704 : Please, everyone, listen!
9705 : Not only have these rusty Weatherspoons failed to protect us from their sorcery, but they now bring the devils straight into the city!
9706 : People of Adoulin! I hear your v-v-voices.
9707 : Please hear mine. Know that we exorcists have in n-n-no way sullied the name of the Order of Weatherspoon.
9708 : Lord Vortimere...
9709 : I will not deceive you. These witches have performed many deeds which cannot easily be f-f-forgotten.
9710 : But make no m-m-mistake--were it not for them, we would not be standing before you this day.
9711 : What did he say?
9712 : The Velkk savages seized a terrifying power and w-w-would have doubtless crushed Adoulin's defenses and slaughtered her people.
9713 : <Gasp>
9714 : Fear not! Through the aid of the Blackthorn Coven and the stalwart efforts of the pioneer %, our order has managed to th-th-thwart their evil plot.
9715 : Adoulin owes these witches...these s-s-saviors, a deep debt of gratitude.
9716 : They...saved us?
9717 : The coven is n-n-no longer an enemy of Adoulin.
9718 : People of Adoulin, w-w-will you not forgive them?
9719 : Why? Why did he drrrag us to Adoulin, of all places? Just being here makes my fur stand on end.
9720 : Well, Sis, between you collapsing and the two of us not far behind, they couldn't very well leave us where we were.
9721 : That Nashu is so naive. How can we rrrest with that angry mob right outside?
9722 : ...Huh?
9723 : Are they...?
9724 : No... I don't believe it. Those idiotarus outside are actually applauding us!
9725 : Hah! I neverrr thought I'd see the day. Can you imagine what folks back home would think?
9726 : I wonder if...we could really live here someday.
9727 : It would seem you have regained your strength.
9728 : Your assistance has gone great lengths in restoring the public's faith in our order.
9729 : That said, I hope you were not intending to stay long.
9730 : Whatever the people may think, you cannot seriously expect our order to welcome you into the city now.
9731 : Hmph. You exorcistarus used us from the beginning, didn't you?
9732 : No wonder... I thought it was all too strange to be true.
9733 : Don't worry. We won't be in your hairrr for long.
9734 : I am glad we have an understanding.
9735 : %...you came.
9736 : You really don't know when to keep your nose-wose out of trouble. That habitaru will get you killed one day, you know?
9737 : But...I'm glad you were with us. We would never-wever have been able to stop that old crocodile without you.
9738 : Truly, you fought with such furrrocity. Call me impressed.
9739 : I always thought our magic would be enough to ward against any threat, but clearly we were wrrrong this time.
9740 : Um...
9741 : Th...thanks.
9742 : ...%? If you ever stop by Western Ulbuka...
9743 : No, never mind.
9744 : Well... I suppose we'd better leave before we dirrrty up the city.
9745 : I don't think we'll everrr be coming back here again. Thanks again, %, and give my regards to Nashu!
9746 : You should have seen the way the Blackthorn Coven skittered out of town.
9747 : An exorcist called Nashu came by to ask about them a while ago. His shoulders slumped when he heard the news.
9749 : Once you pass through these gates, you'll be treading upon the Ceizak Battlegrounds.
9750 : There'll be monsters here, monsters there, monsters monsters everywhere! They'll all be thirsting for blood, too.
9751 : Not another foreigner... Well, you're here, so I guess I have to welcome you to Adoulin.
9752 : I'd prefer it if you got the hell out of my face and never came back. The coalition leaders, however, want you to become a pioneer. Better get on it and register then.
9753 : Pioneers, adventurers, whatever you call yourselves...you're all Velkk scat to me.
9754 : Just don't cause any trouble here in Western Adoulin and things won't get...messy.
9755 : I have been ordered by the Grand Chancellor to assist any pioneers in need.
9756 : Hmmm... Taking another look at you, though, it doesn't seem like you're even registered.
9757 : If you'd like to be a part of this virtuous movement to lead Adoulin to prosperity, just traipse on down the main thoroughfare here until you see a sign with a shovel on it to your left.
9758 : That's the Pioneers' Coalition. Head in and speak to Brenton so he can get you set up with all you need to start colonizing the continent!
9759 : The more developed the continent becomes and the more you contribute to the pioneering effort, the more services the coalitions will provide!
9760 : They'll also look much grander, if you're a fan of architecture and such things. Either way, you've so much to gain by helping the coalitions, so please do!
9761 : I take it you've already hearrrd of the Pioneers' Coalition?
9762 : Then one of Adoulin's many figures you should learn to rrrecognize is Lhe Lhangavo, the coalition's current maester.
9763 : Why, you're not even registered as a pioneer!?
9764 : Pay a visit to Brenton so he can help you start walking the path to fame and fortune. Coincidentally, he's in the building right across from me.
9765 : Pioneers have certainly made a lot of headway recently. Your role in the colonization movement has expanded, and you're more trusted than ever. I don't know exactly how that affects you personally, but I'm sure someone at the various coalitions would.
9766 : I'd suggest staying at this inn if you want to help the local economy, but you have your own Rent-a-Room here in Adoulin, so you should probably use it.
9767 : I know, I know. Many people tell me I'm too kind for my own good, but I just can't leave a cutie out in the lurch. Besides, a pioneer's body is [his/her] temple, so you've got to prove your piety by getting a good rest.
9768 : The risks involved in reaching Adoulin without using waypoints send shiver-wivers down my spine! Not to mention the expenses! The merchant in me is already vomitaruing at the thought!
9769 : Why won't someone from the high and mightaruy Twelve Orders show some kindness for once and throw us a bone? Especially that rascal Chero-Machero! I'm sick and tired of being bamboozle-woozled by him!
9770 : Hidey ho, %. How's all that land reapin' and monster wranglin'?
9771 : Saddle up with as many diff'rent coalitions as possible, and you just might become the prospectin'est pioneer in all of Ulbuka.
9772 : Grub's to be got and schmoozing's to be done up at Castle Adoulin, my little bison-buster.
9773 : Once you meander through the city's winding streets to the castle, pony up your invitation to a guard at the gate and you're ready to ride!
9774 : Just remember that neither herd nor horseman is gettin' through those gates outside the hours of 15 to 22 o'clock.
9775 : Got it? Then dig your spurs in and get a move on! Otherwise there'll be a showdown at the Brenton Corral between the powers that be and me, and the odds aren't in my favor.
9776 : You still busy corrallin' vicious beasts and surveyin' the land?
9777 : Well, keep up the good work, pardner.
9778 : Don't think that since you've done a few good deeds here and there that you can saddle up on your high horse, though. Give your all to diff'rent coalitions and they'll give you back just as much in return.
9779 : I welcome you with open arms to the Pioneers' Coalition!
9780 : Should you desire to register as a pioneer, my arms would open even wider. Or, we could have all our members join hands and hug you all at once, since we'd be like a family! Either way, just head to the desk in back to get started on the greatest adventure of your life!
9781 : Be you another of them would-be pioneers, filled with aspirations and promise? Then saunter on over to the back, there. We'll get you all set up.
9782 : Feeling down? Well save the waterworks for the Waterways, as I always say! Wipe away the tears, here comes the cheer: If we all work together, we can change the continent for the better! Hmmm...still needs some work, I guess.
9783 : If you ever happen to cross paths with the leader of our coalition, don't speak unless you're spoken to. The amount of work she piles on people is enough to turn the sunniest summer afternoon into the dreariest of winter nights.
9784 : Pump those trusty legs of yours on over to the counter there if you'd like to register as a pioneer.
9785 : A word of advice, though, if I may. Should you have the misfortune to bump into our maester, you best be at your most humble lest you find yourself buried under a mountain of work.
9786 : How's the old pioneering been going?
9787 : Now that the Pioneers' Coalition has gotten off the ground a bit, they're handing out items to help during reives and the like.
9788 : We'll be practically throwing provisions at pioneers left and right when the time comes for a reive, so don't forget this weathered old face of mine, okay?
9789 : One day, we shall feel The chaos rushing 'round us Put into order.
9790 : Lo, Geomancy! You're the ebb and flow of land We long to harness.
9791 : Thanks to all the Middle Landers, this town's bristling with more people than hairs on a Mithra!
9792 : Gets me to thinking I should open up my own shop before this boom goes bust. Say, you want in on the ground floor? I think I'll need about three million to start...
9793 : What does the Couriers' Coalition do? Like the name implies, we transport supplies.
9794 : That's why we need better roads. How can we carry stuff efficiently if we have to worry about rocks and potholes?
9795 : No offense meant to you. The more you pioneers explore, the easier it is for us to do our jobs, so keep up the good work!
9796 : ...Oho, a passing adventurer, are we? Well, as you can see, all I do is stand outside this manse all day, so how about indulging me in a talk about Adoulinian history?
9797 : The city is governed by representatives from the Twelve Orders, the original leaders of which were knights who valiantly served the founder king.
9798 : My esteemed employer, Svenja--the minister of public affairs--hails from the Order of Janniston. Her title may sound ambiguous, but it just means that she must try her utmost to make Adoulin a habitable place.
9799 : The leaders of the six coalitions are all termed maesters. I guess it's logical enough, seeing as how they are masters of their trade, but master just doesn't have the same ring to it.
9800 : Anyway, the other half of Adoulin's council seats are filled by the six ministers, for a total of twelve representatives, all belonging to one of the Twelve Orders. ...Yeah, that last name isn't quite so impressive.
9801 : Thanks for listening to me. Not enough people stop and talk to each other these days. In return for your kindness, why don't I tell you a little secret about one of the meisters?
9802 : Rumor has it that Maester Reginald of the Couriers' Coalition is a spy sent from the Middle Lands so that Jeuno can annex Ulbuka and reap its abundant harvests! That's why he's so by-the-book...to cover his tracks!
9803 : How about indulging in some regional delicacies while taking a load off those tired feet of yours?
9804 : Want a way to beat the heat? Try some of the tasty beverages we have on hand.
9805 : What can the Couriers' Coalition do for you? Why, only ensure the integrity of every shipment from origin to destination!
9806 : Speaking of destinations, I'd wager that yours is the Pioneers' Coalition down the road that leads to the western gate.
9807 : What!? You haven't registered as a pioneer yet!?
9808 : Don't give me that I'm undecided crap! Go talk to Brenton in the Pioneers' Coalition before I carry you over there myself!
9809 : You take any offers from the Couriers' Coalition yet? It's never too late to start.
9810 : If you already have, then you might as well take a waypoint! No sense in throwing your back out, right?
9811 : Although...you can't warp to any frontier stations unless you've been to them before, so maybe it doesn't matter for you yet.
9812 : Move it! Out of the way! I'm on my way to breaking my personal speed record for carrying important stuff!
9813 : Nooo! I just realized I have to go west from the city and pass through the Ceizak Battlegrounds!
9814 : I have to deal with all those disgusting vermin as soon as I leave the city!? I'll have to take it slow this time. Well, there goes my bet.
9815 : Under the bridge and to the north, toward Adoulin Waterfront you'll go. Keep walking that way, and then...you'll find an airship dock, oh yay!
9816 : But once you take to the skies, you'll likely die, So we've barred most passengers, you know.
9817 : Please use boats to take you away--ones that dock at the Waterfront all day. There'll be workers there running faster than the west winds blow.
9818 : [Sir/Madame], know you of the Couriers' Coalition? We supervise the domestic transport and inspection of all provisions in a very thorough manner, if I do say so myself.
9819 : I must admit, however, that the impeccable work ethic exhibited by most of our members stems not from passion, but from fear of retribution from the Order of Woltaris.
9820 : I'm transporting stuff for the Couriers' Coalition. What's it look like? Gotta make sure these packages from the waterfront get to whom they should.
9821 : Listen to this. There's a passageway that leads to the Rala Waterways, right?
9822 : Lately, people have been hearing some decidedly grotesque wails and grunts coming from inside.
9823 : The beasts down there are supposedly sealed off with magic, and the Peacekeepers' Coalition has a post down there, so there shouldn't be anything to worry about...I hope.
9824 : Most of the people around here work for the Couriers' Coalition, and I'm no exception.
9825 : We import and export goods, make intercontinental deliveries, and provide supplies to pioneer facilities. I'm not a man of many words, so I'll leave it at that.
9826 : This is indeed the airship docks. I'm sorry if you were hoping to use its services, but we are under strict orders not to allow any civilians on board.
9827 : My sincerest apologies, but our mechanics are currently investigating the source of a problem with our ship's crystal propulsion system.
9828 : The Couriers' Coalition isn't simply an assembly of grunts who carry heavy things long distances. We are the blood that flows swiftly and efficiently through Ulbuka's body, providing it much-needed nutrition.
9829 : Sounds profound, right? That's because they're words from none other than our leader, Reginald. He also has this one: Ulbuka lives and dies by the effort the Couriers' Coalition puts forth.
9830 : What's that? You want to help? How kind of you!
9831 : Follow me, then! It'll take a while, though. The spot I'm in charge of is so far away that I think my boss must have it in for me.
9832 : There's a good reason Velkk are known as the Eventide Savages. They've been trying to raze our sacred city for as long as I remember!
9833 : I don't care what that old tome in the library says! This is our city now, and the Velkk can't have it back!
9834 : Every provision that benefits Adoulin or the pioneering effort passes through this warehouse at some point.
9835 : Too bad these ships wait for no Galka. I go home every night with blisters on my hands. Sometimes even trails of dried tears on my cheeks.
9836 : Jorin's the name and fishin's my game, [sonny boy/little missy]. That's why I'm so int'rested in them pioneers colonizin' Foret de Hennetiel. Hopefully I'll be able to catch me some whoppers when they's done.
9837 : I'd go by myself now, but whatever I fish up be likely doused in Zoldeff River poisons. I remember the last time my wife ate one o' them. She done repainted our interior with what she threw up!
9838 : We've got a doozy of a magic scroll selection, tailored especially to your pioneering needs!
9839 : ...A pioneer, are ya? If that's the case, maybe we've finally found a client for our geomantic plates.
9840 : Why, hello there! If you're looking for geomantic plates, look no further! I don't like to brag, but I'd say our selection is a bit more...sophisticated than what they offer next door.
9841 : Welcome, welcome! Going out into the eye of the jungle's storm? Then the last thing you want is your stomach rumbling during an important battle!
9842 : You ever hear about rrrune fencers?
9843 : They're accomplished sworrrdsmen who make use of runes to snuff out their enemies and empower their friends. Their techniques may have been passed down through the Order of Orvail for generrrations, but even I could use them if I stopped catting around for once.
9844 : Have you tried any of the delectable cuisine Adoulin has to offer?
9845 : With the sea mere yalms away, you'll never want for the freshest of fish and other aquatic life to tantalize your palate!
9846 : Would you care for some of my wares? If you do not, I cannot fault you, but please keep in mind that my revolutionary research into a new Ulbukan toxin antidote will have to be put on hold unless I can accrue the necessary funds.
9847 : Good day, [good sir/fair maiden]! You're certainly not in the Middle Lands anymore, but would you care for some products from your homeland in addition to some more traditional fare?
9848 : Just a short jauntaru over Big Bridge will take you into Eastern Adoulin!
9849 : Coincidentaruly, that's also where the Peacekeepers' Coalition is stationed. We watch over all the citizen-witizens of the city!
9850 : We watch from within guard towers, from upon the city walls, from everywhere! Sometimes our hardened gaze even awakens certain dormantaru feelings with people, which end up coming back to bite us.
9851 : You would be sorely misinformed were you to believe that everyone in Adoulin supports the colonization effort.
9852 : A famous example would be the leader of the Peacekeepers' Coalition, Gratzigg. I personally think that his views on the topic are outdated and overly conservative, but to each his own.
9853 : We shan't be able to colonize Ulbuka if pioneers are overly tired, no?
9854 : We at the Mummers' Coalition work as hard as possible to ensure those providing a brighter future for the continent never lose their ambition. We endeavor to keep morale high by providing festive functions and other joyous events year-round.
9855 : Speaking of our fine institution, this regal estate belongs to Flaviria, the esteemed leader of our coalition. Without her, living in this city would be a much less pleasurable experience.
9856 : This is Adoulin's manufacturing district. There are lots of workshops here.
9857 : Amchuchu, the maester of the Inventors' Coalition, keeps everything running smoothly.
9858 : Sometimes you see her joking with Ikhi Askamot. That's her friend from the Order of Renaye. They look cute together.
9859 : If you came here seeking the brightaruest minds in all of Adoulin, then you're in luck! Welcome to the Inventors' Coalition.
9860 : If you happen to be intarusted in making your creations come to life, make sure to remember our name. You might want to make a note of mine, too, if you want to set up a meeting of the minds.
9861 : Goodness gracious-wacious! You haven't registered as a pioneer yet? Then pay a visitaru to the Pioneers' Coalition along the main thoroughfare to the west.
9862 : Feast your eyes upon one of the best waypoints in all of Adoulin! Why's it one of the best? Because it's an Inventors' Coalition waypoint, that's why!
9863 : ...It would behoove an outsider like you to register as a pioneer before entering our premises, but I will not force you to leave. Take a look around our facilities, but do not interfere with anyone's work.
9864 : It is imperative that you be able to properly use the tools with which we, the Inventors' Coalition, supply you. Otherwise, the colonization effort is doomed to fail.
9865 : Hi there, pioneer! We wouldn't want you going out to the scary jungle on an empty stomach. Stock up on some of our delicious bread for the journey!
9866 : Would you care for some fresh vegetables direct from the Rala Waterways? They're some of our most popular items!
9867 : Hidey ho! Make sure not to forgetaru anything before heading out into the great unknown!
9868 : My mother says that pioneers must have brains as well as brawn.
9869 : I wish to study hard and become a great pioneer soon! Then maybe I can let her take a break from working so often.
9870 : I'm going to train hard and be a pioneer. I'll colonize all of Ulbuka by myself!
9871 : Then I'll bring back the new materials I find. I'll make amazing new inventions with them. No one will call me Milquetoast Merleg ever again!
9872 : The watercraft that dock here transport pioneers and laymen alike to their private island plots replete with a cornucopia of facilities.
9873 : About what would you like to know? Nothing. Send me to my Mog Garden! Visiting others' Mog Gardens. Rent-a-Rooms. Mog Gardens. Expanding my Mog Garden.
9874 : There shall be no stowing away while I'm on watch! Only registered pioneers are allowed aboard this vessel, you imposter!
9875 : If I were to describe what a Rent-a-Room means to pioneers in one word, it would be convenience.
9876 : They are positioned upon deserted islands that came under Adoulin's jurisdiction once the alliance was formed and the old regime abandoned. As for amenities, the Rent-a-Rooms mirror those of similar facilities across Vana'diel.
9877 : We also plan to offer pioneers access to their own personal Mog Garden in the future.
9878 : We are still in the process of applying the finishing touches to these establishments, so I kindly entreat you to bear with us until their completion.
9879 : Mog Gardens are special areas located on the islands dotting the Adoulin Archipelago which have a variety of facilities suited for all your gathering needs.
9880 : Absolutely no fee is required to take advantage of this service.
9881 : We hope that you utilize your Mog Garden to the fullest.
9882 : Now that the Pioneers' Coalition has undergone a certain degree of edification, you are able to expand your Mog Garden!
9883 : What makes this news even more joyous is that should the Pioneers' Coalition fall on hard times and need to consolidate its services, your Mog Garden will still retain its newfound glory.
9884 : You may visit the Mog Gardens of the following party members. Is there anyone's in particular you would care to visit?
9885 : Visit whose Mog Garden? No one's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's.
9886 : Your wish is my command. This way, please.
9887 : I regret to inform you that none of your party members are currently allowing people to patron their Mog Gardens.
9888 : You are currently unable to visit that person's Mog Garden.
9889 : I can't thank you pioneers enough for coming to this continent. I've never seen Adoulin so lively in all my years of trading.
9890 : I might have to invest in a pair of sea legs soon, what with all the ships going back and forth between here and the Middle Lands. Hopefully these mercantile connections will bridge the cultural divisions between our two homes as well.
9891 : Oh deary-weary, just look at those teetering-weetering legs of yours.
9892 : I know how to rid them of their strain! A tarurrific huggy-wug!
9893 : Welcome to the Mummers' Coalition, where the pleasure and prrrosperity of Adoulin's people is our number one goal.
9894 : <Sniff>... Aha! I can smell the adventurer on you from a malm away. Then you should rrregister as a pioneer while you're here.
9895 : Hightail it over to the Pioneers' Coalition just down the rrroad and speak with Brenton. He'll get you all grrroomed and ready to help colonize the continent!
9896 : If you're a fun-loving [lord/lady] looking for a good time, I'd be more than willing to show you to the Mummers' Coalition.
9897 : My, oh my... You're not a pioneer? Then make haste to the Pioneers' Coalition so we can...enliven you as soon as possible!
9898 : Altana's blessed light! That rugged face and those rippling muscles of yours are making me faint of breath! It was almost enough to make me overlook the hint of fatigue in those enchanting eyes.
9899 : What? Our coalition's maester? Why would you want to know about that haggard old biddy!?
9900 : There's nothing attractive about her...unless stinginess flips your switch. Personally, I think I'm much more fabulous than her. Tee hee!
9901 : Oh. My. Goddess. Look at that equipment ensemble! It looks fabulous on you...but I still think I'd wear it better.
9902 : Ugh, not our maester. The mere mention of her makes my hair stand on end!
9903 : All she ever thinks about is how much more bayld she can fit in those loose pockets of hers!
9904 : Haaah, haaah, haaah... Phew, I'm tired. You...wanna know...what I'm doing?
9905 : I'm training extra-amazingly hard to...become a pioneer! My daddy told me that if I ran for more than three hours every day, I'd become strong...like my favorite pioneer, Westillio!
9906 : Sometimes I come home after I'm done and daddy tells me to get out and run even more! He's so good at getting me fired up!
9907 : %? %, it's you, right?
9908 : It's so fantabular to see you again! How has the lifestream been treating you recently?
9909 : And because you're such a super-duper geomancer, I want you to meet my father!
9910 : I...w-wait! It's not what you think!
9911 : I'm not trying to imply that we should tie the knot and that--oh dear! Sylvie, you've gone and done it again!
9912 : This isn't about trying to set you up with him! What a horrible disaster that would be!
9913 : <Huff> Remember all that I told you about how important it was to become one with nature?
9914 : W-well...with all that pioneering I bet you've been up to, you're going to have to figure out a way to blend the two together.
9915 : I mean, I asked my father if he could help you sort through this nonsense. The blending-the-two-together thing, I mean.
9916 : Why? Well, he's also a geomancer participating in the colonization initiative. Birds of a feather grow no moss? Was that it?
9917 : Anyway! I just know he'll be able to help you out! All you have to do is go see him.
9918 : He's working with the people in the first frontier bivouac in Morimar Basalt Fields. Just ask someone there for a man named Hostenn, and I'm sure they'll point you in the right direction!
9919 : My father's a geomancer just like us, %, and can teach you how to destroy nature for the good of mankind.
9920 : Remember, the first bivouac in Morimar Basalt Fields. Ask for Hostenn and I'm sure you'll find him!
9921 : %! My father was so pleased to see how hard you were working, both as a geomancer and as a pioneer!
9922 : He said that the lifestream was strong with you. Best of luck, and don't forget to come see me sometime![ I mean as a friend, not a--well...you know!/]
9923 : Oh no--whatever shall I do!? %, I really need a shoulder to lean on!
9924 : My father...I--I heard news from the basalt fields...
9925 : They asked for his help in clearing safe passage there, b-but...there was word of a monster attack!
9926 : Everyone got scattered and <sniff>...and they say bodies are starting to pile up!
9927 : And Daddy--he's gone missing! I told him it was too dangerous, but he wouldn't listen!
9928 : I-I'm sorry for being overly emotional. I just don't know where to turn, and since you've never let me down before...
9929 : If only I had been a better geomancer, maybe it wouldn't have turned out like this! But no, I'm always bumbling about, causing trouble.
9930 : Sih Renaye, great primal geomancer, if your spirit still slumbers within Adoulin's soil, then I beg of you...
9931 : ...That's it! I'll go ask Ikhi Askamot! You know her, %? She's said to be the reincarnation of Sih Renaye herself.
9932 : Would you go with me to her manor? I know I'm always dragging you places, but please--a friend in need is a penny earned, right?
9933 : And, uh, to be honest, I'm a little scared of going on my own.
9934 : Her residence is in Eastern Adoulin. I've got to gussy up a bit first, but I'll be sure to meet you there!
9935 : Oh, Daddy, I hope you're all right...and that nothing awful happened to you.
9936 : Please, %, come with me and convince Ikhi Askamot to help find him!
9937 : She's likely at the Order of Renaye. I've got to put on my finest if I want to convince her to lend a hand--so I'll meet up with you there!
9938 : Why...why won't they help? It doesn't matter <sniff>... I'll go look for him myself if I have to.
9939 : Oh, %...hi again. Lhaiso told me to get some rest so I could get my wits about me, but it's so hard...
9940 : Would you look at the two of you, prattling away like nothing happened! Did I not tell you to get some rest?
9941 : I have brought Hostenn's body back to Adoulin, so that we can give him a proper funeral. I shall handle all the preparations, darling. No need to worry yourself sick about it.
9942 : Lhaiso, aren't you concerned what the others will think? What with me being a descendant of Zacariah...
9943 : They have got more important things to worry about, what with how I took the great Sih Renaye's bell from its holding place.
9944 : Now that you mention it...what happened out there? I was so upset about Daddy that I didn't even notice.
9945 : What happened back in Morimar? I heard a strange voice. I saw a strange spell cast. I'm not exactly sure.
9946 : Then I was not the only one who heard it. Fascinating!
9947 : Yes, it was a form of traditional magic passed down through the ages, but never before have I had the opportunity to put it to use.
9948 : It was a traditional form of magic passed down from storied geomancer to storied geomancer, and I succeeded in unleashing its power.
9949 : To think the great voice of nature would answer my call, sweets.
9950 : The bell I held in my hands is a treasure not known to the general public--a symbol of the primal geomancer, handed down through the Order of Renaye for generations.
9951 : You see, young ones, whenever she rang the bell she was able to converse with the higher power. Something too big for us to comprehend.
9952 : These conversations are referred to in our annals as the Communion, and it was accepted as a self-evident truth that no one other than the primal geomancer herself was able to engage in the Communion using the bell.
9953 : Lhaiso, that's stupendelicious! I knew you were powerful, but this is just...!
9954 : Sylvie, dear, without the bell I could not possibly have done this--and perhaps I was only able to because of my fervent prayers during a time of great need.
9955 : You see, the reason geomancers carry handbells is so they have a conduit to converse with nature--smaller Communions, if you will, on a much more limited scale.
9956 : And you--%, was it? You have proven yourself to be a highly capable geomancer. Take this bell and use it wisely. It may not have a storied past like the one our order cherishes, but it will surely serve you well.
9957 : And Sylvie, please do let me know your wishes for your father's funeral. We will accommodate you to the best of our ability.
9958 : I don't know if I'll ever be able to get over what happened to Daddy...but I am thankful that the spirits of nature saw fit to save us, at least.
9959 : %, each time we meet you're always so kind to me. I'd like to give you his wand. After all, you were his last pupil--and secretly, I think he liked you most of all.
9960 : I never thought of it this way, but maybe it's an heirloom now? You know what they say--all that glitters has a silver lining.
9961 : It's up to me to return Daddy's spirit back to nature.
9962 : And now that I think about it, his body, too. As a descendant of Zacariah, it's my familial duty.
9963 : %, I've been meaning to thank you again.
9964 : Lhaiso's been so wondermentous with making arrangements for Daddy's funeral, but things are never as smooth as you want them to be, right?
9965 : Why? Because I'm of Zacariah's blood. Yes, that Zacariah--one of the five disciples of Sih Renaye.
9966 : Some stories claim that Zacariah was a traitor who betrayed the other geomancers.
9967 : They even go so far as to say that the great primal geomancer died because of his betrayal.
9968 : That's why they think he incurred the wrath of nature...and why all of his descendants are shunned.
9969 : As if that weren't reason enough, the whole hullabaloosy-whatsit about pioneering--and how Daddy was involved in it--means that many of the Order of Renaye's geomancers will have nothing to do with Daddy's funeral.
9970 : Having heard all this, I'm sure that you don't want to help me anymore...right?
9971 : Will you help Sylvie? We've come this far together! Well, it is a tad upsetting...
9972 : I...understand. You aren't the first to think that way, and I'm sure you won't be the last, either.
9973 : I... Thank you, %.
9974 : There is something in particular that I need help with.
9975 : My family is traditionally buried in Cirdas Caverns, though Adoulin's politics have made it difficult at times.
9976 : And with so many acuexes there, the entourage is having a tough ride.
9977 : It would help so much if I had a few % from those stupid things for use in the ceremony.
9978 : I don't care how you get ahold of them, %, but would you mind bringing me # )?
9979 : It'd be a monumentacular help, and you'd refine your geomancering skills, too! Killing two birds is in the eye of the beholder and stuff.
9980 : Lhaiso has been so wonderful in helping prepare for the burial ceremony.
9981 : But it'd go even faster if you'd lend a hand. Do you remember what I asked you to get me?
9982 : Why, that's right, %! # ) from the acuexes. You're much better at remembering these things than I would be!
9983 : Oh, %, you've brought the % just like I asked! You're always so wonderful to me!
9984 : It was the funeral to end all funerals, thanks to you and Lhaiso!
9985 : The Zacariah line's traditional burial spot is deep within the eastern section of the caverns, where a green stone sticks out from the ground. That's where Daddy's final resting place is.
9986 : Hmm... Now that I think about it, I should probably go perform the traditional Zacariah prayer ritual there.
9987 : If you find yourself in the area, %, I'd like you to stop by and pay your respects. Daddy would have appreciated that.
9988 : You'll find a green tombstone deep in the eastern recesses of Cirdas Caverns. Daddy has been buried there, together with our ancestors.
9989 : I've got these % that you brought me. That should be what I need to perform the Zacariah bloodline's sacred ritual.
9990 : The only thing that would make me happier would be if you went to offer your prayers to Daddy, too.
9991 : %, have you had a chance to visit the Order of Renaye in Eastern Adoulin yet?
9992 : Lhaiso told me to have you go see her. What do you think she wants? Think she'll give you some kind of medal? That would be wondabular!
9993 : W-wow! Ikhi really gave you %!? Congratulations! I couldn't be happier if I had received it myself!
9994 : If you need anything else as a geomancer, you should go see Wescolina here in Western Adoulin. She's got things that'll help you bring out your true geomanterrific powers!
9995 : She's one of the Order of Renaye's most trusted individuals, and will definitely whip up something good for you!
9996 : %, I heard the most terrible rumor! They think I poisoned Lhaiso!
9997 : That's just beyond mean! She listened to me, and helped me when no one else would! I'd never do anything to hurt her!
9998 : I know I'm not the bestest geomancer in the world, but even I can tell that what's wrong with her is caused by some terrible force.
9999 : One of my older geomancer buddies said that it's getting harder to tap into the lifestream.
10000 : If that's true, then the changes in the fabric of the earth would be affecting Ikhi and Lhaiso more than anyone else, right?
10001 : I'm worried. Very worried. Would you mind going to the Order of Renaye and checking up on them with me?
10002 : I'd go by myself, b-but they'd just... If you're with me, though, they'd have to let us in!
10003 : How cruel must they be to think I poisoned Lhaiso? I mean, do I look like I'm capable of doing that?
10004 : But I shouldn't be here rambling. I need to talk to them about the forces of nature here within Adoulin.
10005 : %, we have to see if the rumors about the unraveling of nature are true. To the Order of Renaye--and hurry!
10006 : We've got to head to Cirdas Caverns to talk with the higher power!
10007 : I'll meet you by the green tombstone in the eastern part of the caverns, just like before. I hope nothing bad happens when we're there...but we'd better go prepared!
10008 : %! I've been waiting for you for ages and ages! Have you heard about Lhaiso...?
10009 : Hoho, word of your adventures rings throughout the city, young ones!
10010 : The two of you rrreally pulled this one out of the fire. How...how can we ever thank you?
10011 : Everything was thanks to %! If it weren't for [his/her] excellanimous Communion, I don't know what would have happened!
10012 : Either way, you both have blossomed into truly inspiring geomancers. %, with your strong will...
10013 : ...and Sylvie, with you and your kin who have served to watch over all.
10014 : On behalf of geomancers of all stripes and colors, I would like to apologize. Not only for our words and actions, but for my inability to bring an end to this terrible feud.
10015 : I...I don't know what to say...
10016 : The very fact that your worrrds reached the higher power surely spells the end of our ill treatment of Zacariah's legacy.
10017 : Ikhi, I... <Sniff> I'm so happy to <sob>...hear you say that!
10018 : Ah! I almost forgot to ask you to please return Sih Renaye's bell.
10019 : You have my thanks. This bell is a prized heirloom of our order, and by rights it must be passed down to Ikhi.
10020 : Together with all the grave responsibilities that accompany it.
10021 : I have high hopes for geomancers like you, %, and present you with a sign of my sincerity.
10022 : Ikhi, thank you... Thank you so much.
10023 : %, you are more than deserving of this.
10024 : It is traditional geomancer attire--and the color suits your complexion perfectly.
10025 : I look forward to seeing you again--this time flying your geomancer colors strong and proud!
10026 : But we...will be rrrather busy, Lhaiso, given the work we must do regarding Zacariah and his teachings.
10027 : To think, the student telling the master that it is time to work. <Sigh>
10028 : Then let us roll up our sleeves and proceed, shall we?
10029 : Daddy--and my ancestors--must be so proud of how hard we worked, %.
10030 : I know I brought you into this whole geomancer fold thing, but I guess now it's my turn to look up to you!
10031 : I, too, pledge [to bring harmony to nature in Adoulin./to protect Adoulin's natural environment./to do everything possible to save nature.]
10032 : %, I'm so happy we've gotten the chance to know each other--not just as geomancers, but as friends.
10033 : If we all put our minds to it, we can make Adoulin the most nature-y place on Vana'diel! Birds of a feather are thicker than water, after all!
10034 : Ah sweah by Altana hehself the ol' hubby o' mine nevah come outta his workshop fo' nothin'!
10035 : Well you be one o' Hostenn 'n Sylvie's trainees, is it? Dun that jus' beat all!
10036 : Have you been trained by them? They've been great mentors. Never heard of them.
10037 : These ol' ears musta been failin' me, 'cause Ah coulda swoah they ha' mentioned somethin' 'bout you, sweet darlin'.
10038 : Ah knows 'em when Ah sees 'em, that's fo' right and foah sure. Gotta be these ol' eyes o' mine.
10039 : Ah be a diss'nt relative o' ol' Sylvie 'n Hostenn. That's right, Ah gots the blood o' Zacariah runnin' through these veins o' mine. 'Course Ah canna say that too loud-like 'roun' heah.
10040 : My hubby, he 'n Ah work togetha to make all sorts o' attire for those who folla th' way. Th' way o' the geomanceah, that is.
10041 : Sylvie dun tol' me that you got a bona fide % as part o' your geomanceah duties, 's right?
10042 : You tried usin' it yet? Sweet Goddess above, those things pack quite th' wallop!
10043 : They come from th' earth, y'know. Draw forth its powah like a dog herdin' bison, boy howdy! But they ain't th' only thin's that do so, my loveleh.
10044 : If'n you brin' me somethin' special, Ah reckon Ah can whip you up a little geomanceah attiah like nothin'!
10045 : Ol' Hostenn woulda liked that too.
10046 : 'N just thinka the pride it'd bring down on us Zacariahs. You'd bettah git on th' stick if'n we're gonna promote our bloodline!
10047 : 'Course, if we got a chocobo eatin' outtah our hands, best close the gate before we give 'em the sugah. So? From what part should we start?
10048 : Which piece will you order? %. %. %. Nothing at this time.
10049 : You want %, sweet pea?
10050 : Do you want %? Absolutely. Let me reconsider.
10051 : Ah be needin' a little somethin' special to make that one for you. Let's see... %, %, %, and %.
10052 : Ah'd say it's as easah as pie, dumplin', but we both know gettin' 'em will be like pullin' teeth from an umbril. You get your grubby li'l paws on the % in [Moh Gates/Dho Gates/Sih Gates]. A fabled geomanceah was said to perform a ritual of [fire/water/air] theah.
10053 : Much as Ah like you, sweet cheeks, Ah'll be needin' a bit o' bayld for mah services. # should suffice.
10054 : Ah can use that monah to get a li'l somethin' for that poor Sylvie. That girl mus' be sadder 'n a no-legged dog playin' fetch. You're suah that you want %, right?
10055 : Are you pleased with your choice? Actually, another piece might be better. Consider my order complete!
10056 : Ain't that just right as rain! Ah'll get started right 'way!
10057 : Make sure you prepeah mah fee in the meantime, sweetheaht. You don't wanna see mah face when Ah dun get paid!
10058 : Peaches 'n cream, it's %! Dun worry your pretty little head--Ah remembah your ordah of one %.
10059 : And how's your hunting goin', pet? Ah need %, %, %, and...what was it?
10060 : That's right, %. Ah sweah, 'times Ah dun know wheah my head is at.
10061 : 'N on top o' all that, dun forget that Ah be needin' a small fee of # bayld to bring the chickens home to roost.
10062 : First, though, Ah need those four items.
10063 : We can discuss payment aftah that.
10064 : Well, Ah'll be swanned, %! You brought me exactly what Ah need. Ready for me to make you your %?
10065 : Let me just lay mah eyes on them... %, %, %, 'n %. Dun that just beat all!
10066 : Now we can talk about the sugah you owe me. Remember--Ah need # bayld. Speak to me again when you're reddah. (Bayld: #.)
10067 : Come back with the right amount o' bayld, %? It comes to #.
10068 : Pay # bayld? (Bayld: #) Of course! Let me think some more.
10069 : Aftah all that time gatherin' materials, you're gon' back out on me now? Altana above, make up yo' min'!
10070 : Have you got cotton in your ears, %? You dun have the # bayld Ah need!
10071 : Mercy! A sweet young [man/woman] who listens to [his/her] eldahs is such a treat in these troublin' times.
10072 : Ready to start, %?
10073 : 'Course, Ah'm not th' one doing th' work. That be up to my husband. 'Times he be workin' real hard, other times he's as useless as tits on a bull. Hopefully he comes up aces this time.
10074 : Ah'll give you this li'l piece o' paper--a receipt, I 'ppose. Come back in a li'l while and hopefully it'll be reddah.
10075 : Hut-tut! These things take time, %. You come back a bit lateah, hear?
10076 : Ain't this % just the prettiest thing you ever did saw?
10077 : 'N with this perfect fit, y'all be as snug as a bug in a rug.
10078 : 'Smore, the % you brought me shore did give it a bit o' a kick!
10079 : Shouldn't surprise you none. After all, geomanceahs need th' power o' nature to work their magics.
10080 : % be harnessin' the power o' flame. Not just in a magical way, but in somethin' a tad more primal.
10081 : Nature 'tis be a mystery. Dun know 'bout you, but Ah canna explain it for nothin'. Jus' like people, I 'ppose.
10082 : Think of it maybe like a father's love, fixin' what went wrong and helpin' his sons 'n daughters become bettah people.
10083 : Fire can destroy, like a whopper o' a volcano eruptin', or be used for good, like temperin' metal. That hubby o' mine sometimes shows some ol'-fashioned flashes of insight, y'see.
10084 : But that's not heah nor theah. Th' important thing is that you look like such a darlin' in the getup!
10085 : Saints alahve, %! We finished your %!
10086 : Should be as smooth as a baby's bottom 'n never lose its shine or colah. Depends how well you take care of it, Ah 'ppose.
10087 : Y'know, though, 'tis all thanks to th' % y'brought me. Some high-quality stuff, 'twas.
10088 : Remembah way back when Sylvie had you use some dirt to create your luopan?
10089 : Just like that soil, th' % has some ol'-fashioned salt o' the earth, together with th' healin' powers o' water--th' very trunks o' nature herself.
10090 : Usin' that power 'n inscribing some magic 'pon the surface...
10091 : ...Brings out th' potential to change th' very nature of th' world! ...or so Ah hope.
10092 : Least that's what that hubby o' mine says. Maybe you can get some good learnin' from his words.
10093 : Far as Ah'm concerned, the important thin' is that you look good--quite [dashin'/'dorable] too, I do declare!
10094 : Praise Altana, %, your % came out all perfect-like.
10095 : What did that style lady from the Middle Lands always say? Fashion starts with th' feet. Ah'm gonna take those words and treat 'em like mah own.
10096 : Y'know why this works so well t'gether? It's all 'cause of th' % you brought me.
10097 : Wind is th' most cyclical of all elements, takin' nature 'n refreshin' it with each small breeze--and your % was chock full o' wind magic.
10098 : Geomanceahs go on all manner o' journeys to become one with nature, see?
10099 : These shoes, darlin', will surely guide you through nature's cycle, and you'll never feah fatigue or be burdened by waste.
10100 : That's what mah hubby says, anyway, so maybe take it with a huge helpin' o' salt.
10101 : 'Tween the two of us...I think I'm the one with th' most wisdom in our little family. Uwaha!
10102 : By the Goddess, %--Ah was just thinkin' 'bout you. Here t'get s'more work done?
10103 : Can't blame you. 'Fter all, once you feel our work 'pon your skin, you just can't get enough!
10104 : So? What can Ah do you for?
10105 : Lookin' for the final piece to complete your ensemble, yes? Does a lady's heart proud to know her work's 'ppreciated--but to be honest, Ah'm a bit hesitant.
10106 : But still--I hear you've been done some good work out in th' wildlands, so I was right t' offer mah services to you.
10107 : Far be it from me t'pass judgment. Last thin' you needed was th' %, was it?
10108 : Ah'll be needin' %, %, %, 'n %.
10109 : Ah'd say it's as easah as pie, dumplin', but we both know gettin' 'em will be like pullin' teeth from an umbril. You get your grubby li'l paws on the % in [Moh Gates/Dho Gates/Sih Gates]. A fabled geomanceah was said to perform a ritual of [fire/water/air] theah.
10110 : 'N dun forget the bayld, sweetheart! Jus' like 'fore, Ah be needing #!
10111 : Altana take the wheel, %!
10112 : Ah be needin' you to help spread th' word o' Zacariah--'n it'll help Sylvie out too!
10113 : I can't believe it! That flop of a duo causes prrroblem after problem and sucks all the life out of the room--and now they're late!
10114 : I hirrred them to serve as novice entertainers for those from the Middle Lands, and no one crrracks so much as a smile.
10115 : Forrrget making a quick bit of catnip--I can't even rrrecoup my investment!
10116 : No, it's my own fault for brrringing them here in the first place.
10117 : I've got to unearth those dolts before they get into even more trrrouble!
10118 : On top of it all, their managerrr quits, leaving me to play a game of cat and mouse. They're so off-kilter I might need to call in a favor from the Order of Thurandaut! Maybe get me a raptorrr or two.
10119 : Rrraptors? No, I need something with hands...
10120 : Oh-ho! Another visitor, I see. Here to apply to be a purrrformer?
10121 : (<Sigh> With that grrrim look on [his/her] face, [he'd/she'd] just scare the audience away. Oh, Altana, why can't you bring me some real talent?)
10122 : So, what is it you do, then? Crrroak out a tune? Two-left-feet your way to miserrry? Just don't tell me you're going to bring the house crashing down with your jokes!
10123 : So that must mean that... You want to be a managerrr!
10124 : We'd be just tickled pink to have you! (Yes, yes...this is a golden opportunity for success. I must rope [him/her] in before [he/she] rrrealizes what [he's/she's] getting into...)
10125 : Well, you're in for a bit of luck! We have a chance opening for a new managerrr...something that only happens once every few yearrrs.
10126 : Of course, there's a bit of a grrrooming period first, but I can see in your eyes that you're a lion of a worker!
10127 : But I've skipped over the self-intrrroduction, haven't I? My name is Peladi Shalmohr.
10128 : And you?
10129 : %? A name befitting one with your flairrr, to be sure.
10130 : So let's get starrrted right away, hmm? Money doesn't make itself!
10131 : [Good to go?/Ready to hit it off?] You bet! Um, no? Manager? Me? Uhhh...
10132 : Outstanding! Your firrrst duty as manager is to find our newest comedians-in-training: Tarutaru Sauce.
10133 : How will you rrrecognize them? Well, one has hair shaped like %.
10134 : And the otherrr's hair looks like rotten %.
10135 : Well, together they're like %. They've got heads, but nothing to fill them.
10136 : What are you standing arrround for? Pounce to it! (For the love of all that is sacrrred, find them before they cause more trouble...)
10137 : You forgot what they looked like already? <Sigh> Let me rrrun it by you once more.
10138 : Now listen good: there's only room for one managerrr, and if you can't perform your duties, there's a whole legion of people who're willing to take your place!
10139 : %, you were borrrn to be a manager! I can feel it in my tail! Rrready to make a splash in the entertainment world?
10140 : (Come on, come on...I can't let this fish slip through my paws...!)
10141 : The best part of being the top cat is the fame and forrrtune that comes with success!
10142 : This is a unique opportunity for you. You'd never forgive yourself if you let it slip from your grrrasp!
10143 : Something about this seems funny...but you can't quite put your finger on it.
10144 : I could really go for some sweetaru trail cookies right now. But the good-for-nothing manager never pays us on time!
10145 : I understand why--we're just rookies-wookies.
10146 : B-but...my tummy-wummy... You think we could find work as gourmet journalistarus?
10147 : Comedic talentaru like us have to be well-rounded, after all!
10148 : Come on, the juicy-wuiciest work is reserved for performers who've been at it for years and years.
10149 : My heady-wead hurts...couldn't they at least let us practice?
10150 : This is perfectaru! We'll get that %-headed [guy/girl] to help us out!
10151 : Um, excuse me, [sir/ma'am]? We're a really famous comedic duo...I think. I betaru you want our autographs, right?
10152 : Ask them to sign something? Wonderful idea! Not on your life. Wait...are you Tarutaru Sauce?
10153 : Why, of course you do! They're gonna be worth, like, a million-willion gil!
10154 : %'s tummy started rumbling.
10155 : Speak up, now. I couldn't quite hear you.
10156 : Why, a supporter-worter! This is wonderful!
10157 : We've made it to the big time, Musto-Rusto!
10158 : (<Gulp> A...a fan? What do we do? I've never inky-winked an autograph before...)
10159 : (Are you daftaru? Just throw something down on the paper and [he/she]'ll be fawning all over it!)
10160 : Oh deary-wear. I left my pen and paper in my other pocketaru. What to do, what to do...
10161 : Our fans adore us so much that we always try to keep something on us to autograph, but we're so popular that we ran outaru!
10162 : (I toldy-wold you, we've never done this before!)
10163 : That's why we gotta make money! So we can buy pens and paper!
10164 : Ok, listen. Our plan is to reportaru on the greatest foodstuffs of Adoulin...but without practice, no one will hire us!
10165 : So I command you! Find me some scrumptious-wumptious ingredients. Then we can talk about that autograph.
10166 : (W-wasn't that a bit forceful?)
10167 : (They say the way to a Tarutaru's heartaru is through his stomach. Still, it's astounding how eloquentaru you become when food's involved, Tuffle-Buffle...)
10168 : But even with ingredientarus, who will cook up these delightful meals for us?
10169 : Hahaha...
10170 : Who else, silly-willy? Can't you tell by my stunning Culinarians' Guild outfitaru?
10171 : 'Course, I always was better at eating...
10172 : Don't try to obfuscataru the truth! You put on that outfit, snuck into the guild, and inhaled everything on the shelf! And then tried to make a break for it when they found you!
10173 : It's not my faultaru that their foul mushroom souffl made me lose my lunch!
10174 : But what's importantaru right now isn't the past--it's the future! A lovely, sugar-coated future!
10175 : First, however, we start with the hors d'oeuvres!
10176 : You know what would really whetaru my appetite? %.
10177 : Musto-Rusto, you're in chargey-warge of the hard part. Tell [him/her] the recipe!
10178 : Me!? You just said that you're the chef de partie of Vana'diel! Why are you push-wushing it off on me?
10179 : <Sigh> To make %, you'll need...
10180 : Who would add % to that!? With the way they wiggle in my stomach, I might as well become a streetaru performer!
10181 : With a tummy like yours, the only street performance you'd be able to do would be belly-welly dancing!
10182 : I can hear the pangs of starvation-wation taking root! Bring me the stuff before I wither on the vine!
10183 : You can forgetaru about the %, but not the crystal! Remember the crystal!
10184 : Forgotten already? Did you hitaru your head on a doorframe? Listen carefully, and take notes this time!
10185 : What is this emptiness I feel? My body-wody...so weak...
10186 : I feel faintaru...please...you must...
10187 : Geez, how long could it possibly take to find some %??? You're just lucky-wucky I'm not any more emaciatarued than I already am!
10188 : OK! Let's get to it!
10189 : %'s cooking skill rises by 0.1!
10190 : Synthesis failed. Tuffle-Buffle lost the crystal he was using.
10191 : % was lost.
10192 : These pangy-wangs of hunger...I can't focus...
10193 : Now waitaru a sec! Are you trying to pass off your failure as some kind of success!?
10194 : S-sorry...can you pleasey-wease gather some more ingredients for me?
10195 : Tuffle-Buffle synthesized # %.
10196 : I told you, Musto-Rusto! You can always expectaru the best from the king of the kitchen! That ol' guild leader better watch out, because a new chef is in town--and his name is Tuffle-Buffle! Just give me a few more hours...
10197 : Hours!? I thought you were starving!
10198 : Oh, forget it. Now, hurry and give the gourmet reportaru!
10199 : Hmm... It clings to the teeth like a sticky-wicky piece of candy... Reminds me of %...
10200 : Its pungentaru stench and overpowering aftertaste... It's...it's...wonderful!
10201 : More like something you would just throw in the trashy-wash!
10202 : And how would you compare it to %? Like you've ever eaten-weaten one before!
10203 : All this complaining doesn't befitaru you. You should be on your knees thanking me for such a wonderful, detailed analysis!
10204 : Oh, hush. Now, time for the main dish!
10205 : <Sigh> Can you do anything else besides eataru?
10206 : Are you trying to killy-will me? What idiotaru would put % in that!?
10207 : Musto-Rusto, you're trying-wying to become Sous-Chef Supreme, aren't you!?
10208 : What are you thinking? Our dream is to become the best comedic duo-wuo in all of Vana'diel, not to be slaving over a hot stove for hours on end!
10209 : And if I were going to kill you, I'd come up with something more directaru.
10210 : See that, Musto-Rusto? A perfectaru combination of flavor and love! I'll be the head of the Bridge of Dreams before you know it!
10211 : If you want it to go bankruptaru, you mean.
10212 : <Munch>...<munch>... Yes, the oil coats the roof of my mouth... It's like slurping-wurping on %...
10213 : The meaty juices assaultaru my throat with the fury of a thousand Moblins. Outstanding!
10214 : We've partaken of appetizers and devoured the main course. All that's left is dessertaru!
10215 : All this moaning-woaning about recipes... I bet you don't even know them, do you?
10216 : Oy oy! What's the big idea adding %? You're hoping to send me to sleepy-weep with the fishes, aren't you?
10217 : All of Vana'diel will be bawling and writhing in anguish if I kick the bucketaru!
10218 : Bawling and writhing? More like dancing and singing.
10219 : What'd I tell-well you, Musto-Rusto? Next stop: headmaster at the School of Magic!
10220 : What happened to the whole head chef idea!? Plus, Professor Koru-Moru won't be happy-wappy to hear you want to usurp him!
10221 : And besides, we're too lowbrow for something so magnificentaru!
10222 : Hmm... This is crunchy-wunchy... Feels good on the teeth... It's just like eating %...
10223 : It leaves sharp pricklies in my mouthy-wouth... Yes, this is stupendous!
10224 : What kind of idiotaru are you? I trusted you when you said a comedian makes ten times as much as a mage!
10225 : And that look in your eye--you don't want to actually do a gourmet report. You just want to stuff your facey-wace!
10226 : How darey-ware you! Who was the one who ate your lunch so that the headmastaru wouldn't find out you were wasting food!?
10227 : You...you...you Goblin-brained nitwitaru!
10228 : Why I oughta...!!!
10229 : It-it was you who scarfed down my lunchy-wunch when I wasn't looking!?
10230 : You obnoxious onion-wonion-head!
10231 : Enough, you two!!!
10232 : How many times do I have to rrremind you--if you don't practice your schtick, you'll never make it out of the litter box!
10233 : Ack!!!
10234 : Sweet heavens, it's the cheap! Ruuuuuun!
10235 : Cheap!? Who are you calling cheap!? It's chief, you ungrateful morrrons!
10236 : <Sigh>...
10237 : I do owe you my thanks, however. Tarrrutaru Sauce didn't get into any major mischief.
10238 : Congrrratulations! You've officially passed the test!
10239 : ...Their autogrrraph!? It wouldn't be worth the paper it's written on!
10240 : Besides, how are they going to know how to do autographs without you, their managerrr, to guide them?
10241 : Here, give them a sample by wrrriting down your name on this con...paper.
10242 : You write your name on the parchment.
10243 : Wonderful! Now you're a true apprrrentice manager in my employ!
10244 : Oh, and one more thing. Apprentice managers don't get a salary. Work hard, and maybe we can rrrenegotiate at a later date.
10245 : Well? What are you waiting arrround for?
10246 : Go and chase afterrr those two incompetent fools!
10247 : You have earned the trust and respect of Peladi Shalmohr! ...Probably.
10248 : <Mutter> With those two running around, I can't even focus on my worrrk...
10249 : %! Don't forrrget the most important task at hand--keep Tarutaru Sauce out of trouble, or your days as an apprentice manager are numbered!

10262 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. I have been appointed by the Guildworkers' Union to manage the trading of manufactured crafts and the exchange of guild points.
10263 : However, to assure product quality, I cannot carry out any business with those who rank lower than novice.
10264 : I see that you currently have a trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild. I'm sorry, but I cannot do any business with you.
10265 : You do have the option to terminate your contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and form one with us.
10266 : After signing a new contract, you will have to wait until the next delivery phase to trade Guildworkers' Union requested items.
10267 : Create a new contract with us? Immediately. Not today.

10269 : You have terminated your trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
10270 : Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.
10271 : If you happen to create a high quality version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.
10272 : Trading us these items will earn you guild points which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.
10273 : The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.
10274 : When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.
10275 : I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.
10276 : If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.
10277 : You have formed a new trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
10278 : The current requested item is %. You have # guild points accumulated.
10279 : Currently, no items are being requested by the guild. You have # guild points accumulated.
10280 : Is there something you need? I'm just passing through. I would like to use my points. What are the current limits? How does the trade system work?
10281 : You have # more days (Vana'diel time) to provide us with the requested item.
10282 : Today (Vana'diel time) is the final day we will accept the requested item.
10283 : You can still receive up to # guild points by trading us the item before the time limit is up.
10284 : You are not eligible to receive guild points at this time.

10308 : %...# gil... %...# gil...
10309 : Masad, you good-for-nothing currr! Just how much is it!?
10310 : I-it's a total of...# gil, chief!
10311 : # gil!? Are you kidding me!?
10312 : %, get over here!
10313 : Tell me, [Mr./Ms.] Managerrr...just what do you think the gil we're talking about is for?
10314 : What is the money for? I haven't the foggiest. My salary! Do you mean to tell me...
10315 : Your extrrreme honesty is so refreshing...
10316 : ...Not in your wildest drrreams!
10317 : You're as unfathomably stupid as a mouse repeatedly caught in the same trrrap!
10318 : As impudent as you are ugly, I see. I have to say, I like your gumption...
10319 : Did you forget that you're at the bottom of this scrrratching post!? You'll get no pay until you've shown you're not totally useless!
10320 : Oh? You think you have an idea of what the money's for? You rrreally catch on quick, don't you? You must even think I'm impressed.
10321 : Stop prrretending that your head is filled with something other than cobwebs!
10322 : Tarutaru Sauce--that's right, your Tarutaru Sauce--has been rrrunning up a tab at vendors all throughout the city--and this is their total bill!
10323 : Those bumbling morrrons spend all their time eating their way throughout the city, but mysteriously never-wever have time for work.
10324 : It's all because a certain someone hasn't been managing them prrroperly. Now, who do you think that could be?
10325 : That's rrright, %, you! All this is your fault!
10326 : Paying their tab is your rrresponsibility!
10327 : Why're you still standing around here like a dead trrree in Yorcia Weald!? Hurry up before they rrrack up more expenses, you lazy good-for-nothing!
10328 : <Sigh> Even that rrravenous Galka acquaintance of mine doesn't inhale as much as those two...
10329 : Ah...ah... Achoo!
10330 : Urk, I musta caught this cold from staying close to the pier for too long.
10331 : Need somethin'? Oh, you're here from the Mummers' Coalition. Must be about the tab, then.
10332 : Pleasure doin' business. You're always welcome here!
10333 : Why, hello there! Here about that tab those two Tarus ran up?
10334 : Thanks for your patronage! Must be tough keeping after them, but if you're ever in need of some sweet desserts to calm your nerves, you know where to find me!
10335 : Hmm? Oh yes--the two Tarus' tab.
10336 : Thank you so much! My bread is always the freshest, so stop by after work and buy some, okay?
10337 : What do you mean, I don't know where to go? You've got the invoice rrright in front of you! Now get crrracking before the coalition collapses under the weight of their collective behinds!
10338 : You handed over the % and the %.
10339 : Finally finished, are we?
10340 : Well? Stop flounderrring about here and find those two idiots!
10341 : Get your rrrear in gear and catch those fools before it's too late!
10342 : My tummy-wummy feels like it's going to collapse in on itself if I don't get some num-nums soon! Why won't that stupid manager pay our tab?
10343 : But we're just apprentices, so we can't expectaru her to do anything for us...
10344 : Then we've got no other option-woptions--time to break into the raptor pens and munch on some rockberries!
10345 : R-rockberries!? Have you lostaru your mind?
10346 : (Then again, we're talking about Tuffle-Buffle...eating is ninety-five percentaru of what he does...)
10347 : Aha! Musto-Rusto, look who it is!
10348 : You there! We heard from our manager-wanager that you're the one who's supposed to be looking after us!
10349 : So this means you can forgetaru about that signature!
10350 : (Then...why did he make me stay up all night, day after day, practicing-wacticing cursive!?)
10351 : (Oh, wait...it's common courtesy to greetaru someone when you meet them.)
10352 : Why, uh...hello! Congratulations on being put in chargey-warge of us, I suppose...
10353 : I don't know why, but our last boss quitaru before we could even catch her name. I wonder why that was...
10354 : Come one, come all and savorrr our lovely %, made with our most delectable vegetables!
10355 : Yes, it does look positively exquisite. Might I bother you for a taste?
10356 : Mmm... This is simply divine!
10357 : Absolutely lovely. I simply must have one of these %.
10358 : Coming rrright up! You know, they're taken fresh from the Rala Waterways!
10359 : Then I had best bring them home and start cooking before they lose their flavor!
10360 : And in thanks for your lovely products, I would like to give you one of these sweets I am bringing home for dessert.
10361 : %? For me?
10362 : Oooh, if therrre's one thing I love as much as vegetables, it's dessert!
10363 : I am pleased that you like it.
10364 : (Oh-ho-ho, free sample-wamples...)
10365 : (That twinkle-winkle in his eye can only mean one thing... ...he's thinking about food again.)
10366 : (This is perfect! I'll just have to keep changing-wanging our clothes and visitaru the stall several times--that'll keep me full for sure!)
10367 : Hey, [big man/little lady] in charge! We gotta change outfitarus.
10368 : We're performer-wormers, right? We can't be seen wearing the same tired old rags each day!
10369 : Outfitarus? Tuffle-Buffle, you don't have any outfitarus.
10370 : Ever since we droppy-wopped out of the School of Magic, you've worn the same thing over and over.
10371 : Tohoho, my little-wittle friend. You just don't know how much of a fashionistaru I am!
10372 : It's been decided! Select something exquisitaru from my personal collection!
10373 : What would you like them to change into? The %. The %. The %. The %. The %.
10374 : You surey-wure about this?
10375 : Pleased with your choice? That would look faaabulous. Not so much...
10376 : Wh-why are you only using-wusing the headpiece!?
10377 : I suppose I should forgivey-wive you, Musto-Rusto. A plebian cannot possibly be expectarued to grasp the intricacies of the fashion world.
10378 : And besides...my only shirts and pantarus are from the Culinarians' Guild.
10379 : Yet my unique-wique head-only statement will overtake the world like a mighty flood!
10380 : A flood of tears, you meany-wean.
10381 : Time to take this out for a spinny-win and show it off to the adoring public!
10382 : Why, of course I will deign-weign to partake of your offering!
10383 : Wait...haven't I seen you beforrre?
10384 : Unforrrtunately, I can only offer one per customer.
10385 : Hey, you big oaf! The clothes you chose for us were anything but a hitaru! How are we going to make our fans swoony-woon with a getup like this?
10386 : I'm completely pooped! Time to take a restaru.
10387 : But first, the nummy-wummies! Bring me...%!
10388 : You know where you can findy-wind some? At [the cafeteria/the bakery/the dessert stall/Cafe des Larmes/the fishmonger's stall].
10389 : What tooky-wook you so long!? The pangs are too much to bear... Gimme that!
10390 : Now that I have my energy back...time to get down to food huntaruing...err, clothes changing, again!
10391 : And a little switchy-witch there, puff up a little...
10392 : I supposey-wose this'll have to do.
10393 : Much obliged! Come visit us again, hearrr?
10394 : Word on the streetaru is that we are [like a terrible faux pas./as gaudy as a demon in drag./as flashy as the Mighty Maidens!/as debonair as the Dashing Dreamers!/like disciples of Brygid herself!]
10395 : A faux pas!? We're lucky they don't tary-war and feather us!
10396 : Well, we are flashy, I guess...but about as cute as week-old Moblin undies!
10397 : The only one busty-wusty enough to compare with the Mighty Maidens is you--and that's because you eataru like a pig!
10398 : But boy, I'd let Uka roast me over a spit any day of the week!
10399 : Oy, get your head out of the cloudy-wouds!
10400 : The only dashing that'll happen will be our hopes if the tyrannical manager learns we've been gallivantaruing about town finagling treats from unsuspecting vendors!
10401 : But then...a dancing duo must make more money than simple streetaru performers like us...
10402 : Have you gone totally off your rocker-wocker? We aren't even wearing any subligars!
10403 : Words like that would cause a fashion riotaru in front of Fontis Xanira!
10404 : Stop being such a pessimistaru! The day of our fashion dominance is soon at hand!
10405 : Okay, up next! What shall we slip into our mouths...I mean just slip into next?
10406 : Not only can we not make them cracky-wack so much as a smile, but these getups make us look absolutely ridiculous!
10407 : This is the thanks I get for eataruing your % when you said you were full!?
10408 : And about that %--when I asked where it had gone after I finished practicing my penmanship-wenmanship and you told me you had no idea, you were lying the whole time!?
10409 : Look at the two of you crrretins! You'd better not be running up another tab after all the work we did paying the first one!
10410 : B-but if it's already paid off, then we have every rightaru to start up another one! Quick, Musto-Rusto, before she catches-watches us!
10411 : G-get back here this instant! Get your butts to work right now, or else you'll rrregret it! At least that Galka fool has the sense to do what's asked of him!
10412 : %! Go catch them before they bleed us drrry!
10413 : Your management skill has increased by 0.#!
10414 : ...Probably.
10415 : Not good at all. My cold's getting worse.
10416 : I should have a nice, warm % to help take the edge off. Yes, that sounds perfect.
10417 : Yes? Oh? Is this for me?
10418 : How'd you ever know that I was craving %?
10419 : Ahhh... Yes, that hits the spot!
10420 : Aaall right! I feel ready to take on anything that comes my way!
10421 : You're a real pal! C'mon--a little something for your trouble.
10422 : Oh, for the love of... Stop starrring at our customers, %!
10423 : Though since you're technically one of us now, perhaps I should fill you in. The coalition has become a bit of a hot spot for young loverrrs of all shapes and sizes.
10424 : Ah, young love! Their twinkling eyes filled with the light of hope, and their bulging wallets filled with the sparkle of coin!
10425 : So, don't blow it by scarrring away all the business!
10426 : And besides, what're you doing lollygagging about here when there's worrrk to be done!?
10427 : Don't play coy with me--you know exactly what I mean!
10428 : How do you respond? You wish you had a boyfriend. You mean money! You want me to find Tarutaru Sauce.
10429 : Quite the sharrrp tongue for one who can't even afford an empty wooden crate.
10430 : Let me be purrrfectly clear: it's not me you need to worry about.
10431 : It's those debtors extraordinaire, Tarutaru Sauce!
10432 : So haul tail outta here and find those worthless food vacuums, because rrright now the only thing they're eating is our profits!
10433 : I had you pegged for one apt to use more delicate phrrrasing, but...yes, this is all about money.
10434 : Haul tail outta here and find those worthless food vacuums before they eat us out of house and home!
10435 : So you are, in fact, not oblivious to where you should be headed.
10436 : That leaves me with one question: Did you show that ugly mug of yours arrround here just to taunt me?
10437 : Or is it that you came here to spy on our lovebird clientele in some psychotic need to be known as Adoulin's most prrrolific peeping Tonberry?
10438 : Either way, haul tail outta here and find those worthless food vacuums before they eat us out of house and home!
10439 : Haven't you done enough ogling for one day!? Get out there and make sure Tarutaru Sauce isn't wrrreaking havoc throughout the city!
10440 : Owwwwww... Those fools made me thrrrow my back out!
10441 : The cheap is onto us, Musto-Rusto! Can you believe she actually took time to visit every restaurantaru in Adoulin and have them blacklist us!?
10442 : Oh, my lovely Minnifi...
10443 : Musto-Rusto's cheeks begin to flush at the thought of Minnifi Delqabba.
10444 : I haven't had so much as a nibble-wibble in the past three hours!
10445 : Oh, for but a whiff of your blonde-wonde hair...
10446 : Musto-Rusto! I'm about to keel over from malnourishmentaru, and you just stand there like a Goblin enthralled with rare ore!
10447 : Have you decided to abandon our lifelong dream in the pursuit of a fresh piece of tail!?
10448 : Remember when we set out on this path? We pledged to become the greataruest comedic duo in all Vana'diel and reap all the fruits--and meat and desserts--of our labor!
10449 : Our carnal pleasures lie not in the fleshy-wesh of women, but in the succulence of freshly roasted dhalmel steaks!
10450 : Are you listening!? Are my words even entering-wentering your ears!?
10451 : (Hmm... Wait. If Musto-Rusto lands himself a vegetable-hocker like Minnifi...)
10452 : (...Then we can get her to cook some five-star meal-weals for us!)
10453 : (Yes! This is perfectaru! All it requires is some careful plotting...er, planning on my part.)
10454 : Oi, Musto-Rusto! I've come up with a way to make Minnifi throw herself at your feet before the end of the day!
10455 : Really!? You mean I'll be able to cuddle-wuddle up against her bosoms!?
10456 : Your head'll be snug between 'em faster than Ingrid can make the ministers soil their underclothes!
10457 : Leave the details to me, and your love will be requitarued!
10458 : Hooray!
10459 : Uh-oh, it's...
10460 : Our lovely assistantaru! Perfect! Gimme a hand to make Musto-Rusto's confession of love the most heart-wrenching ever!
10461 : But I'm feeling a little faintaru, so chop-chop.
10462 : There are four ingredientarus to any good confession: the looks, the come-on, the stylistic pose, and...
10463 : The gift! The last one is especially-wecially important!
10464 : It's really-weally that simple! I've thought of a couple ideas for each category, so you can help by weighing in with what seems the most appropriate!
10465 : As our assistantaru, your job is to find the perfect arrangement to make Musto-Rusto the apple of Minnifi's eye.
10466 : Failure-wailure is not an option!
10467 : At least, not with me at the helm, because I'll shootaru you down if your choices are lacking a certain je-ne-sais-croissant.
10468 : First, we'll need to decide on the outfitaru. Minnifi will surely turn her nose away if she doesn't find his exterior appealing--a large task, to be sure.
10469 : What hat will you choose? The %. The %. The %.
10470 : So, you think this'll make a good impression-wession?
10471 : Is this your choice? Yes. No. Start over.
10472 : Now we have to come up with the right come-on. A powerful opening line will make her knees like jelly!
10473 : How should he strike up a conversation? Hey, pretty. Wanna see my Mog Garden? I heard you're an excellent cook. I wanna see you in a subligar!
10474 : Musto-Rusto should uttaru the words, [Hey, pretty. Wanna see my Mog Garden/I heard you are an excellent cook/I want to see you in a subligar]?
10475 : Next, we gotta decide how Musto-Rusto should presentaru himself. You know, how to ham it up!
10476 : What kind of pose should he do? A lively jig. A flourishing welcome. A panic attack!
10477 : Are you absolutaruly sure?
10478 : Finally, the best part--the giftaru! What better way to seduce a woman than giving her something she'll never forget?
10479 : You have to be very-wery careful, because this could make or break everything--and we both need him to win over Minnifi!
10480 : Which gift will you choose? %. %. %. %. %. %.
10481 : You're confident that'll make her like putty in Musto-Rusto's hands?
10482 : Then it's settled-wettled!
10483 : But it wouldn't do to have him go in dry. First, it's rehearsal-wearsal time!
10484 : I'll figure out how to procure the proper attire.
10485 : In the meantime, Musto-Rusto, you'll have to practice-wactice your come-on and beckoning pose!
10486 : And as for you, assistantaru, hurry up and bring me that %.
10487 : Don't you understand-wand the word hurry!? It's been three hours already, and I can't take any more!
10488 : You gotta bring me %, or it'll be curtains-wurtains for Musto-Rusto!
10489 : M-Minnifi! [Hey, pretty. Wanna see my Mog Garden-warden?/I heard you are an excellentaru cook./I want to see you in a subligar-wubligar!]
10490 : Musto-Rusto! The present's all set, so it's time-wime to roll up your sleeves and get down to business!
10491 : And I know just the thing to help you practice-wactice...
10492 : Let's just put this here and... Sweet Altana, it must weigh a thousand-wousand ponzes!
10493 : Ahhh! This is a mistake of momentaruous proportions!
10494 : Let me try that again...
10495 : Move, you stupid fatty-watty!
10496 : <Phew> Okay, I think-wink this is the right one.
10497 : There. A tad bit more attractive-wactive, wouldn't you say?
10498 : Action!
10499 : I don't know if I can do it...the butterflies are bouncing-wouncing around in my stomach...
10500 : Enough talk of stomachs! You've got to lead with your come-on and then strike a daring-waring pose!
10501 : I, uh... Ummm... [Hey, pretty, wanna see my Mog Garden snake...!?/I heard you're excellentaru when cooked...!?/I want to see your subligar hanging on a...!?]
10502 : Now, quickly! Hand over the presentaru, cool as a cucumber!
10503 : Aaaaaand...cut!
10504 : Hmm... No, no, no! This isn't what I envisioned-wisioned at all!
10505 : We're trying to woo Minnifi, not send her screaming for the hills! Back to the drawing board-woard!
10506 : I'll make sure this present gets disposed-wosed of properly.
10507 : What were you thinking, you lame-brained sack of meataru!? This time, pick something that'll actually work!
10508 : Musto-Rusto, back to rehearsal! Love is all about sweataru and tears!
10509 : And you good-for-nothing-wothing fleabag--fetch me the %!
10510 : Hmmm... Yes! This is absolutely perfectaru! Exactly the flair and panache I was hoping for!
10511 : And the way you tripped over your lines was adorable-worable!
10512 : Yes, I can pictaru you hand-in-hand with Minnifi, counting the stars as you sit by Fontis Xanira!
10513 : R-really!?
10514 : Oh-ho-ho, yes, indeed! With me as the big cheese, there's no way she'll let you slip-wip through her grasp! So, get to it!
10515 : G-get to it!?
10516 : Oi! Stop loafing about like this morning's laundry and get her to start cooking...er, get her to notice you!
10517 : Okay, Tuffle-Buffle. I'll be okay. Just breathe-weathe...breathe... <Whew>
10518 : Why, if it isn't Musto-Rusto! To what do I owe the pleasurrre?
10519 : I, uh...
10520 : M-Minnifi, I...
10521 : [My M-Mog Garden, uh.../I h-heard.../I w-wantaru...]
10522 : Minnifi, my sweet. Work keeping you preoccupied?
10523 : Oh, Patrillaut!
10524 : I've got a customer at the moment, but I prrromise I'll be right with you!
10525 : I, uh... M-Minnifi? Who is your acquaintance?
10526 : Why, he's my new boyfrrriend! Tee hee!
10527 : (B-b-b-b-boyfriend!?)
10528 : He's so strrrong, handsome...and tall!
10529 : (T-t-t-t-tall!?)
10530 : Minnifi, dearest, your customer is here to purchase your lovely vegetables, not to hear about your personal affairs.
10531 : Oh my! Where are my mannerrrs?
10532 : Oh, Musto-Rusto, leaving so soon? Be surrre to stop by again sometime!
10533 : Mmph...mmph... Bwahahaha! She shot you down because you're a shorty! Talk about burned to a crisp!
10534 : Well, since we have this gift...and Minnifi won't be consuming it anyway...
10535 : Tuffle-Buffle, you pile of umbril dung! To think I trusted-wusted you when you claimed we could hit it big as performers!
10536 : But every time I turn around you're stuffing your face, and you can't even help me land my dream girl!
10537 : Why, you ungrateful--! Need I remind you of the time when you froze trying to hand over your love lettaru to Tralulu? Who was it that took time out of his busy day to read it in front of the entire class?
10538 : And those misshapen % you were going to give her--who was kind enough to eat them for you?
10539 : So that's why everyone was giggling when I sulked back from the bathroom stalls--!
10540 : Crrretins!!! I knew you'd be running amok and sullying the good name of our coalition!
10541 : M-Musto-Rusto, ruuun! Vana'diel hath no fury-wury like a Mithra scorned!
10542 : S-scorrrned!? Why you--he told me he had to work late last night!
10543 : %, go after those two before I call the Peacekeeperrrs!
10544 : Wh-what!? What on Vana'diel...!
10545 : The nerrrve! They've got a lot of explaining to do!
10546 : <Sigh> What am I supposed to do with this?
10547 : My tummy-wummy aches for sinful succulence! First the cheap has all the fine dining establishmentarus snub us, and then our mannequin gets wrenched from our tender grasp... Are we doomed to forever be denied our meal ticket?
10548 : Meal ticket!? You would abandon all we have worked hard for just because you can't stuff your face?
10549 : She just took the mannequin away for storage!
10550 : I suppose it is a bitaru on the heavy side...
10551 : And you've seen the way her whiskers twitch whenever she gets embarrassed. She certainly wouldn't be caughtaru dead lugging that thing around.
10552 : So that means...it couldn't have gone far!
10553 : That's rightaru! Who are we to let this bounty linger on the line?
10554 : Uh-oh, it's... %!
10555 : Perfect! You're rightaru on time to help us in our most delightful of plans... To rescue our mannequin from its undoubtedly wooden prison!
10556 : Surely-wurely you remember when we used it to help me practice my paean of love to Minnifi Delqabba! Well, maybe use isn't the right word. But it's the one that looks just like the cheap.
10557 : She probably stash-washed it away in some old warehouse around here.
10558 : And, uh, before you do that...
10559 : Tuffle-Buffle! Get rid of those awful-wawful things!
10560 : She couldn't have lugged it much further than this.
10561 : A pity for you two...
10562 : ...That the only buffet you'll find is one of lint and sawdust.
10563 : Celestin here, ready to lead you to heaven with my pearly whites!
10564 : And I, Fabioso, will entice you to the underworld with my sinfully sweet stare!
10565 : Together, we'll whisk you away from your troubles and turn your knees to...
10566 : Wait! Wait! Wait! What's the meaning-weaning of this?
10567 : We, Tarutaru Sauce, have enchanted all of Adoulin with our wonderful antics-wantics and hijinks!
10568 : Dashing Dreamers? Hah! More like Dribbling Dopes!
10569 : Wh-why you little--!
10570 : The only dribbling going on here is your spittle as you stand agape at our masculine prowess!
10571 : And who names their two-gil duo Tarutaru Sauce, anyway? I cannot fathom how short that straw you drew must have been!
10572 : Now, now, Celestin. There's no need to crucify two Tarutaru who're obviously down on their luck.
10573 : Y-you're right, of course. How unbecoming to let them get under my skin.
10574 : About that buffet--I mean, of course, that you won't find your mannequin here.
10575 : It has been relocated to Watergarden Coliseum.
10576 : Dine on that!
10577 : Watergarden Coliseum-weum? Then it's off to Rala Waterways we go!
10578 : Isn't that where Maester Flaviria holds her raptor fightarus?
10579 : To ho ho! The concessions-wessions they peddle inside are to die for! We can watch some fights, fill our bellies, and take back our mannequin!
10580 : And %--as our lovely assistantaru, I demand that you come with us and see that our plans bear fruit!
10581 : The Watergarden Coliseum is where the Mummers' Coalition holds its raptor-waptor fights.
10582 : Hurry along, then!
10583 : The sauce barrel starts rumbling.
10584 : What next? Open the barrel. [Poke the barrel/Tap on the barrel/Pound on the barrel/Growl at the barrel/Growl at the barrel]. Flee the scene.
10585 : Those pretty-wetty boys are so justifiably jealous of our overwhelming popularity that they stuffed us in barrels! But this time, they've bitaru off more than they can chew!
10586 : Next time we'll make them eataru humble pie!
10587 : But before that... My stomach-womach demands recompense!
10588 : %, you must bring me %!
10589 : Get a move on, before I pass out from malnourishmentaru and the Dashing Dreamers claim all we hold dear!
10590 : I'm sure you can find % at the local-wocal confectionery!
10591 : Is that...is that %?
10592 : Stop hammering away like you're softening up a chicken-wicken and get us outta here!
10593 : By all that is holy, my food bettaru not have gone stale! How can we stop the Dribbling Dopes from hogging the spotlight if I'm retching in some back alley!?
10594 : Only one way to find out... <Munch munch>...
10595 : Absolutaruly perfect!
10596 : We're coming for you, Dopes!
10597 : That's rightaru, %! To the Watergarden Coliseum!
10598 : What on Vana'diel!?
10599 : Othellius, whatever are you on about?
10600 : Sweet heavens above! Are the two of you all right?
10601 : I-I'm fine...but it's Tuffle-Buffle! Please, Svenja, you've got to do something-womething!
10602 : Let me take a look.
10603 : Is he...is he gonna make it?
10604 : His illness does not appear to be fatal. However...
10605 : He seems to have suffered some unbearable shock. I cannot say when he will rejoin us.
10606 : You're saying he mightaru be a vegetable forever!?
10607 : He could be hale by the next dawn...or it could be as long as--
10608 : Svenja, I don't care what it takes! You've gotta help-welp bring him back!
10609 : Without him, Tarutaru Sauce will never be able to claim our due!
10610 : I made him a promise.
10611 : I swore to him that we'd be able to eataru like kings once we achieve star status as Vana'diel's most prolific comedic duo.
10612 : I'm gonna fulfill-will that promise...but I can't do it alone!
10613 : Hmmm...
10614 : Aha! Perhaps we can come up with a more unorthodox treatment. One fit for a man who liked nothing more than to see others laugh.
10615 : Mistress Svenja, are you referring to the medicinal plant that sprouts over in Sih Gates?
10616 : None other. Yet I fear that obtaining such a remedy requires a patient hand and more than a couple ponzes of luck.
10617 : One of the Scouts' Coalition's dispatches once offhandedly mentioned a surefire way to spot one in the wilds.
10618 : They react favorably to large sounds of a jovial nature, causing them to spring forth from the soil faster than if you applied the Civic Arboretum's most potent fertilizer.
10619 : So all we need is to find it and feed-weed it to Tuffle-Buffle, right?
10620 : I am loath to offer assurances, but it can prove no less effective than waiting for the illness to take its course.
10621 : Yet our first order of business should be to transport Tuffle-Buffle to the infirmary posthaste.
10622 : I'll carry him there while % searches for the plant.
10623 : You will, won't you, %? It might be the only way to shake Tuffle-Buffle out of his slumber!
10624 : Meanwhile, I won't take my eyes off him for a second!
10625 : Please, %. He needs you.
10626 : The plant responds best to laughter. Remember that should you get stuck.
10627 : The patient has been safely transported to the order's infirmary.
10628 : I must confess to furrowing my brow upon hearing Othellius mention that the plant needed to cure Tuffle-Buffle reacts to laughter.
10629 : I can scarce fathom anything quite so odd.
10630 : %! Tell-well me you didn't come back empty-handed!
10631 : Othellius, please extract the critical ingredients and measure out a proper dosage.
10632 : At once.
10633 : Though I may have used the term dosage, this is not a proper medicine. It is a more tribalistic remedy, with the nutrients found in the % serving to stimulate the nerves.
10634 : In layman's terms, I hope to jolt him back into consciousness.
10635 : It's all ready. We just have to administer--
10636 : I'll do it!
10637 : ... ...Urk... Blech! Ugh! <Cough>
10638 : Hey, Musto-Rusto! You're aiming to keep all our profits to yourself by poisoning-woisoning me, aren't you!?
10639 : Um, well... You see, we were just trying to jolt you...
10640 : We administered a draught containing a small amount of non-lethal toxins from % in an attempt to wake you from your torpor.
10641 : Unpalatable, but necessary.
10642 : You... You gave me a poisoned-woisoned mushroom!
10643 : I knew it! You were trying to send me to sleep-weep with the fishes!
10644 : N-no! It's nothing like that!
10645 : Lies and slander-wander! Wait...just where am I, anyway?
10646 : The infirmary in Western Adoulin.
10647 : An infirmary-wirmary? What am I doing here!?
10648 : We've got no time for such nonsense! Our fans demand that we rehearse our act backstage--and I can't possibly do that when my tummy is rumbling like a storm on Lightningday!
10649 : Rehearse!? The only thing you care about is stuffing your face!
10650 : I suspect everything is back to normal.
10651 : %, while you are here...
10652 : Good pioneer, while you are here...
10653 : Could you please take that dreadful thing with you?
10654 : I am afraid Othellius may have thrown his back out carrying it here.
10655 : We went backstage, but there were no refreshmentarus whatsoever.
10656 : First I slip into unconsciousness, now there's nothing to nibble-wibble on...
10657 : Is that all you can think about!? No Thanks for saving me or I knew I could countaru on you?
10658 : And lestaru you forget, it was your ravenous appetite that got you into this debacle to begin with!
10659 : Why, you ungrateful--! Remember when you broke out into a cold sweataru before your final exam? Just who was it that slipped a % into your tea to calm your nerves?
10660 : Th-that was you the whole time!?
10661 : Halfway through the essay section I passed out, leaving a pool of spittle where there should have been my magnum opus-wopus!
10662 : You morons had better... Hold on. Why aren't you rrrunning?
10663 : M-Musto-Rusto, did you see that? Not only does our mannequin move, she talks-walks!
10664 : Wh-who are you calling a mannequin!? I have half a mind to--
10665 : Ack! It's the real cheap! Run! Run!
10666 : And why are those two still in Adoulin, anyway!?
10667 : (Does that mean that the Dashing Drrreamers failed? Hmmm...)
10668 : (Then they still need a manager to keep their sorry butts out of trrrouble.)
10669 : (<Sigh> Only one thing to do.)
10670 : %, a hearty congratulations are in orrrder! I am promoting you to an official manager, effective immediately.
10671 : Oh no. No need for you to sign anything this time.
10672 : And I quote: The provisions set forth in the preceding article shall apply mutatis mutandis to an Employee promoted to a Managerial Position.
10673 : Meaning, in part, that you are still on full commission.
10674 : Your remuneration shall be paid on a sliding scale based on the purrrformance of your charges.
10675 : So if you don't want to get rrrobbed, I suggest you get out there and work them to the bone!
10676 : Ah, but I've forgotten your official Mummers' Coalition signet. Stop by when you have a moment and I'll get it preparrred.
10677 : But before you do that...
10678 : Trrrack down those two before they eat us out of house and home!
10679 : Your management skill is now #.
10680 : Congratulations! You are now an official manager!
10681 : G-get back here!
10682 : Stop! Stop!!! Stop, I say!!!
10683 : Hang on--we're right back where we startarued!
10684 : Oh, dear! Just when I thought we'd gotten used to the layoutaru, too...
10685 : Yo, Musto-Rusto!
10686 : Remember the conversation we had over a nice cup of cocoa when we first came to Adoulin-Wadoulin?
10687 : All our hopes and dreams...how could I possibly forgetaru it?
10688 : We proclaimed that we were going to be the biggestaru Tarutaru stars Vana'diel has ever seen!
10689 : Even Mumor would acquiesce to our mightaru!
10690 : Just like our dream, we're Tarutaru Supreme!
10691 : At least, that's what it was supposed to be... But when you filled out the form at the Mummers' Coalition, all you could think about was fried fish-wish, so we ended up as Tarutaru Sauce...
10692 : Bwahaha! Don't sweataru the small stuff!
10693 : Even as Tarutaru Sauce, our goals are still within our grasp!
10694 : As long as we've got each other-wother.
10695 : You're rightaru! Together we can lick any problem, big or small!
10696 : And now, Musto-Rusto...
10697 : It's time for... Our greataru escape!
10698 : % uses %.
10699 : Looking for Tarutaru Sauce? Can't say I've seen those two crrretins around lately.
10700 : But isn't that your job? Hmmmmmmmmm?
10701 : I suppose it'd be too much to ask for them to have boarrrded the last ship bound for Windurst.
10702 : <Sigh> You're undoubtedly herrre for your Mummers' Coalition signet, so I'll give you a choice of four.
10703 : Choose wisely, as if you want anotherrr one I'll charge you a handling fee of # bayld.
10704 : But such precious signets take a fair bit of time to fashion, so you may need to wait a tad in between trrransactions.
10705 : Which would you like? I need more time. The %. The %. The %. The %.
10706 : The %? You're absolutely surrre?
10707 : Final answer? Final answer. Do I have any lifelines left?
10708 : Listen carefully. This is a prrrized artifact of the Order of Thurandaut. Losing it could be considered a grievous breach of contract.
10709 : Here for a new signet? Well...you'll need to trrrade the old one to me.
10710 : So? Which signet you in the business for?
10711 : The %, huh? It'll rrrun you # bayld.
10712 : Don't try to bamboozle me! That's not enough bayld!
10713 : Ugh! How could you go about losing your signet!? You're lucky I don't brrring Maester Flaviria out here to give you a tongue-lashing!
10714 : Normally it would spell the end of your dead-on-the-vine careerrr... But I'll let it pass--this time.
10715 : Don't think I'll give it away for a song and a dance. I'll need a fee of # bayld.
10716 : And what do you want? You've gotta wait a little while to exchange your signet.[/ And don't tell me you've lost the old one!]
10717 : What's taking them so longy-wong?
10718 : Well, well, a visitaru! On behalf of the Inventors' Coalition, welcome!
10719 : Our coalition's bestaru minds are always at work to make life in Adoulin more fulfilling and convenient!
10720 : Poignantaruly wonderful, just like our motto!
10721 : Bringing our ingenuity to your frontaru door!
10722 : You betcha! Research and developmentaru are our bread and butter.
10723 : And with the explanation out of the way, let's get down to the self-introduction-wuction. I'm Amchuchu and, well, I keep this place running.
10724 : Wait...%? It's you, yes?
10725 : You have business with the coalition? Oh, that's rightaru--I suppose a pioneer would be in need of our services.
10726 : If my memory-wemory is correct, you came from the Middle Lands.
10727 : Toho! Then you're from the same place as our little-wittle Junior!
10728 : Oh, of course. One of those adventarus from the Middle Lands, right?
10729 : And your name is...%.
10730 : %. Got it!
10731 : So, %, you're from the same place as our little-wittle Junior!
10732 : No? You aren't? Hmm...well, Junior is a researcher, not an adventurer, so I must have my wires crossed...tohoho.
10733 : Now it all falls into place!
10734 : But honestly, if you're from the Middle Lands, then you mustaru have heard of him.
10735 : Who? The talented technologistaru, Cid!
10736 : Junior is his son!
10737 : That's why we gave him the epithetaru Junior!
10738 : His really-weal name is Midras, but doesn't it sound wrong to call him Mid? That's why we decided to use a different, delightfully silly name.
10739 : As long as we're talking about him, Junior and I are researching methods of increasing yields of vegetable-wegetables and other crops.
10740 : We need highly potentaru fertilizer to do this, so I sent him to gather some materials.
10741 : The technical guide he broughtaru from the Middle Lands has sure come in handy! Something about a special rock, or mineral, or what-have-you.
10742 : So I sent him off to the Sih Gates to see whataru he can unearth.
10743 : But he hasn't come backy-wack yet. I wonder what he could be doing...
10744 : Yet I can't just up and leave the coalition. Things would fall apart quicker than one of the Couriers' Coalition's rickety cartarus!
10745 : Oh, hey! If you've got some free time, would you mind making a quicky-wick stop over there and checking up on Junior?
10746 : Go find Junior? I'm up for an adventure. No thanks.
10747 : For real? Wow, you're a lifesaver-waver!
10748 : The Sih Gates are caverns connectarued to the Ceizak Battlegrounds.
10749 : Just, uh...come back safe. Junior has a good head on his shoulders, but the Sih Gates are no place to get careless-wareless.
10750 : Wh-what? You refuse my simple requestaru?
10751 : Hmph, I knew you'd just let me down! Why did I even bother-wother to ask? Let's see how nice I am when you come crawling back!
10752 : I know why you're back! It's to help me with my little-wittle issue!
10753 : I can tell by that look in your eyes. You will head to the Sih Gates and look for Junior, won't you?
10754 : The door is bolted shut.
10755 : You made it back! Well? How is he?
10756 : You hand over the %.
10757 : This is that rocky-wock we were looking for! Fantastic!
10758 : You metaru with Cid, too!?
10759 : ...I see. Well, if that's how things are...
10760 : Junior will stay behind and continue his analysis, I takey-wake it?
10761 : All that's leftaru is for me to analyze the lovely sample you've brought back.
10762 : Oh, goodness! I've completely forgotten to expressy-wess my appreciation!
10763 : Here! For you! I'm sure there'll be much more you can do for me later on, but we'll leave that for another-wother day.
10764 : Why, %! A pleasure-weasure to see you, as always!
10765 : The % you broughtaru me earlier has proven to be quite a blessing! We're still in the middle of our investigations, but so far our resultarus look promising.
10766 : Our next steppy-wep is to find an effective method for extractaruing the nutrients inside.
10767 : What's this now? Junior? That little sweetheartaru is out on another trip.
10768 : You ever heard of Yorcia Weald? It's a land corruptarued by poison, but for some reason all sorts of plants grow there. What a fascinating place to study! Who knows what we could learn?
10769 : That's why I sentaru him out there.
10770 : He's probably fine on his own, but you know how easily he gets into trouble-wouble, tohoho.
10771 : I worry about him sometimes... If you have a spare momentaru, would you mind checking up on him for me?
10772 : You're always so dependable-wendable, %. That's why I like you. Now I can focus on my investigations without any distractions!
10773 : Maybe you've been to the weald before, but just in case, it's locatarued past the Cirdas Caverns, through an opening somewhere near the middle-widdle.
10774 : Keep safe along the way, and make sure that little one isn't in any dire predicamentaru!
10775 : B-but, %... You helped me once before, and now you turn on me in my second hour of need? Oh, this certainly puts a damper-wamper on things.
10776 : You're not a member of my coalition, so I can't force you, but...if you have a spare minute-winute, I'll be right here.
10777 : How lovely to see you again, %! Have you rethoughtaru my offer?
10778 : Do you remember what I asky-wasked? To head to Yorcia Weald and make sure Junior isn't in over his head?
10779 : For the love of--Amchuchu, you're not my mother!
10780 : Well, I never...!
10781 : Oh my, %! Junior was just telling-welling me about what happened.
10782 : You made it back!
10783 : So? What did Aldo have to say?
10784 : He said he'd consider it? Great news! Did you notice anything else while you were there?
10785 : He seemed rather vexed?
10786 : Well, when you've got a product as revolutionary as mine, I suppose I can forgive him for being a bit hesitant.
10787 : At least I'm on the right path. Now, to progress to even greater discoveries!
10788 : I know I can count on you when that time comes.
10789 : Oh, Junior, while I have your attention-wention...
10790 : What's this about me actaruing like your mother!?
10791 : First off, exactly-wactly how old do you think I am!?
10792 : Well, I, uh...
10793 : Um... Oh! That reminds me, Amchuchu, you haven't yet rewarded % for [his/her] efforts!
10794 : You're right! I can't believe I nearly forgotaru!
10795 : It's not much, but I'm sure you can accept that the coalition is currently pouring-wouring all its resources into other avenues.
10796 : Well, now that that's taken care of, I'll be showing myself out...
10797 : Junior! We aren't done! Get back here and tell me just what exactly you meantaru!
10798 : ...And I want those papers-wapers on my desk by the end of the week.
10799 : Consider it done, Maester!
10800 : ...ior.
10801 : ...
10802 : ...Junior?
10803 : Snappy-wap out of it, Junior!
10804 : Wh-who? What?
10805 : Ahhh, Amchuchu...
10806 : Uh... What were we talking about again?
10807 : Altana help me, I expectaru you to be paying attention, not eyes glazed over in stupor!
10808 : S-sorry, Amchuchu. I've just got a lot on my mind.
10809 : I want answers, and I want them fast. Where's that cur of an inventor--or whatever he calls himself--from the Middle Lands?
10810 : Maester Gratzigg--that's him! That's the man!
10811 : I think his name was Midgus? Midas? Midras? Yes, Midras. That's right.
10812 : The name of this spy is of no concern to me.
10813 : Tell me, spy... You recognize this linkpearl, don't you? Don't you!?
10814 : Don't play the fool with me. My man Hektor saw you using it to communicate with someone!
10815 : <Gulp>
10816 : (If the Peacekeepers' Coalition saw me using it, then...!)
10817 : (Then what about the report?)
10818 : (If they found the report...)
10819 : (If they found the report, it'll spell the end for me and all the work I've done!)
10820 : Speak up, fool! If you don't spit out the name of who you were talking to, I'll have your head on a pike in front of Platea Triumphus!
10821 : Stop stalling, pond scum! Out with it!
10822 : (No mention of the report?)
10823 : (Does that mean they...haven't found it?)
10824 : Hmph. Your silence speaks volumes.
10825 : Maybe your tongue will loosen a bit once you're formally charged. Bring him back to the coalition.
10826 : (I guess they haven't seen it! Then...there's no solid evidence for them to go on.)
10827 : (But that still doesn't solve the mystery of where it went off to.)
10828 : Got cotton stuffed in your ears, boy? You'll be coming with us!
10829 : We wouldn't have incidents like this if you shut your doors to these meddling foreigners.
10830 : Excuse me, Gratzigg, but nothing my coalition has done has imposed-wosed any hardship on you and yours.
10831 : And we both know that fostering technological exchange with other lands is beneficial for the continuing developmentaru of Adoulin.
10832 : Your words are pretty, Amchuchu, but can you really call it exchange when there's espionage going on right under your nose?
10833 : Speaking of noses, I wouldn't be so quick to pokey-woke that honker of yours where it doesn't belong!
10834 : Maybe if these hooligans knew their place, I wouldn't have to! The source of this trouble is their shady actions, not the justified execution of my charge!
10835 : And you pro-colonization nitwits are whining about development, development, development so much that the founder king must be spinning in his grave.
10836 : The only reason you're able to waste all your energy spewing-wewing such filth is because the vegetables from the Civic Arboretum--grown with my coalition's technology, I might add--feed that pork barrel you call a stomach!
10837 : What we are working on now will increase the yield tenfold, so that you and your ungrateful comrades can enjoy an even more bountiful harvestaru.
10838 : You think too highly of yourself. Those % grown in that dank pit aren't fit for consumption.
10839 : If it isn't my two favorite maesters. Having a lovely heart-to-heart, are we?
10840 : The two of you are screeching so loud that Ygnas himself could hear it.
10841 : And the topic du jour is vegetables, is it?
10842 : My dear Gratzigg, I'm afraid I must side with the inventors on this one. Those % are as exquisite as any gift from the Goddess.
10843 : I've no time for nonsense, Flaviria.
10844 : I'm here because someone spied a certain inventor from the Middle Lands skulking about the woods, having a hushed conversation through this linkpearl.
10845 : We're here today to ask this boy a few questions, nothing more.
10846 : And just who spotted him?
10847 : My patrolman Hektor. Why?
10848 : Oh-ho. One of your patrolmen. Now where have I seen this tale play out before?
10849 : Oh, yes. I seem to recall an incident where one of your patrolmen had a hand in framing one of my raptors.
10850 : What are you implying?
10851 : Why, nothing.
10852 : And besides, it's not like the conversation is stored inside that thing--although it would be nice if such a device existed.
10853 : But a broken linkpearl? No, that's about as worthless as evidence gets.
10854 : As a man of the law, surely you understand better than any of us that you cannot take this man in for questioning without evidence.
10855 : Isn't that right, esteemed maester?
10856 : <Grumble> If you spent half as much time working as you do flapping your lips...
10857 : Fine. But don't think this is over!
10858 : <Mutter> Stupid, dumb...
10859 : You listen well, boy! Maester Flaviria may have earned you a reprieve, but if you make so much as one wrong move, I'll be on you quicker than Maester Lhe on her subordinates!
10860 : Thank you, Flaviria.
10861 : Think nothing of it. You know how that man can be.
10862 : Oh! %! What a surprise-wise to see you here.
10863 : So? What brings you to the coalition?
10864 : Amchuchu, I've gotta confess something to you!
10865 : Junior? Why so loud--and...are you shivering?
10866 : Well, I...
10867 : I came here to Adoulin at the behest of an organization from the Middle Lands to collect information about your technology.
10868 : I wish I could say more, but...I can't.
10869 : B-but even though I formulated my report, I haven't yet handed it over!
10870 : I understand that no mere words can rectify my massive betrayal of your trust, but...I'm incredibly sorry.
10871 : I see...
10872 : But if you didn't hand over the reportaru, then there's nothing to worry about. Gratzigg had nothing actionable on you.
10873 : I suppose there are always things that must be done away from the lightaru of day.
10874 : I think I understand what's going on. I'm a genius-wenius, after all!
10875 : I know I'm not so naive as to believe that at least some information will not fall into the wrong hands, what with all these pioneers immigrating from the Middle Lands.
10876 : And the coalitions here in Adoulin are never of one mind when it comes to building up our city. How can we blame others when our internal affairs are in such sordid disarray?
10877 : I wish I could counter-wounter your argument, but...you have me bested.
10878 : Oh, Amchuchu, keep your chin up. I'm not singling you out, for the Mummers' Coalition fares no better.
10879 : We employ talent from the Middle Lands just as you do--though they are less...scientifically inclined.
10880 : And they, too, have come with a host of unforeseen problems.
10881 : But we shall save that for another time. There are pressing matters to which I must attend. Adieu, Amchuchu, %.
10882 : Well, then.
10883 : I can't let this getaru me down, lest Chero-Machero scold me for being a misbegotten wastrel. Back to our research!
10884 : Junior-wunior, open your ears! Research calls!
10885 : Ah, Amchuchu, I...
10886 : ...I'm really sorry.
10887 : Poor kid.
10888 : This entire situation has me positively frazzled-wazzled.
10889 : %, you've got a good head-wead on those strong shoulders of yours. What do you think needs to happen?
10890 : What needs to happen? Get angry. Cheer up. Dodge the issue.
10891 : And who should do this?
10892 : Who should do this? Amchuchu. Gratzigg. Cid.
10893 : Hmm... I don't think Junior would feel better if I flipped-wipped my lid.
10894 : And to be honestaru, I don't have a lid to flip!
10895 : Hmm... I could give it my best shot. He sure does need a friend-wend right now.
10896 : I'm not sure if I'm the right-wight person for that, though.
10897 : Hmm... I wasn't evading-wading the question earlier, but you saw that kicked puppy look on his face.
10898 : If my skirtaruing around the issue didn't help then, I don't think it'd be much use now.
10899 : D-did you drop your brain over in Ra'Kaznar!? With all the steam coming out of that lunkhead's ears we could make sweetaru tea for weeks!
10900 : And how could telling him everything possibly-wossibly help the situation!?
10901 : Gratzigg!? The scowl on his face would just send Midras scampering-wampering back to the Middle Lands.
10902 : And that would mean we need to tell him everything. I'd rather play catch-the-Naakual with Peppe-Aleppe out in that forsaken tundra.
10903 : Huh!? The only thing Gratzigg is good at evading is a hotaru bath.
10904 : And if we told him the truth, the only one dodging-wodging anything would be Junior!
10905 : Hmm... Cid certainly would be furious-wurious if he found out what Junior was up to.
10906 : And a pampered fledgling like him would lie huddled-wuddled in a corner for weeks if that happened!
10907 : I'm sure Daddy could make Midras feel like a million gil, but...
10908 : ...Don't you think Cid would positively throw his hammer at the wall when he heard, causing his men no end of consternation?
10909 : Hmm... Cid can't really pussyfootaru around something he doesn't know.
10910 : And when we tell him, well...at least Adoulin is really-weally far away from Bastok.
10911 : Hang on. Nothing actually happened, though. Midras's plan failed-wailed. So there shouldn't be much of an issue.
10912 : That's the ticketaru! If Cid tells Junior there's nothing to worry about, then Junior's future is as bright as the high noon sun on the Coronal Esplanade!
10913 : Okay! Let me find my quill and parchment and pen an epistle.
10914 : It wouldn't do for me to go in person, so I hereby appointaru you as my official envoy!
10915 : Let's see...Cid would take affrontaru if I scrawled any old chicken scratch down, so I must choose my words carefully.
10916 : In the meantime, would you mind running a small errand for me?
10917 : Before this whole debacle broke out, I was in the midstaru of repairing some tools of the trade that a couple of my less dexterous assistants got their mitts on.
10918 : I would ask that you pick up a few things for me so I can restore them to tip-top shape.
10919 : Let me think. %, %...
10920 : ...And %. Yes, one of each should be sufficientaru.
10921 : When you have procured the requisitaru goods, bring them to Chanteillie over there.
10922 : While you're doing that, I'll get started on this letter-wetter right away!
10923 : I'm sure it'll be done by the time you come-wome back!
10924 : You must procure the requisite materials first, else Amchuchu will not be able to help you.
10925 : Ah, %. Amchuchu informed me that you would be assisting in her repair efforts. She requires %, %...
10926 : ...And %. One of each, no more and no less.
10927 : Kindly trade them to me when you return.
10928 : Ah, most excellent. This should suffice.
10929 : I shall see that they are delivered to the appropriate personnel.
10930 : I know our maester asserted that she would have the letter done by the time you returned, but she has a slight penchant for hyperbole. I apologize for the delay, but I must request that you wait a little longer.
10931 : Amchuchu has likely finished composing her missive. A slight knock on the door should get her attention.
10932 : A frenzied scribbling noise emanates from beneath the door.
10933 : Welcome back, %! I hope you haven't waitarued too long.
10934 : Here you are! Make sure it doesn't get crumpled-wumpled on your way to Bastok!
10935 : Back to work for me!
10936 : Oh ho! What a pleasure-weasure to see you again, %.
10937 : Tell me--how did Cid take the news-wews?
10938 : You're kidding me!
10939 : Cid was boiling over like a potaru of stew left to sit on the stove!?
10940 : He said what!?
10941 : Expelled!? You mean Cid actually expelled Junior!?
10942 : E-e-expelled!?
10943 : Junior! You overheard!?
10944 : Just when we thoughtaru things couldn't get any worse...
10945 : But...why? If he got mad before reading my lettaru, then someone else must have told him first.
10946 : Yes, that's the only logical-wogical explanation.
10947 : This is quite a conundrum-wundrum....but I think I'm out of cards to play.
10948 : Maybe we had best let things simmer down while those two collectaru their thoughts.
10949 : Ah, %! I almost forgot!
10950 : Those materials you brought back for me sure did the trick, and you did me the favor of delivering-wivering the letter to Cid, so...
10951 : Here you go!
10952 : I think we should probably-wobably stay out of this for the time being.
10953 : But I didn't become head of this coalition because I was slow on my feetaru! So I'll be sure to brew up a remedy soon.
10954 : When the time comes, I trustaru that you'll be willing to come to Junior's aid again.
10955 : Oh, %, it's you. I was just wondering what to do about that silly-willy Junior of ours.
10956 : He does his work here at the coalition, but he just hasn't been the same since that whole terrible-werrible affair with his father.
10957 : He grimaces all the time, like he's faking whatever enthusiasm he has left. He's like a flataru % that's been left out all day. No fizz. No pizazz.
10958 : Lately I've been seeing him out by the docks, staring-waring out at the ocean.
10959 : Now, ever since that business with those stubborn-wubborn Peacekeepers, I've also been thinking...
10960 : We might not be able to convince Cid to forgive-wive his son so easily, but there is something we can do.
10961 : Finding out what made our boy want to become an inventor to begin with might help us bring the old Junior back-wack.
10962 : If Junior can remember the thing he loves the mostaru about engineering, he might be able to climb out of the dumps and be his old fizzy self again!
10963 : And that's where you come in!
10964 : I want you to go to Bastok and find out what made the old Junior tick. Find out what inspired-wired him!
10965 : The future-wuture of high-density vegetable cultivation is at stake here, %! Don't mess this up!
10966 : I want you to go to Bastok and find out what made the old Junior tick. Find out what inspired-wired him!
10967 : What do you say? Hey, Midras! Hey, Junior!
10968 : Oh, it's you, %.
10969 : Did Amchuchu tell you to look for me here?
10970 : Yup, being by the ocean always helps me clear my head.
10971 : You know, the ocean's a funny sort of thing.
10972 : It's at once teeming with life, offers us a bounty of food and warmth from its currents...
10973 : ...And at the same time, it can be dark and violent and betray all those who would dare trespass against it.
10974 : On my journey to Adoulin, no matter how low or dejected I became...
10975 : ...Looking out to the wide ocean would calm my thoughts. The sea was always there for me, and didn't care what anyone thought or said.
10976 : Kind of like a parent, I guess. Well, now that I'm an orphan again, I'll probably be spending a lot more time out here.
10977 : Ah, sorry. I didn't mean to get you down. What is it that you wanted?
10978 : Ah... The best explosive powder for Palborough Mines?
10979 : Sure, I can help. I don't know what you'd use it for, but I know exactly what you need to get through the bedrock down there.
10980 : But in return, do you think you could get me %?
10981 : Looks like my line's snapped clean. I'm going to need better tackle if I want to keep fish on the menu tonight.
10982 : I'll get your powder ready in the meantime.
10983 : A fishing rod with a broken line has been left here.
10984 : Midras asked you to bring him %.
10985 : Oh, %. You need some more powder?
10986 : I'll tell you what, bring me another % and the powder's all yours.
10987 : These fish really love eating my hooks...or maybe it's just not my day.
10988 : Great, this is just what I needed. And here's the blend of blast powder you wanted, as promised.
10989 : Do you remember what I prepared back at Sih Gates? This stuff is basically the same. The blast itself stays small while the chemical reaction it produces means you can clear out obstacles with surgical precision.
10990 : Here you go. Let me know if you need more.
10991 : You still here? I thought you already left for Palborough Mines.
10992 : % caught %!
10993 : <Sigh> Ah, %, how did it go?
10994 : What!? Is... Is that why you asked me for blast powder!? Why would you...
10995 : You mean...this is... This is my father's? My real father?
10996 : A small piece of paper is folded inside the %.
10997 : To Midras, my precious son. I hope you can one day forgive the man who left you without a father and vanished like I did.
10998 : Having you in his life has taught this selfish wreck of a man so much about the world and so much about himself. That there are things in this life that can't be mended even with all the tools and technology conceivable by human genius.
10999 : Yet, you made me realize that even in a world where nothing is in our control, we can still live for those we love.
11000 : Thank you, Midras, for coming into my life. I only wish I could see you again one last t--
11001 : The letter is torn beyond this point.
11002 : ...
11003 : Hey, %...
11004 : I just realized...I'm a pretty lucky guy, aren't I?
11005 : I mean...just think. I've got two fathers I can live up to now.
11006 : Which father should he live up to? Cid. Almid. Amchuchu.
11007 : If you say you saw it down in the mine...then I believe you.
11008 : The two of them must have been in anguish ever since the day of the explosion. Thanks to you, they can find peace.
11009 : What? All thanks to my explosives?
11010 : No, I don't think you could say that. I never intended to do what you did down there. This is all thanks to you, %.
11011 : To think that all this time the accident was caused by a chain explosion from a bomb monster lurking in the tunnel. Cid's powder mixture had nothing to do with it!
11012 : Still, knowing it was a monster attack won't bring back all the lives lost that day.
11013 : That's what Cid always said. There's no point in grieving over the things you can't control, you just keep on living the best you can to improve on the things that you can.
11014 : Work on what you can, improve what you can, knowing that others' lives depend on it.
11015 : I think I'm ready to take on that responsibility.
11016 : Others might be too scared to accept that burden, but if I don't take it up, how can I ever hope to surpass the old man?
11017 : They said my mother died in the Crystal War soon after giving birth to me.
11018 : And my father, well, I only have a few memories of him before he disappeared.
11019 : But there is one thing I do know.
11020 : That those two gave me everything I've got!
11021 : Like my father, I have to follow my own path, develop my skills, and live for those I love!
11022 : Still... Just think. He had the recipe for the powder mixture I've worked on for so long in his hand long before I even started!
11023 : Goddamn it! Even in death the old man beat me to it! I'm going to have to work hard to catch up if I want to surpass him one day.
11024 : Make way for the next generation!
11025 : I don't think he'd have it any other way.
11026 : Midras : Amchuchu? Haha, somehow I don't think she'd qualify.
11027 : Well...she's certainly a brilliant inventor.
11028 : And there's still so many things she can do that I can't even figure out.
11029 : But I wouldn't call her a father. I guess she's more of a mother, if anything.
11030 : Hey! Just what do you mean to say-way, Junior?
11031 : How old-wold do you think I am!? I...I could be your sister, you know?
11032 : Whoa! Amchuchu, how long were you standing there!?
11033 : Just, uh...forget I said that, okay?
11034 : By the way, I actually have an idea for an admixture I've been meaning to run by you. If we head back to the lab right away I can show you what I mean!
11035 : That's right! %, I've been meaning to give you something. Come by the coalition later.
11036 : And...thanks, %. I mean it!
11037 : Looks like your efforts paid off, %. It's been a while since I've seen Junior that excited aboutaru something.
11038 : I'm sure that grumpy-wumpy Cid will eventually come around as well. If not...
11039 : I'll have to use a little-wittle of my mad science on him!
11040 : Amchuchu has it all under-wunder control!
11041 : Hurry it up, Mom! This one might be it!
11042 : What did you call me!? That was on purpose-wurpose, wasn't it!?
11043 : Keep that up and I might just start my mad science experimentarus on you, Junior!
11044 : Head to the Inventors' Coalition to see Midras.
11045 : Hmmm, but won't this require a longer growing period than with my original idea?
11046 : It will, but the harvest yield will be all the greater for it. Trust me, overall productivity will increase!
11047 : Ah! %, you finally made it!
11048 : I meant to give you this.
11049 : Think of it as a...token of friendship or something. Take good care of it!
11050 : My old man gave me that when I left for Adoulin.
11051 : I made some special modifications of my own. This is the new and improved version!
11052 : Wearing it really clears your head and sharpens your concentration. It's really helped me during my synthesis work.
11053 : What's with that face? Yeah, okay, I know it's not the most fashionable piece of headwear, but that's not the point!
11054 : Would you rather get a crate of %?
11055 : Look, just shut up and take it! Here, catch!
11056 : Whaaat? You lost the %? What did you do?
11057 : Well... If you really miss it, I can give you my spare for # bayld. Those were some rare custom parts, after all.
11058 : Pay # bayld for the spare? Sure. Wait, never mind.
11059 : Here you go. And don't lose it this time!
11060 : Ah... Sorry, %, looks like you're a little short on bayld. If the parts that go into these weren't so expensive, I'd happily give it to you for free.
11061 : No... No you didn't! You lost that % already!?
11062 : Sorry, %. I'm still in the process of putting together a new one. Give me some time until it's finished.
11063 : My tum-tum is bursting for some num-nums. Oh, Musto-Rusto, our days as performers are over...
11064 : And we were the hottaruest comedic duo ever to hit Adoulin...and now we are left with nothing but pangs of hunger.
11065 : I even see hallucinations-wations of % dancing before my very eyes...
11066 : Musto-Rusto, look--%!
11067 : Oh, no...it's just %.
11068 : Enough groveling-woveling for food. Tell [him/her] the news!
11069 : Hm? I coulda sworn we did this already...
11070 : Listen up, %! Tarutaru Sauce is no more! Finito!
11071 : And that's not all.
11072 : Tuffle-Buffle, there's no time for you to keep flapping your tongue. We've got to go!
11073 : B-but what am I to do about this horrible famine? Where are my %...?
11074 : Get your mind out of the feedbag and let's get going!
11075 : Tarutaru Sauce absconds to some unknown location.
11076 : Should you be unaware, this locale is reserved for performances by the various troupes and revues of the Mummers' Coalition. [The next show will not be for a while./You are in luck! The next show is about to begin.]
11077 : Um...before the performance-wormance starts, we've got some most distressing news for you, our adoring fans.
11078 : A-ahem...
11079 : I know this will come as a shock-wock, but Tarutaru Sauce is no more.
11080 : Oh no! That'sh awful!
11081 : Please, say it isn't so!
11082 : <Gasp>!
11083 : But don't fret.
11084 : We are welcoming a new member into the fold, and our duo will now be a trio!
11085 : Enjoy 30% more laughs at just 110% of the entrance fee for the new, improved... Tarutaru Sauce Supreme!
11086 : But you've heard enough chattaru. Now, for the big introduction!
11087 : Of course you all know me--the fearless leader... Tuffle-Buffle!
11088 : And who can forget the maestro of mustard... Musto-Rusto!
11089 : And now, the man you've all been waiting for--the illustrious, magnificentaru... Sangy!
11090 : H-hey! Who died and made you leader!?
11091 : And you there, in the audience--you're going to letaru him get away with that farce of a title!?
11092 : All right, everyone! You know how it goes.
11093 : Live from Adoulin...
11094 : ...it's...
11095 : ...Fireshday...
11096 : ...Night!!!
11097 : !!!
11098 : Ah, but before I forgetaru--there's another announcement we have to make!
11099 : We have special parting gifts for you, our loyal fans. Pupadi Dollmohr, show them what they'll win!
11100 : Oooh, %!
11101 : The princess shared shome with me a couple monthsh ago! They're sho juicy and yummy!
11102 : And plump and rrripe! If I stock them in my stall, profits'll soar for sure!
11103 : T-t-t-tomatoes!?
11104 : All this time I was about to expire from malnourishmentaru, and you were hiding succulence from me!? I can't wait until after the performance--let's chow down now!!!
11105 : Don't even think about it! Those are for our guests-wests!
11106 : What are those two bumbling fools up to, making me hold a basket of tomatoes like a field hand!?
11107 : <Sigh> But the books don't lie. Against all rrrhyme and reason, they've become the coalition's most sought-after act.
11108 : And now there are three of them. What is this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach?
11109 : %, I didn't think you had it in you, but you're not nearrrly as terrible of a manager as I once feared.
11110 : (And now I'm starting to regret making [him/her] sign that contract tying [his/her] pay into their success...)
11111 : (Hey, Fabioso...)
11112 : (Now what, Celestin?)
11113 : (Is it just me, or is almost no one gazing upon our beautiful physiques?)
11114 : (Indeed. I might as well not have put this alluring cologne on this morning.)
11115 : Hey!!!
11116 : Get back here!!!
11117 : I'd hate to say we're losing the audience, but have we lost our way? Should we bring in someone new or hold a joint performance with another group?
11118 : And, well...after that incident a few years ago, the Mighty Maidens certainly won't be chomping at the bit to work with us.
11119 : Ah, Mumor and Uka...
11120 : There is only one female idol left I can think of... My Sweet Mama.
11121 : And once again, you've taken total leave of your senses! My Big Mama is the greatest star this side of Mindartia!
11122 : I thought we'd long since settled this most obvious of disputes!
11123 : Stop wasting your time tearrring into each other and get to dancing, or singing, or...whatever those two left feet and croaking vocal cords of yours can do!
11124 : !!!
11125 : S-sweet heavens! It's the Cheap!!!
11126 : Ch-cheap!? Not you, too!!!
11127 : Mama!!! Mamaaaaaaaaa!!!
11128 : W-we'll remember this, Cheap! Big Mama will come back and whoop your behind!
11129 : <Sigh> When will those two stop hiding under their mommies' skirrrts?
11130 : And as one act falters, another rrrises to take its place. At least Tarutaru Sauce is able to pay their restaurant bills now.
11131 : Ah, and in case you're wondering, the idea to give out % was Yg...Sangy's.
11132 : Tomatoes, potatoes...it's all the same to me as long as the audience eats it up.
11133 : Well, %, you know what you've got to do--make sure that the budget doesn't go as red as those tomatoes. Now, hop to it!
11134 : Why, if it isn't my good friend, %! How have you been?
11135 : Remember a while back, when we were talking about a man in black frequenting the Mummers' Coalition?
11136 : If I recall, his name was Teodor.
11137 : Not too long ago I heard a bit of a rumor about the two of you.
11138 : People are wondering whether you really beat him in a game of Boom or Bust.
11139 : People are wondering whether that man really chickened out on a game of Boom or Bust against you.
11140 : So, is it true?
11141 : I knew it!
11142 : Heh heh... Although, I have to admit that it doesn't surprise me.
11143 : I've been a big fan of yours ever since first hearing of your exploits.
11144 : What's more than a touch odd is that nobody's seen that man around here for a while now.
11145 : Would you happen to know anything about that?
11146 : You know what? Forget I mentioned it.
11147 : Perhaps he managed to shake his gambling addiction? Or maybe there was some other reason.
11148 : Since you can't find him, I suppose you won't be able to challenge him to another match.
11149 : Which reminds me--there's been something I've been meaning to ask you.
11150 : Recently, somebody known as the Viridian Aristocrat has been hanging around the Mummers' Coalition. Have you ever heard of him?
11151 : I thought you, of all people, %, would know him, but I guess there are some things that escape even your watchful eye.
11152 : First a man in black, now a man in green... It's enough to make you wonder which color's next.
11153 : I'm pretty curious about this guy, since I hear so many people are heading to the Mummers' Coalition just to get a glimpse of him.
11154 : You know what? As soon as my break starts, I'm going to check out the Mummers' Coalition.
11155 : It's no big deal, really. I'm actually way ahead on my duties. Maybe I'll challenge this guy if I see him...
11156 : If I can beat him, people just might start calling me the Golden Pioneer!
11157 : Heh heh heh... I can already feel my heart racing!
11158 : That guy'll never know what hit him!
11159 : I'm heading over to the Mummers' Coalition as soon as I'm on my break.
11160 : It is turn number # for [Levil/Sangy].
11161 : [Levil/Sangy] decides to [shoot/stay].
11162 : (Oh no!)
11163 : (I have no choice but to use the Switcheroo to exchange my 6 for his roll...)
11164 : Levil used the old switcheroo! Levil's # will be exchanged with Sangy's #.
11165 : (Huh!? My 6 was exchanged for another 6! I'm right back where I started!)
11166 : (...)
11167 : (C'mon... I need him to bust!)
11168 : Sangy's total: #[/(bust)] Levil's total: #[/(bust)] [Levil wins./Levil loses./It's a draw.]
11169 : (Looks like it just wasn't my day...)
11170 : Levil's record is now # wins, # losses, and # draws.
11171 : Blast... I've still got a chance though. My reputation's riding on this!
11172 : (Alright! If I just stay here... No! No guts, no glory!)
11173 : (Th-there it is! I did it!)
11174 : (Now to win three in a row and start building my legacy!)
11175 : Sangy used the old switcheroo! Sangy's # will be exchanged with Levil's #.
11176 : Huh!?
11177 : I never expected my legacy to consist of three losses in a row...
11178 : Hey! Th-that's a copy of %!
11179 : That's not fair! You can't use that!
11180 : Although, I see why they call you the Viridian Aristocrat. You're an excellent opponent!
11181 : Now, if you wouldn't mind... Do you think I could borrow that book for a while?
11182 : I should've known you'd say no...
11183 : Oh, %! Listen to this!
11184 : The Viridian Aristocrat is actually Sangy!
11185 : What's more, he's a lot tougher than you'd expect from some comedian. He wiped the floor with me!
11186 : This means that it's all riding on you now!
11187 : I beg of you! Please avenge my loss at Boom or Bust!
11188 : What will you do? Leave it to me! Forget it. What's Boom or Bust?
11189 : I understand. Let me know if you ever change your mind, though.
11190 : Sangy, I hope to face you again someday too.
11191 : Hey, %! I gave it another shot, but I lost again.
11192 : Alright! You need three victories to win the match. We've got everything on the line, so don't let me down!
11193 : Remember! You beat the man in black. So don't waste any time and pound out these three victories!
11194 : Remember! The man in black was scared to face you. So don't waste any time and pound out these three victories!
11195 : You snuck a peek at one of your opponent's dice! Sangy's shot number # was a #.
11196 : You used the old switcheroo! Your # has been exchanged with Sangy's #, and your total is now #.
11197 : Choose [Sangy's/your] die and [peek at it/exchange it/make him shoot again].
11198 : Sangy's total: #[/(bust)] Your total: #[/(bust)] [You win!/You lose./It's a draw.]
11199 : Hey, we're just getting started. How can you quit when we're so close?
11200 : Well, I suppose you've got your own life to live. We can always work on building our legacy later!
11201 : Ungh...I have no idea how this one's gonna play out.
11202 : One can never let down their guard.
11203 : I think this is a time to shoot. Or maybe you should stay...
11204 : Hah! I don't know why, but I think I'm more nervous than you are.
11205 : Come on now! You can be the best, like no one ever was!
11206 : I know that Lady Luck is smiling down upon you!
11207 : Come on, %! You can do it!
11208 : Stay focused now...
11209 : If you can just keep this up for a bit longer...
11210 : Okay, what's your next move?
11211 : Th-the room is starting to spin.
11212 : Like they say: know your enemy, and know yourself!
11213 : We did it!
11214 : Victory is ours!
11215 : Uh-oh! Things're starting to heat up!
11216 : H-he countered us!
11217 : Sangy used the old switcheroo! Sangy's # has been exchanged with your #, and your total is now #.
11218 : Sangy used Crooked Die to make you shoot again! Your shot for turn number # is now #, and your total is #.
11219 : The record for % is # win[/s], # loss[/es], and # draw[/s].
11220 : You failed to win three in a row... But it's not over yet! You can still do this!
11221 : Oh no! He's gaining on us! Lady Luck, don't fail us now!
11222 : Okay, we just need to keep this up for two more wins!
11223 : It's okay, we're still in this thing!
11224 : We can't afford to lose another...so let's win two in a row instead!
11225 : Alright! We're almost there!
11226 : We've still got the advantage! Just one more win and the match is ours!
11227 : Okay, it's all or nothing. Don't let us down, %!
11228 : It's a draw. [Don't worry, we'll get the next one!/Sangy's looking a bit pale.../This is one heckuva match!] Bring us home, %!
11229 : W-we lost... The Viridian Aristocrat is simply too tough...
11230 : %, we can't go out like this! I demand a rematch!
11231 : If this keeps up, it's going to be a tough one.
11232 : I wonder where we can get our hands on a strategy guide like the %...
11233 : Okay, %. Don't let me down this time!
11234 : Sangy glances at the %.
11235 : Nice work, %! I always knew you could do it!
11236 : Our legacy is only going to grow from here on out.
11237 : I heard there was somebody here going by the name of the Virrridian Aristocrat?
11238 : Heh heh... He just met with defeat at the hands of the Golden Pioneer and his pal.
11239 : L-Leathery Lhe!
11240 : L-Leathery what!?
11241 : U-uh-oh...
11242 : Why you...!
11243 : Oh, would you look at the time? I need to get back to work before my break's over!
11244 : Rrrushing back to work even though you have ten minutes left on your break? How unexpectedly dedicated of you.
11245 : W-well, I like to take my job seriously...
11246 : Then you won't mind if I cut your break by ten minutes starting tomorrow.
11247 : Wh-what!?
11248 : Or perhaps you'd prefer it if your break were a bit more...permanent?
11249 : Y-you're going to fire me?
11250 : L-l-look at the time! I've only got nine minutes left on my break!
11251 : Y-you know what they say about someone who shirks his duties!
11252 : I'm so envious. The Pioneers' Coalition is always filled with such hard workers.
11253 : What are you talking about? The Mummerrrs' Coalition is making money hand over fist thanks to the Viridian Aristocrat.
11254 : I've never been one to brag about my own good fortune.
11255 : Remember how the Twelve Orders had the whole spat about pro- and anti-pioneering factions, and then there was that mysterious illness plaguing the city?
11256 : And how the entire city was brought nearly to a standstill because of our internal strife?
11257 : That's why I'm more than happy to welcome them to enjoy themselves.
11258 : Besides, the increase in sales will enable me to contribute even more money towards the effort to repair the Rala Waterways.
11259 : That may be so, but...
11260 : Then what's the problem?
11261 : Fine. Whatever you say.
11262 : Although, is Yg...err, I mean the Virrridian Aristocrat really thinking that far ahead?
11263 : I'm not sure. Not that I really care, as long as everybody's happy.
11264 : You neverrr change, do you?
11265 : And you, %... I see you're still poking your nose around wherrrever it suits you.
11266 : Although you actually managed to help out this time around. So perhaps I shouldn't begrrrudge you so much.
11267 : Hey, don't forget about the Mummers, either!
11268 : The Viridian Aristocrat... He's one tough customer.
11269 : Let's head over to the Mummers' Coalition as soon as my break starts!
11270 : B cut short, that reduces the amount of time I can spend at the Mummers' Coalition...
11271 : Now that I think about it, %, can you really afford to be wasting time like this?
11272 : Select([SHOOT/STAY](%))
11273 : Bluff([OFF/ON](Random([0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9])))
11274 : Ah, Logan. The pick you requested is ready--and I must say, a sturdier instrument you will never find.
11275 : Excellent! The coalition was short of precious metals, but no more!
11276 : Of course, I needn't tell you that the other project the coalition is involved in--living together with nature--is starting to really take hold.
11277 : The uncouth in the city who would constantly torment the leafkin have started to come to their senses.
11278 : How lovely! I'm sure Borghest is pleased to see his efforts come to fruition.
11279 : Why, %! Working hard, or hardly working?
11280 : If you're looking for Junior-Wunior, he stepped out for a break not ten minutes ago.
11281 : And that incidentaru with Cid has been completely cleared up, so Midras is able to work without fear of retribution.
11282 : Our research into vegetable cultivation continued unhindered-windered, and the only thing left is to make them more appetizing.
11283 : And whenever that kid gets an idea into his head...well, there's no stopping him.
11284 : Hm? You're looking for Ygnas-Wygnas?
11285 : You just missed him! He had been looking for Junior, too.
11286 : If I don't miss my guess, if you find one, you'll find the other-wother.
11287 : Ygnas has gone after Midras. Look for the budding adventurer and you should find the elusive leafkin.
11288 : Oh! Hey, it's a [/Ultra /Hyper /Psycho /Eternal /Neo /Lovely /Pretty /Final /Extra /Deadly /Savage /Aero /Pseudo /Universal /Exciting /Celestial /Super /Mighty /Mega /Omni /Poly ][/Terror /Perfect /Royale /Gorgeous /Pretty /Hell /Fantasy /Stealth /Powerful /Invincible /Explosive /Storm /Fantastic /Duper /Go-Go /Morphing /Retro /Sonic /Cloud /Sky /Stellar ][/Hyper /Neo /Lovely /Happy /Caller /Hound /XI /Armored /Brutal /Buster /Alpha /Chief /Provoker /Mincer /Streak /King /Prince /Power /Robo /Delver /Mystic ][M.I.D./Enterprise +1/Nautilus +!/Gilgamemnon +1/Redwing +1/Blackjack +1/Falcon +1/Highwind +1/Ragnarok +1/Hilda Garde +1/Prima Vista +1/Red Rose +1/Fahrenheit +1]!
11289 : The kid's got some talent, I'll give him that.
11290 : I told-wold you that Junior had it in him! He's figured out a way to handle the crystal-airship dichotomy!
11291 : This should make transportation between Adoulin and the Middle Lands-Wands even easier!
11292 : And opening up more trade routes would only be beneficial for all of us.
11293 : I think we all owe Midras a debt of gratitude.
11294 : Ygnas!
11295 : How do you address him? Midras! Junior!
11296 : Aaah!
11297 : Oh, phew! It's just you, %. Next time, don't sneak up on me like that!
11298 : Although I guess it's not your fault--I tend to lose myself when I'm thinking hard.
11299 : Hmmm...
11300 : What--I remember now!
11301 : %, I've got some stuff to take care of. Whatever you need from me, it'll have to wait.
11302 : I can't shirk my duties any longer!
11303 : Until next time!
11304 : You didn't manage to find Ygnas, but maybe you'll stumble upon him if you go after Midras.
11305 : Ah, if it isn't %... How's it going, friend?
11306 : Me? I've been running myself into the ground ever since the princess began pursuing her goal of living in harmony with the forest.
11307 : Hmph. I doubt you've ever rrrun a day in your life.
11308 : Ah, L-Leathery Lhe! Er, I mean, Maester Lhangavo!
11309 : Levil, how about you actually do some work for a change and visit % to prrrocure some supplies, hm?
11310 : Whaaat!?
11311 : B-but... I don't do so well in the cold...
11312 : Don't be such a frrraidy-cat. If anything happens to you, I'll be sure to properly gather your remains.
11313 : Although, if they're buried in the snow, it might pose a slight prrroblem.
11314 : Oh well. No big loss, I guess!
11315 : Y-you're colder than any mountain could ever be!
11316 : Speaking of %... I need to talk to you about Arrrciela.
11317 : She and Ygnas are currently meeting with Sajj'aka.
11318 : Naturrrally, she's seeking his counsel on the best way to live in harmony with the jungle.
11319 : I imagine she should be back any moment now.
11320 : Now then, %... Would you mind paying her a visit when you have the time?
11321 : Unlike some people we know, she's quite the industrrrious sort, never stopping to take even a moment's rest.
11322 : We can't afford to lose her and go through that whole rrruckus with the twelve orders again.
11323 : At any rate, I'm sure that she would be rrrelieved to see you.
11324 : Alrrright then, I'll leave you to it.
11325 : Phew... I was fortunately able to get out of having to go to %. It only cost me my next day off...
11326 : Although, it's not like the princess takes any breaks. I suppose I just need to buckle down and work harder.
11327 : By the way, didn't Leathery Lhe tell you to go visit Arciela?
11328 : You'd better hurry up and do it, if you know what's good for you.
11329 : You want documents about the formation of Adoulin? Hahaha, it looks like we've got a dilettante on our hands.
11330 : That industrious spirit of yours has really captured my eye. Just between you and me, why don't I give you something privy only to coalition members?
11331 : Lessee... I'm pretty sure it was...yes, the alliance agreement.
11332 : In signing this referendum, the leaders of the Twelve Orders hereby consent to the formation of a union for the express purpose of governing the Sacred City of Adoulin Alliance.
11333 : This document was drafted approximately one hundred years ago, but another hundred or so years before that, the landscape was quite different. There were multitudinous small nation-states, governed by the order leaders, and they all participated in a colonization race of sorts.
11334 : Why bother with this whole colonization effort? Simple. The resources discovered while pioneering contribute to the wealth and self-sufficiency of the nation. Finding productive soil also increases the quality of crop yields.
11335 : The colonization effort is such a wonderful thing. In truth, I can't state that loud enough. It's the best thing that ever happened to me!
11336 : So is this city. If I were to list my five favorite places in Adoulin, I'd start with the Adoulin Waterfront! Looking down on it from up high gives you possibly the best scenery you've ever witnessed in your life! It's certainly worth billions of bayld, as the saying goes.
11337 : My fourth favorite would have to be the Mummers' Coalition. A limitless paradise awaits within, and temptations abound--from the plethora of attractions to the--
11338 : Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble like that. Don't forget to show your face around here from time to time.
11339 : % made sure to leave Nikkhail's ramblings out of [his/her] notes.
11340 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
11341 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
11342 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
11343 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
11344 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).
11345 : Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.
11346 : The % nods in agreement.
11347 : new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
11348 : new Records of Eminence objective, %, is now available!
11349 : You wish to exchange your sparks?
11350 : Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
11351 : Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
11352 : Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
11353 : Thanks to your donation, I now have # % in safekeeping.
11354 : Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
11355 : Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
11356 : Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
11357 : Why? What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
11358 : Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of # % from you.
11359 : You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
11360 : Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
11361 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
11362 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
11363 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
11364 : Grrreat! Now I have # % from you. Thanks!
11365 : Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
11366 : I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
11367 : Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
11368 : I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
11369 : Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of # % for you.
11370 : Records of Eminence is a system brought to you by the caring folks at the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Set your own objectives whenever you desire, and fulfill them to receive compensation.
11371 : To set these tasks, select 'Objective List' from the Quests menu, then choose ones that suit your fancy.
11372 : You will be rewarded with gil and sparks of eminence, which serve the same function as points, notes, credits, and other such methods of quantifying one's greatness. As an extra incentive, adventurers will earn three times the amount of sparks for completing an objective the first time.
11373 : Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
11374 : As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
11375 : Lastly, any and all acts of vandalism directed against your % are strictly prohibited.
11376 : Should you be found in violation of this dictum, the heavens will part and wrath incarnate will descend to mete out justice upon you.

11442 : Resetting rewards will increase the number of deeds required but will let you reobtain items you have previously received.
11443 : You are able to reset your rewards for # deed[/s].
11444 : Reset rewards? Yes. (Reset ##) No.
11445 : You have not yet received some rewards. Resetting means that you will be unable to obtain them. Are you sure?
11446 : Really reset rewards? Yes. (Reset ##) No.
11447 : Rewards have been reset.
11448 : I promise the world will unfold before you if you set an Objective under the Records of Eminence section of the Quests menu.
11449 : Hmhmhm? Whatever could you want with me, the one-and-only Love and Peace Coalition maester?
11450 : Anything to say? That title sounds fake. You creep me out. Nothing. Just walk away.
11451 : What a cruel, cruel world we live in. The people cry out for love with their hearts, but cannot bear to do it with their lips! They long for peace, but only seem to find it in solitude!
11452 : There's nothing scary about standing in the center of Western Adoulin and professing my love for humanity. I am simply following the orders of divine provenance!
11453 : Is your love larger than the largest kingdom and softer than a sough?
11454 : What? Don't tell me you've never heard of a one-man coalition.
11455 : Wait a second...you're one of those adventurers from the Middle Lands.
11456 : Oh boy, have I got something for you... You've already accomplished your first Records of Eminence objective just by calling out to me through the depths of loneliness!
11457 : I beg you not to stop here. No matter how difficult it may seem, do not stray from the path of self-improvement.
11458 : If you won't do it for yourself, then do it for all the spoils you'll get...including my undying fraternal love for you. ...Wait but the slightest of instants.
11459 : This doll that just appeared out of thin air is called %. It archives your achievements and yours alone, so let's slap your name on it.
11460 : Eternal Flame inscribes your name upon the doll in an adorable hand.
11461 : You've taken Eternal Flame's passionately burning love deep inside yourself!
11462 : Now that you're filled with my flame of passion, you're ready to spread love and peace all over the land!
11463 : In case you didn't know, you go about doing this by adding objectives via the Objective List under the Records of Eminence section of the Quests menu.
11464 : The war for peace is never-ending, so there should be some challenges you can repeat indefinitely! Try them all out for as long as your interest holds.
11465 : Once you've accrued enough eminence, come see me. I'll give you some rewards...dripping with my love!
11466 : Oh, yeah. About that %...
11467 : ...Doing that will get it out of your hair.
11468 : It's a brand-spanking-new model developed with astral farina or something in mind. It works like the luopans geomancers use.
11469 : Until we meet again, brave [gent/maiden]. While you're at it, don't forget to point any peace lovers you see my way. I'm always looking for people to swell my ranks, if you know what I mean.
11470 : A.M.A.N. has been pulling out all the stops recently, would you not agree? Maybe I should get in tune with this new Records of Eminence thing they have created.
11471 : What? The Love and Peace Coalition? Why would you think that is real for even a moment?
11472 : Eternal Flame is simply looking for someone at whom to talk. None of the locals can stand his absurdities, so he has fallen to preying on unsuspecting pioneers.
11473 : You there.
11474 : I heard from Eternal Flame that you are to thank for reuniting his party.
11475 : Perhaps you could give me some peace of mind as well. Would you mind listening to my story?
11476 : Listen to his story? Why not? No, I can't take any more.
11477 : Very well. At least allow me to say this, however. Thank you for making this dark world a little brighter.
11478 : It all started back when I could hardly tell a saber from a scimitar.
11479 : I was roaming the woods of West Ronfaure when I was ambushed by Orcish reconnaissance. There was no hope for my survival, and I had resigned myself to my fate.
11480 : However, before they could inflict the final blow upon me, I was blanketed in a comforting light.
11481 : The wounds that rendered me nothing more than a bloody hunk of meat closed before my eyes. I felt as if I had the strength to fell a whole horde of Orcs, and succeeded handily in dispatching my aggressors.
11482 : At the battle's conclusion, I turned to face the source of that warm light. What my eyes met with was a certain Tarutaru white mage.
11483 : Her face said it all. Altruism itself seemed to have manifested upon her countenance, and the nonchalant glance she gave froze me in place. I knew my life had changed at that moment.
11484 : I immediately discarded my sword and hastened to Regine's Magicmart, where I outfitted myself in all the trappings of a white mage.
11485 : I began to tread the path of healing, determined not only to return the favor she had bestowed upon me, but also to make her recognize my proclivity for the craft.
11486 : Once I had whetted my appetite for the standard fare of sorcery, I decided to refine my palate by embarking for Castle Oztroja.
11487 : My quest to slay those unholy Yagudo acolytes took me deep within the bowels of the heap of dirt and rock they called a castle. While the journey was fraught with many dangers, it was worth it to procure spells the likes of which I had only conceptualized up until then.
11488 : With this, my role model would be unable to deny my puissance. She would shower me with praise that would validate my long excursion and prove how consummate my adoption of the white arts truly was.
11489 : Sadly, though, the truth is a fickle mistress.
11490 : I later learned from Eternal Flame that of all people in Vana'diel...
11491 : ...the very girl who saved my life was one of his partners in adventure.
11492 : The beacon of light who had shown me the way, my raison d'etre...
11493 : ...the Tarutaru with whom I wanted nothing more than to tell what she meant to me...
11494 : ...I was pushing her away from myself all along by working to become the white mage I am today.
11495 : If I had not been so devoted to this calling, she would have had more opportunities to join Flame's party and I could have come face-to-face with her.
11496 : I cursed Lady Fortune. How could I not, when my good intentions effectively drove a wedge between me and the dame?
11497 : Perhaps I should not dwell on what has come to pass, seeing as you have brought a smile to her face once more. I feel as if an incredible weight has been launched from my shoulders into the sky.
11498 : Speaking of which, you lit that ouka ranman in %, did you not?
11499 : Maybe I should return to West Ronfaure and light my own petals of recollection.
11500 : I indeed must perform some introspection. What does it mean to live as an adventurer? Why do I risk my life every day to be one?
11501 : Whether or not I find any answers there, I am greatly indebted to you.
11502 : Should you ever have the occasion to visit Jeuno, would you do me the favor of seeing how my dear white mage fares?
11503 : Altana take me! Why, if'n 'tisn't mah sweet ol' pum'kin, %!
11504 : Wescolina's eyes begin to twinkle.
11505 : Well, Ah'll be a leafkin's uncle! The day is 'pon us!
11506 : Ikhi done come o'er heah 'n show me that ol' work from the lieberry. Ah can make 'em for you, right as rain!
11507 : With all those ol' % you done brought me, should be as simpl' as pluckin' feathers from a heartwing.
11508 : 'N when it comes to clippers, you came to th' right place, fo' right and fo' true!
11509 : Our Or'er of Renaye friends have done paid mah fee in advance, so all I be needin' 'tis the materials t'emselves.
11510 : I be needin' the right amount to stitch y'self up a mess o' garments. 'Course, all d'pends on what part you want...
11511 : Check for which item? Head: %. Chest: %. Hands: %. Legs: %. Feet: % I'm done for now.
11512 : Hoo boy, %?
11513 : Lemme jus' put on mah thinkin' bonnet... Yes, I be needin' %, 'course, in addition to % and %. Yuppers, if'n you could bring those to me that'd be th' bee's knees!
11514 : But Ah know that you're busier than an alley cat durin' matin' season, so Ah can spot you some o' the materials.
11515 : So if'n you just gimme the most important parts--% and %--together with # bayld, I should be able to handle things from theah.
11516 : Criminy, %! I sweah, next time around you'll have me sewin' your unduhgahments!
11517 : Hoo hoo, I be ticklin' my funny bone!
11518 : But in the name o' ol' Zacariah, I promise that you'll have clothin' fittin' of one attuned with nature!
11519 : Positively wunn'ful, %! I trust you have th' items Ah need for your %?
11520 : Have Wecolina create your garment? By the Goddess, yes! No...stop talking.
11521 : Well, slap mah bum 'n call me Shirley, you do! Ready to have me lovin'ly stitch together your % for # bayld in place 'o th' othah materials?
11522 : Pay the price? (You have # bayld). # bayld? Absolutely, Shirley. No. Haven't I suffered enough?
11523 : But darlin', we've barely gotten started!
11524 : Right! These fingers're jus' itchin' to get down to work!
11525 : Hon, you don' have 'nough bayld.
11526 : Why, you just beam down on me like sunshine from th' heavens, don' you, %? Ah'm so glad to see you, because Ah've jus' finished your %! A fine piece o' work, if'n Ah do say so m'self.
11527 : The % Ah used for the weave is said to focus the wearer's mental acuity--that's the fancy words for noggin power. What's more 'tis both functional 'n stylish!
11528 : All th' energy contained in the % really drew forth the potential of this heah piece.
11529 : Sure gets sticky out theah in Ulbuka, no? That's why I wanted you to brin' me that %. Very breathable material that lets both air 'n magic through!
11530 : Y'know why Ah asked for %? Ain't nothin' brimming with more geomantic potential, that's why! Ah used some ol' sewing techniques passed down from th' eastern lands.
11531 : Did ya know that % are used to reduce wear 'n tear on your luopan? Mah mah, [sir/ma'am], Ah do declare that you done learn' somethin' new today!
11532 : Heah you go, dumplin'!
11533 : Well, you done look th' [han'somes'/purties'] thing I ever did see. Now go out theah and do me proud!
11534 : Hey, if you keep loitering around my property, I'm going to personally-wersonally take you down to the Waterways and feed you to--
11535 : %! If you keep loitering around my property, I'm going to personally-wersonally take you down to the Waterways and feed you to--
11536 : Ahhh, you must be one of the test subjectarus for our new insto-disemboweler. Come right this way.
11537 : What? You're here about rune fencer equipmentaru?
11538 : We've given over the rein-weins for that to Octavien. You're better off asking him directly.
11539 : Let's see this dissertation-wation of yours. Wait, this is just a copy of %. Everything written in here's common sense by now.
11540 : Huh? Why would I bother extricataruing the first letter of each line and then reading them backwards?
11541 : ...Well, I stand correctarued. It appears that the author embedded instructions for something in this document.
11542 : Apply an astral patina to certain sections... Engrave arcane glyptics of the opposing affinity... Impressive-wessive.
11543 : It goes on to mention utilizing the power of otherworldly stones to create a special form of embroidery-- Why, this is revolutionary!
11544 : I once tried manufacturing a new type of protective fabric, but had long since abandoned the idea. With this new process, though, all I'd need is % to restartaru my efforts!
11545 : From what I've heard, you must venture deep within Kamihr Drifts to an ominous bulwark. If you're able to pass through it, the curio-wurio should be all yours.
11546 : As for what horrors lie teeming behind it, I haven't the foggiestaru.
11547 : At any rate, you're the pioneer. It's your prerogative-wogative whether or not you go there. All I'm saying is that it would be nice if you helped advance our coalition's cause...and by extension, your own.
11548 : In the eventaru you do end up getting ahold of %, take it to Yestin-Ovestin. I'll tell him to expect you.
11549 : Oh, it's you. Leave me alone and get lostaru!
11550 : Now we're talking. I thought I'd have to sitaru through a bunch of small talk and begging before getting down to business-wusiness.
11551 : Amchuchu finally took off her kid glove-woves and gave me a copy of %, but never did I think that I'd be able to lay eyes on %.
11552 : I suppose this is an offer I can't refuse-wuse, seeing as how you've already done the dirty work.
11553 : As for payment, don't worry. The Inventors' Coalition has already forked over more than the likes of you could afford. Just bring me the requisitaru materials.
11554 : You tell me the armor, I tell you what materials to bring so I can craftaru it, and you go get them. No backtalk, snide remarks, or unnecessary questions from you.
11555 : What piece of armor? Head: %. Body: %. Hands: %. Legs: %. Feet: %. None. I'm done.
11556 : You want %, huh? If that's the case...
11557 : There's no negotiataruing the %. However, the % and % we can work with. And none of this one-by-one stuff, either. Gimme them all at once.
11558 : If you're too lazy to bother getting the last two materials, feel free to skip them...as long as you have enough bayld-wayld.
11559 : Just so you don't come disturbing-wurbing me in the middle of more important things, let me spell it out for you. Have # bayld on hand if you only bring % and %.
11560 : I can't wait to be the firstaru person in known history to forge these pieces. Look, my legs are tremble-wembling in anticipation!
11561 : I take it I don't have to tell you not to worry, for why would a philistine-wilistine question the techniques of a master like me?
11562 : Greataru, everything's here. Just so you don't come crying to me later, are you sure you want me to craft %?
11563 : Have him craft it? Well, I didn't get these for nothing. Not if he takes that tone.
11564 : Well, I'll make you your %, but since you didn't bring everything, you'd better have # bayld on you.
11565 : Do you? (Total: #) Yep, gimme. Nope, sucker.
11566 : What in the... You can't just back out now! This isn't about you anymore; it's about the fame and recognition-wition I'd gain for making the bestaru livery in the land!
11567 : It's always nice when minions do what they're told. Now run along and let the wizards wiz.
11568 : With your total inability to grasp simple numbers, it's a wonder you can so much as drool while you stare at nothing in particular-wicular.
11569 : Here you go, your new %. And since I was in such a good mood toward the end, I engrave-waved some arcane glyptics to sweeten the deal.
11570 : This % resonatarus with your runes to create a membrane of protective magic. While it may be as thin as my patience with greenhorns, it'll stop the brunt of any physical attack.
11571 : It's no plate mail, but the % and % within it work together to amplify your runes' defensive powers by several magnitude-wagnitudes.
11572 : Gloves of grace, these. The % I used to fashion them should be supple-wupple enough to enhance the Swordplay of even the clumsiest fencer.
11573 : The % from which I sewed them acts to buttress the varied magicks that aid your companion-wanions. Never before has such a thing been attempted, making my accomplishmentaru all the more savory.
11574 : The % I imbued this piece with enables you to deflectaru weapons as deftly as a princess does to unfit suitors at a ball.
11575 : Take it now. If I hold onto this piece of perfection any longer, my heart'll meltaru and I'll never be able to give it up.
11576 : Work on your new equipment will begin immediately.
11577 : You exchanged # bayld.
11578 : Hmmm... Quite the quandary, this is...
11579 : Wait, aren't you that rune fencer whom I can never quite seem to remember? What brings you to the Inventors' Coalition?
11580 : Well, if that's the case, I'm having trouble with this runic caliper here. Every time I try to open it, the thing screeches like a dying umbril and refuses to budge!
11581 : I want to fix it, but I don't have any of the % used in making its ethereal lubricant. What a pain it's going to be to find them...
11582 : Have anything to say? Should I get some for you? Have fun with that.
11583 : It may be presumptuous of me, but I'm swamped with repair orders! I've no time to venture into the wilds, risking life and limb for an ingredient.
11584 : Please, think of the coalition!
11585 : You've truly brightened me day. It's so comforting to know that there are still kind souls on this harsh frontier.
11586 : Now, I've never heard of a lone %, but you can probably find them packed into clumps within Yorcia Weald.
11587 : Maybe the Scouts' Coalition can dig up some dirt with just their eyes and ears, but I think you'll be needing % or two for this job.
11588 : Splendid! Your selfless act is duly noted, fair pioneer.
11589 : Yes, this is exactly what the inventor ordered! No terrifying screams, and look how it opens! This baby's smoother than a merchant's tongue!
11590 : Who knows, I might actually get that thing back to Runje Desaali before she skins my hide.
11591 : She's nice enough outside of work, but don't ever get on her bad side when doing business with her. You'll likely end up sleeping with the orobons off the waterfront.
11592 : Ohoho, and to what do I owe this pleas--
11593 : There you are. I'd been waiting so long I had one footaru in the grave. Anyway, I suppose congratulations are in order.
11594 : Gaddiux, hand the rune fencer [his/her] rightful-wightful due for soaring to such heights.
11595 : Um... Pardon my ignorance, but what exactly am I supposed to give [him/her]?
11596 : Tsk, tsk, tsk...such uncharacteristic incompetence-wompetence from you. The reward we bestow upon the one who bears the mark of %, that's what.
11597 : Maybe I need to be more directaru. Take a closer look at that which once took the form of a runic caliper.
11598 : Why would you want me to look at such a boring-- What the!? When did it become a sword!?
11599 : I never thoughtaru someone worthy of receiving this blade would appear in my lifetime.
11600 : In case you were unaware, it is % and has been passed down through the Order of Orvail for generation-wations.
11601 : As I've already said, you have all the right in the world to take up this sword. There is no reason to hesitataru.
11602 : Why was it necessary to transmogrify it into a tool, though?
11603 : Elementary, my dear Gaddiux. It was to prevent its theftaru. While many petty thieves and renowned cat burglars alike would love to get their hands on our order's bladed heirloom, who wants to steal a caliper?
11604 : Although, I'd be surprised if anyone still remembers its existence-wistence. Either way, you can never be too careful.
11605 : Keep in mind that while we are the ones to bequeath this to you, we are simply the conduits by which it expresses its will. We did not choose you as its bearer--the sword itself did.
11606 : As for how you decide to use it...that is completaruly up to you.
11607 : I'm happy for your accomplishment and all, but how am I supposed to measure runic equipment without a caliper?
11608 : And so your journey ends where it began. There's not much else to say...
11609 : ...Except that I've been keeping something from you, %.
11610 : The sword you're holding is far older than you suspect.
11611 : Marjami herself once wielded it to execute her unique style of swordplay, christened Thaumaturgic Twine.
11612 : She used it to weave the elements together into a tapestry of offensive might and defensive prowess over a millennium ago. Somehow, it has survived unchanged through the centuries.
11613 : However, that all ends today.
11614 : Your % shall be reborn with the power to usher in a new era for rune fencers the world over.
11615 : Thanks to the ingenuity of the Inventors' Coalition, Marjami's sword has transcended time and coalesced into the finest manifestation of runic dynamism ever.
11616 : Innovations that are fun for the whole family, safe and reliable services, and not a hint of--hm?
11617 : Wait, you're...c'mon, I know I can get it this time...%?
11618 : I heard you've matured into quite the rune fencer.
11619 : ...Exactly the type who could complete this assignment, I'd say.
11620 : We desperately need your finely honed skills to test the durability of this greatsword here. Sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime, right?
11621 : How does it sound? Good enough. Yay, science! Stupid, that's how.
11622 : Oh... In hindsight, I guess it kind of does. You might be too renowned for this type of thing, but your cooperation would still be appreciated.
11623 : I suppose you've taken time to think my offer over. So, how does flailing around a greatsword sound now?
11624 : It's always good to meet someone with a burning passion for discovery.
11625 : What makes this especially intriguing for aficionados of experimentation is that this sword has been altered to record data regarding usage.
11626 : We really outdid ourselves with it. The device we forged into this weapon can accurately measure the bearer's swings down to a thousandth of an ilm.
11627 : With such an awe-inspiring revision, I'd be amazed if something didn't happen by employing weapon skills while using it. You can never tell what sort of gore will ensue with them normally, so this should really be a feast for the eyes.
11628 : All I can say is that I'll need it back after you've unleashed your weapon skills a number of times that I deem sufficient.
11629 : Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, I can't wait to--hey, it says you haven't even used it once!
11630 : Hmmm... If I look really hard, I think I can see some space between the needle and the baseline.
11631 : I see, I see... That's smack-dab in the middle of the meter, I'd say.
11632 : Ohohoho! You're extremely close. It's almost as if the needle's about to fly off the gauge, so palpable is the tension.
11633 : If Amchuchu's hypothesis is correct, just keep swinging away and you'll eventually get there. Don't lose hope.
11634 : How's the experiment going? Does it measure up to your expectations? Heh heh.
11635 : Anything to say? No issues here. I lost my %. I've had enough of this.
11636 : What!? How could you!?
11637 : Luckily, we also live by the words Always be prepared. Use this one instead.
11638 : We're not miracle workers, though. We can't recover any of the information stored on the old device, so you'll have to start over from scratch.
11639 : Don't be too hasty now! All the results you've archived will be struck from the record if you give up! Doesn't that bother you in the least?
11640 : Does it bother you? No, I'm through. Yes, let me think on it.
11641 : Phew...I had little pools of sweat welling up from my hands when you told me you were out.
11642 : ...If that's how you're going to be, there's little I can do. Hopefully we'll find an intrepid soul who wishes to see the whole thing to fruition.
11643 : Oh, that's right. You can dispose of that % if you want. It's basically worthless now.
11644 : Wonderful! It looks like we have a large enough sample to make some real inroads here.
11645 : Thank you so much for your help and for the sword back. To compensate for your troubles, we'd like to pay you some bayld.
11646 : ...Huh. I can't help but be a little disappointed that nothing of a revolutionary nature happened even though the gauge is full...
11647 : Gaddiux, how goes the testaruing?
11648 : M-Maester Amchuchu!?
11649 : Well, if it isn't %. I hope sling-winging that blade hasn't tired your arms out too much.
11650 : Aha, so you're the one who fell victim--er, to whom it fell to perform the field-wield test. Thanks.
11651 : I'd been keeping this to myself, but I might as well share it now. That sword has been specially designed to bestow its latentaru powers upon whoever uses it.
11652 : Since when did it do anything like that!?
11653 : Since I was inspired by a muse, that's when. I imbued it with a technique unlike anything any rune fencer has wielded before.
11654 : And in honor of its innovative nature, I've dubbed it Dimidiation! Naw, I'm only pulling your leg. I named it that because I think it sounds really foreboding-woding.
11655 : Either way, we complete our experimentaru and you learn a new battle tactic. It's a win-win situation!
11656 : Can't you feel-weel it already? Maybe you've got chills multiplying or some power's electrifying?
11657 : Even if you don't, you should be able to use the skill with any sword, not just the one I develop-weloped.
11658 : Go on, try it outaru. I won't stop you.
11659 : You have learned Dimidiation!
11660 : I bet Svenja's been a mistress to more men than there are bricks in Jorius Yett! She corrupts every man she meets.
11661 : What will you do? Start a conversation with her. Stand back and watch the show.
11662 : Grrr... How can you men go all dopey-faced for that harpy!?
11663 : Well, they won't be smiling when she spurns their affections next time they talk!
11664 : <Blech> Why would any self-respecting man go flush over someone as base as Svenja!?
11665 : Enjoy her feigned affection while you can, because you'll be crying yourself to sleep when she tosses you aside like yesterday's garbage!
11666 : Men shouldn't c-concern themselves with immoral slatterns like her. They should strive to develop purer relationships with other men! Yes, start with the seed of an awkward conversation that sprouts up a deep friendship, then blossoms into something more...
11667 : Yeees!
11668 : <Pant> <heave> Perhaps Adoulin's future is bright after all.
11669 : Aaaaaaaaah! Wh-wh-who's there!?
11670 : Oh, it's you... How long have you been snooping around?
11671 : Let's clear up any misunderstandings that might arise from your shoddy investigating! I was simply gathering intelligence on the Order of Janniston, and nothing more.
11672 : As it happens, I've no further business here, so I'll be taking my leave now.
11673 : Yeesh! This looks to be quite the fixer-upper.
11674 : I'll see what I can do. I don't think I'll have any problems with it, but you never know.
11675 : Wait here, I'll be right back.
11676 : Here you go.
11677 : Sorry, but this is the best I could do. All that rust proved a bit much for me.
11678 : I guess you could always hang it in your Mog House or something. At least I'm not going to charge you for not fixing it.
11679 : Some of us at the Inventors' Coalition like to say that our craft is realizing people's dreams. I'm a little more direct, though. I just say I fix stuff up.
11680 : Hm? You wish to hear about the olden days of colonization?
11681 : Well, I am never one to turn down a chance to tell a story. How about this one?
11682 : You have knowledge of Sverdhried--or at least his eponymous hillock--correct? Well, he supposedly traveled around the world, visiting each and every continent.
11683 : If I have yet to lose my marbles, that should have taken place around the time colonization was taking off.
11684 : Furthermore, I hear that a long-lost civilization exists on the frozen continent of Rhazowa.
11685 : Whether that is genuine fact or pure conjecture I cannot say.
11686 : You will have to use your own powers of deduction to determine that yourself.
11687 : I have nothing against pioneers...as long as they understand the possible repercussions of their actions.
11688 : Hm? You have business with Maester Reginald?
11689 : He is currently away on business, but I will assist you in any way I am able.
11690 : Have any inquiries to make? I've undertaken many courier assignments. Tell me about Souffriand's death. I'll be leaving. Show him the %.
11691 : The coalition greatly appreciates all the work you have put into the pioneering efforts. We hope you continue to serve us well into the future.
11692 : Yes...that was a dark time for Adoulin.
11693 : Hm? Ah, yes, I was one of the guards accompanying him that day.
11694 : I see. You're investigating the circumstances surrounding the accident.
11695 : Hmph. No one else believes us, so why should you? I've nothing to say on the matter.
11696 : Urk--!?
11697 : Th-that's Melvien?
11698 : Oh, the poor lad...
11699 : ...No. A grown man should never be moved to tears.
11700 : Fine. I will share with you what happened that day.
11701 : It was not just Melvien and Souffriand who ventured out. It was a unit headed by Reginald and his honor guard.
11702 : The two were accompanying them, not the other way around.
11703 : Still, it was a small regiment, numbering a half dozen, including two of the city's most decorated soldiers. As the junior of the group, my glorious duties included hauling supplies and shining boots.
11704 : The incident occurred as we were conducting a survey in Marjami Ravine, just across the border from Yorcia Weald.
11705 : Despite the sky being as blue as the Senroh Sea, a forked bolt of lightning split the sky, striking Souffriand and Melvien each on the head.
11706 : The two leaders were injured in the ensuing shockwave, driving the team into a confused frenzy.
11707 : I would scarce believe that such a phenomenon could happen in a cloudless sky were I not there myself.
11708 : Talk about hearts stopping is oft hyperbolic, but Melvien and Souffriand suffered exactly that. The entourage was wrapped in despair.
11709 : What choice did we have but to teleport back to town with the four victims?
11710 : As soon as we returned, I hurried to the Order of Janniston and banged on the door.
11711 : White mages were dispatched posthaste, but my two superiors...did not make it.
11712 : Souffriand did not even make it that far.
11713 : Melvien, however, made a miraculous recovery.
11714 : It was the sole point of light in a darkened sky.
11715 : There is nothing left to tell. Do you believe me to tell the truth, or do you doubt like so many before you?
11716 : What do you think? I believe you. You've got to be joking.
11717 : I know not whether your words are fair or farce, but I thank you nonetheless. None would even go so far as to feign belief.
11718 : Hahaha... Of course you don't. It goes against all the laws of nature. ...Forget I said anything.
11719 : You scribble down information regarding %.
11720 : You've got what you came for. Return to Margret with what you've learned.
11721 : Oh my! Hi, %!
11722 : How spectabular that we ran into each other!
11723 : I'd been looking in every nook and cranny for you, never thinking that maybe you would come to me!
11724 : I've got some great news to share. The besmirching of Zacariah's reputation has started to stop...if that makes sense.
11725 : I can finally hold my head high and take pride in my geomantic heritage--and I have you to thank for it.
11726 : Lhaiso's training at the Order of Renaye may be positively frazzling, but the joy of feeling accepted gives me the strength to press on.
11727 : But you know what? Something bugs me.
11728 : Exactly what was Daddy doing out there in Morimar Basalt Fields?
11729 : He'd always blended pioneering and geomancering like coffee and cream, so maybe he was off hunting for new ergon loci.
11730 : And maybe that's exactly the kinda thing he was best at.
11731 : But...but...
11732 : I dunno. My memories and mind are all muddled. More than usual, I mean.
11733 : It's tough for me to admit this.
11734 : But when Lhaiso called for a Communion and spanked the life outta those baddies, all I could think about was Daddy.
11735 : The episode eats at me even now. I'd like to go back and get some...closure, I suppose?
11736 : And if someone like you, someone who can call forth their own Communion, were by my side...
11737 : Ugh. I'm starting to tear up already.
11738 : I just want you to be there with me, okay?
11739 : Accompany the wayward geomancer? I'll pack my bags. No dice.
11740 : %, please! I'm about to burst into a thousand itty-bitty bits!
11741 : I've gotta check out what Daddy was working on.
11742 : Please, %! Come with me to Morimar Basalt Fields!
11743 : Th-thanks. I mean it. Last I heard, his group had discovered a little something special in the northeast, somewhere around J-6.
11744 : I'll be just a bell ring behind you!
11745 : Daddy's investigations took him near J-6 in northeastern Morimar Basalt Fields.
11746 : Beneath a frozen flower hanging over boiling magma...
11747 : The Scouts' Coalition told me that it probably refers to an ergon locus.
11748 : Pioneers often refer to it as the frostbloom. I just know that's where we've got to head!
11749 : %, I'm sorry for acting so emotional about Daddy.
11750 : My head was swimming even more than usual, and I had no idea what to do.
11751 : But I promise that I'm back in top-tip shape!
11752 : I returned the bell to Lhaiso at the Order of Renaye, but I knew that Daddy would want the garments to remain safe with Zacariah.
11753 : After all, he trusts me to make sure the craft is not lost to the ages.
11754 : I picked through Daddy's personal effects, and sure enough--three crystals and a treatise on crafting robes just like those Sih Renaye wore.
11755 : The pieces he mentioned were contained in the same box.
11756 : I had sweet old Wescolina take a look, and she confirmed what Daddy wrote.
11757 : The cloth has faint magical residue, but never had she seen any of its make on the Ulbukan continent.
11758 : When I passed the crystals over the top, an image of a place in the Middle Lands came to mind--just as Daddy predicted.
11759 : A saw a large ruin...and you were there, too, collecting soil.
11760 : Remember when I had you gather some so we could fashion your luopan?
11761 : So wouldn't it make sense that there's some connection? My hunches are never wrong! ...Except when they are.
11762 : And so! I have another request of you.
11763 : Could you take this crystal and examine the soil there?
11764 : You're the only one from the Middle Lands I can ask!
11765 : Which would you like? Nothing for now. %. (CL: #) %. (CL: #)  %. (CL: #) I need transportation.
11766 : Maybe...maybe you're right. There're some things I gotta do for myself.
11767 : I'll see if I can find other clues. But you come running back to me the moment you find anything out, okay?
11768 : %, I'd still like you to find some of that soil for me...if you're free.
11769 : The vision clearly depicted a green highland filled with large, majestic sheep.
11770 : I'm very worried--something just didn't seem right. But if you don't go alone you might not succeed.
11771 : So you will take this % for me?
11772 : What will you do? Take the %. I need time to think.
11773 : A highland lined with windmills...and a large plain stretching out as far as the eye can see.
11774 : It might be a little dangerous to go there alone, but I'm worried that the energies may dissipate if you don't.
11775 : But you know your way around a luopan, so it should be no trouble.
11776 : H-how did you know about that!? I swear I was hiding it really well!
11777 : This one, uh... This one's a bit dangerous.
11778 : The crystal should resonate in a large, desolate canyon, but--pretty please, don't go there!
11779 : One wrong move and you'll be turned into steak tartare!
11780 : The battle is intended for a lone [geomancer/rune fencer], and its content level is #. Only the fittest of [geomancers/rune fencers] can emerge victorious.
11781 : People tell me I'm insane, but you're about to take it to a completely different level!
11782 : Promise me that you'll stay safe. And if you want to choose a different crystal instead, all you have to do is speak to me.
11783 : Oh, thank the heavens! I was worried that you got squished into a bloody pulp!
11784 : I figured out how to make those crystals Daddy saved up, so I can give you another one if you want to try again.
11785 : I could feel it, %. I could feel that you purged the dark clouds surrounding the %.
11786 : %, you've shown me what it means to be a true geomancer!
11787 : Oh my, %!
11788 : I've never seen anything so gorgeous! The vibrant colors glisten like precious metal!
11789 : B-but we don't have enough time to sit here raving about victory.
11790 : We, uh... We have to craft it now, right?
11791 : I'll give you the guide that Daddy left. I'm sure Wescolina would know what to do with it.
11792 : I-I think we did it, Daddy.
11793 : I hope you're proud of me. I hope Zacariah would be proud of me, too.
11794 : Ah, pumpkin, how sweet of ya to come drop your saddlebags down heah. You need me ta make somethin'?
11795 : Show her Hostenn's effects? Yes. Just a peek. No.
11796 : Sugah, why you be lookin' a' me like that?
11797 : Aha! You can't be pullin' the wool ovah this one's eyes.
11798 : Ah' can't be helpin' you wit' that, honey. Whatevah would mah hubby say?
11799 : Mebbe Ah can give you a cream that'll help get ya skin lookin' as white an' feelin' as silky as mahne!
11800 : What be tha' thing o' yours, sweetie?
11801 : It's not nahce ta tease a gentlewoman like mahself!
11802 : Well slap mah bum an' call meh Shirley! That dun be th' purtiest-lookin' cloth Ah e'er did see!
11803 : It kinda looks like th' torn garm'nt tha' Sylvie dun shown me, but...
11804 : 'S that now? It's tha same one?
11805 : Altana, save me!
11806 : Now wait a cotton-pickin' minute. That mus' mean that ol' Hostenn...
11807 : Oho, th' boy's magic dun did it aftah all!
11808 : If onl' he were 'live to see it with those blue eyes o' his.
11809 : Mah, mah, but Ah do declare Ah detect a bit o' impatience in those eyeballs o' yours. Back to th' topic at hand, then.
11810 : Mah hubby sure know a thing er two 'bout fashionin' geomantic attire, but he prolly can' do what you're lookin' for.
11811 : But dun you fret none!
11812 : Ah can introduce you to th' woman who trained mah hubby.
11813 : She works o'er in a place known as Selbina, far 'cross th' Senroh Sea.
11814 : She's a mastah clothcraftah, so if you head to the guild there you can sur'ly find'er.
11815 : Ah see you dun met with Helina. hmm?
11816 : Mah hubby, bless his heart, can' hold a candle to 'er.
11817 : He's always goin' about sayin' he's still got much to learn...an' he truly do.
11818 : But he's still mah lil' dumplin' and Ah love him to bits!
11819 : Someone from Selbina is making the attire for you?
11820 : That's fantabulicious, %! Come show me when it's done!
11821 : Howdy there, %!
11822 : Are you going to tell me another story of your exploits?
11823 : Just let me know if you want another crystal!
11824 : Unfortunately, I don't have any more. But in just a little while I may be able to turn that frown downside-up!
11825 : Would you like me to send you to the site via that little waypoint over there?
11826 : Of course, I'll pay your way as a token of my gratitude!
11827 : Head for [La Theine Plateau/Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]? Hold on. Let's do this!
11828 : Best of luck!
11829 : I've explained the dangers to you before...but if you've done it once, you can do it again.
11830 : Don't go getting yourself killed!
11831 : Ah, what a beautiful day to be me... Oho, a thousand pardons. You are one of those new pioneers, are you not?
11832 : See Big Bridge over there? You can reach Eastern Adoulin just by crossing it...or did you know that already?
11833 : My grandfather, Octavien, waits on Sverdhried Hillock to instruct newcomers in the runic arts. He might not hold a candle to me now, but I am sure his training would suffice for the likes of you.
11834 : Well, well... Someone whose runes shine almost as brightly as my own. A rune fencer, are you not?
11835 : Yes, as my own. For I, too, am a rune fencer.
11836 : My grandfather's endless prattling doubtless bored you to tears.
11837 : I promise that you will not find my lessons to be even half as tedious.
11838 : These flowers are nearly as fair as my own face.
11839 : Ah, but you must be %. Word of your exploits has reached me here.
11840 : And if you are half the [man/woman] they say you are, then I have need of your aid.
11841 : Lend a hand? Accept his task. Flee like the wind.
11842 : A gallant rune fencer appears miraculously before me and vanishes like petals on the wind. You are more than meets the eye, my friend!
11843 : Excellent. I admit to being slightly surprised that you would agree without knowing the exact content...but not overly so.
11844 : You see, Amchuchu is proceeding with a highly classified project, one that requires a discreet hand.
11845 : Rune fencer equipment has remained largely unchanged over the centuries.
11846 : They remain based in the musings of Sverdhried and the historical records kept in Celennia Memorial Library, with artisans faithfully reproducing the pieces in both form and function.
11847 : Behind the scenes, however, Amchuchu has been working on some modifications that would change the way we approach our craft.
11848 : One member of our ranks is in the final phases of testing the pieces' durability as we speak, and all that remains is to collect new materials from the depths of Ra'Kaznar.
11849 : ...Or so we had hoped. Amchuchu lost all contact with the team she sent to gather the requisite goods.
11850 : So we have been on the lookout for someone of your caliber who can probe deep into the labyrinth and find out exactly what happened.
11851 : I would go myself, but I am suffering from [a splitting headache/colossal stomach cramps/unbearable knee agony/a strained elbow joint/a terrible hamstring injury/wracking chest pain].
11852 : And further, I have accumulated enough glory that I figured I should share the limelight with those less fortunate.
11853 : So, will you undertake this task as a fellow rune fencer-at-arms?
11854 : Assist your brethren? Of course! No, thanks.
11855 : H-huh? What? Oh, no way!
11856 : I would like you to head to Outer Ra'Kaznar and surreptitiously confirm the situation. If you will not do it for me, then do it for the children!
11857 : I knew the talk about you was more than idle gossip!
11858 : Forgive me for sounding like a broken orchestrion, but I would ask that you check on the coalition staff currently dispatched to Outer Ra'Kaznar.
11859 : So...have at it!
11860 : If nothing ill has happened, you should be able to meet up in the large room located right near the entrance.
11861 : It is critical that this mission end in success!
11862 : What happened?
11863 : Mikolulu is holed up in Outer Ra'Kaznar, pining for me to make a revolutionary breakthrough?
11864 : Well, it would not do to keep such a lovely mademoiselle waiting, would it?
11865 : And she wants me to infuse % with each of the eight elements.
11866 : If I were a betting man, I would wager that Middle Lands devices used to manufacture weapons hold the key to our success. My grandfather often mentioned such contraptions.
11867 : So I asked a trusted contact within the Inventors' Coalition to craft special cores that can draw forth the power of the elements.
11868 : I refer to them as iridal cores.
11869 : The craftsman may have done the legwork, but I can safely take all the credit for the planning and design.
11870 : Setting these cores in one of those strange apparatuses will surely enable us to create a blade bathed in the aforementioned energies.
11871 : It may be a tad volatile at first, but calming it down will release the elemental forces...
11872 : At which point we bind it with the % to harness the full potential! Simple, effective, and quite likely thorough.
11873 : Of course, this would be a mere trifle for one of my ability.
11874 : There is but one hitch. I am currently swamped with other forms of revolutionary research and could not possibly spare the time to go myself.
11875 : And even if I could, I have never been to the Middle Lands, and it might take me months--years!--to find my way there.
11876 : How do you respond? Don't worry. I'll handle it. Good luck with that.
11877 : Urk...I would go, of course, but there's no time! And without any knowledge of the Middle Lands, it would be an exercise in futility!
11878 : I would like you to make haste for the Middle Lands and use the iridal core in one of those strange devices.
11879 : I would go myself, but I have been selected to be a judge in the Inventors' Coalition's next major competition, so I have been in a tizzy just trying to keep up...
11880 : I would go myself, but the Mistress Svenja Fan Club has put me in charge of drafting their monthly newsletter, and my expos on the kindness she shows to those in the Order of Janniston's infirmary will keep me tied up for days--weeks!
11881 : Y-you will? Then let us get started!
11882 : There are several cores to choose from, so pick the one that you feel would be the most appropriate.
11883 : Receive which item? I'm not ready. %. (CL: #) %. (CL: #)  %. (CL: #) Send me to where I should go.
11884 : Were you not...were you not going to take a core to help me out?
11885 : This core will resonate with an interesting apparatus in the ruins known as Fei'Yin...if that name means anything to you.
11886 : One of the coalition members has done a bit of research, and the place is quite dangerous to traverse alone--but the device will only activate if a single individual is present.
11887 : Is this % your choice?
11888 : This core was made to interact with a device found in some king's tomb...Ranperre, was it?
11889 : A team dispatched to the area has confirmed that hearty, battle-seasoned pioneers should be safe going there alone--and that the device will only respond in such conditions.
11890 : With all the notches on your belt, doubtless you would be up to the task[/, Sword Saint].
11891 : Have you lost your mind!?
11892 : There's a reason I didn't offer it to you.
11893 : The device this core is attuned to is in Ranguemont Pass...
11894 : ...But I am more than sure that it is broken. I refuse to be held responsible for what happens if you go there.
11895 : This one is a bit special, and will only respond to a lone rune fencer.
11896 : As you are well aware, not everyone can join our order, so our data on this fine specimen is quite sparse.
11897 : It would be wholly irresponsible of me to entrust it to you.
11898 : Of course, I would be willing to part with it should you claim to be the strongest rune fencer ever known to man!
11899 : Let us hope that your nerves of steel are not foolhardiness in disguise.
11900 : I would like you to head to the aforementioned device in the Middle Lands and utilize the core I have entrusted to your care.
11901 : Or would a different core be more to your liking?
11902 : Huh? What happened to your core?
11903 : You lost your core? Ugh. I wonder if I truly picked the proper [man/woman] for the job.
11904 : Fortunately, I have more in my possession--but promise you will not lose this one.
11905 : Amazing! Look at it sparkle!
11906 : Hurry! Take it to Amchuchu's laboratory at once!
11907 : Intriguing. Improving upon % to create-wate %.
11908 : An impressive feataru in and of itself. Take pride in what you've done, Mikolulu!
11909 : Amchuchu, I was sure that I could have...I mean, theoretarucally, it should have been complete.
11910 : If only I had more time-wime...
11911 : Oho! What brings you here?
11912 : %! Could that be...?
11913 : Hang on a sec! It's...fully completaru!
11914 : You--you did it! You found a method-wethod for infusing it with the elements?
11915 : How do you respond? It's thanks to Octavernost's research. It's thanks to the iridal cores.
11916 : He inventarued the iridal cores?
11917 : I see. He took my designs and plans and gave-wave them form.
11918 : You mean the theories that I designed and plans-wans based on discussions between Octavernost and I were finally given form?
11919 : But who could have done such a thing?
11920 : Octavernost? Him?
11921 : I'm just glad to know that all my research wasn't for naughtaru.
11922 : Splendid! You two did magnificentaruly.
11923 : Octavernost sure knows how to pull through when needed-weeded. Now if only he could rein in that attitude of his!
11924 : I'll head back to Ra'Kaznar. My research into protectaruing rune fencers must continue!
11925 : Amchuchu, the Zurk has brought back his reportaru on number eleven...
11926 : Urg...
11927 : Salutations, Zurko.
11928 : We've got the material. We've got the data. Now it's my turn!
11929 : ...Seeya.
11930 : Hey, Zurko. I'd like to give you the first setaru of armor we create--once it's completed, of course.
11931 : ...
11932 : And I'll have something to discuss with you then.
11933 : Amchuchu...
11934 : Let % be the first to try-wy it on.
11935 : But what about you, decked out in that heavy monstrosity-wosity like you are?
11936 : Hmph. You may fancy it a prison, but there's no better way to contain the blinding light of my soul and the unbridled power that courses through my veins.
11937 : ...And further, I have a divine mission-wission to carry out in Mhaura.
11938 : Anastase is such a worrywart, so I've got to sidle-widle back to Mhaura before he notices.
11939 : Right when I thought he'd finally matured, he's back to his old bluster-wuster and bravado.
11940 : <Sigh> But I've more importantaru things to worry about.
11941 : And the name of this revolutionary new armor shall be...Erilaz! And I shall present you with the first set, as Zurko requestarued.
11942 : I'll deliver it to Octavernost, but hold on a little while longer before bothering-wothering him.
11943 : The sound of leather being torn and sown together floats to your ears from somewhere in the distance.
11944 : Wooo! Wait until Amchuchu gets worrrd of this!
11945 : Hmmm hmmm hmmm....
11946 : Our favorite rune fencer will be happy to see that-- Yestin? Are you crrrying?
11947 : Shutaru your trap! There'll be hell to pay if you don't get these in fighting form chop-chop!
11948 : ...Tee-hee.
11949 : Oh oh, [my fine friend/dear Sword Saint], have you come to acquire your due?
11950 : Good things come to those who wait--and wait you must.
11951 : This is the latest apple of Amchuchu's most discerning eye--%.
11952 : And leave it to her to provide a detailed explanation.
11953 : <% instruction manual> The bearer of this piece will be afforded with arcane glyptics that offer increased offensive vigor and the ability to convert physical wounds into spiritual energy.
11954 : The surface is coated with a substance that attracts the attention of [his/her] opponent, making it an excellent addition to the arsenal of those who seek to shelter their allies from harm.
11955 : Hohoho! How fabulous! My armor is but a test piece, so I must admit to being a trifle jealous.
11956 : I can feel the upswell of power just from holding it in my hands.
11957 : Our maester gave this piece her all, so wear it with pride!
11958 : Ah, %. Good to see you this day.
11959 : My dearest %, the sun shines ever brighter each time we meet.
11960 : Ah, Sword Saint. You honor me with your presence.
11961 : What do you require? Nothing in particular. I'd like some erilaz armor. I'd like a new iridal core.
11962 : I am more than glad to ask Amchuchu to make you another piece. Do note that the materials are somewhat rare, so I implore you to procure them yourself.
11963 : Which piece would you like? None for now. Galea. Surcoat. Gauntlets. Leg guards. Greaves.
11964 : Hold on a tick... Here. An instruction manual from Amchuchu.
11965 : <% instruction manual> This galea amplifies the rune fencer's natural healing energies and removes ill effects that may have hindered [his/her] progress.
11966 : It also harnesses energies latent in the atmosphere to lengthen the effects of magics that strengthen the rune fencer, and the coalition hopes that it serves to better protect the wearer from harm.
11967 : <% instruction manual> The grip of these gauntlets has been adjusted to allow for easier wielding of great swords on the field of battle.
11968 : A baseline of defensive runic energy inscribed into the palms protects the wearer from all manner of calamities, making for an exquisite piece for those fighting on the front lines.
11969 : <% instruction manual> The posterior section is designed to absorb shocks and prevent blunt trauma, thus softening any physical harm that comes to the wearer.
11970 : The frontal design draws enemies' eyes naturally to the rune fencer, making these leg guards ideal for those prepared to practice parrying.
11971 : <% instruction manual> These greaves boast a blend of various magical coatings that shield the wearer from all manner of elemental attacks.
11972 : As with many other pieces in this set, vibrant coloring and sturdy construction ensure both attention and physical protection, making this an ideal piece to bring into battle against magic-wielding foes.
11973 : I require the following items should this be the piece you desire.
11974 : % will serve as the base, and % and % shall make the perfect accents.
11975 : I see that you[/, Sword Saint,] are the bearer of %.
11976 : This being the case, we can substitute more generic materials and achieve exactly the same effects as the original.
11977 : As such, I only require the base item: %.
11978 : Of course, if you'd rather use materials that the coalition has on hand, # ) will suffice as payment.
11979 : Then the deal is done. Which piece would you like?
11980 : Which piece would you like? None for now. Galea. Surcoat. Gauntlets. Leg guards. Greaves.
11981 : Ah, yes. %. Perfect choice--but are you sure?
11982 : Order %? That would be splendid. I need time to think.
11983 : I shall forward your request to Amchuchu forthwith. Be warned that she may keep you waiting a tad.
11984 : As much as I would like to give you one, I have none on hand. I expect a shipment to come in the next few days, however, and would be happy to part with one when the time comes.
11985 : Your battle in Ranguemont Pass is the stuff of legends, %!
11986 : Sword Saint, you are a rune fencer worthy of Sverdhried's legacy!
11987 : I can utilize the runic tablets gathered by the Inventors' Coalition to transport you directly to one of the devices.
11988 : It will be a one-way journey, but I trust you can make it back whole!
11989 : Teleport to [Fei'Yin/King Ranperre's Tomb/Ranguemont Pass]? Not just yet. Beam me up!
11990 : Best of luck!
11991 : You'll have to head to Ranguemont Pass, where the biggest of trials awaits. But no challenge is too overwhelming for a sword saint!
11992 : Good luck!
11994 : Need something fixed then? Take a number and get back in... Hold on. That's %.
11995 : Lemme get a look at it. See this glowing piece of work right here? We call it a capacitor. Made it myself.
11996 : What in blazes...
11997 : You don't mean you actually used the thing?
11998 : How do you respond? Yup! I used it! No. I knew better.
11999 : And a good thing, too. It coulda bought you a one-way ticket to the void!
12000 : Wh-what? And you didn't suffer any brain damage or other ill effects?
12001 : Then count yourself as one of the lucky ones.
12002 : You see, this little box here harbors a combination of imprinting technology and geomantic incantations...and caused quite the disturbance the last time someone used it.
12003 : Runic flux and ergon energy are a powder keg waiting to happen.
12004 : Too much ergon, and...kaboom!
12005 : Well, not literally. But the user can see replicated images of their past, or suffer massive head trauma due to the uncontrollable surge of memories flooding it.
12006 : And in the worst cases, they can pick up the memories of others, or even rip a hole in space-time and find themselves sucked in.
12007 : Surely I don't have to spell out what that means.
12008 : It was last used several years back and--Goddess be thanked--no ill came of it.
12009 : But if it were to happen again, we'd have to start the design process over from scratch.
12010 : See this little stamp on the back? That means it was made recently, so I can repair it free of charge.
12011 : Here you go. The repairs've made it a bit safer, so why don't you take a quick peek?
12012 : I'm...here...

12030 : I don't know which is more astounding--the superb lessons in gathering techniques we offer to pioneers or the contributions you can make to the colonization movement after you've finished them!
12031 : Want some equipment to help you protect the town like a true Peacekeepers' Coalition member?
12032 : I don't mind parting with some of this Peacekeepers' Coalition equipment as long as it's for a good cause.

12044 : Care to peek through some of the Celennia Memorial Library's tomes? It always pays to be well-informed.
12045 : Ugtoor of the Inventors' Coalition, at your service. I provide...goods of the guild, so to speak.
12046 : Got bayld? Then I'd be happy to hand over some of the finest Inventors' Coalition creations you'll ever see!
12047 : I am more than willing to supply you with a diverse selection of Inventors' Coalition sundries, but only if you possess an adequate amount of bayld.
12048 : You too can have some of the Inventors' Coalition's highly coveted ergon tinctures in exchange for a tiny pinch of bayld!
12049 : You already know of the ergon loci--locations from which inexplicable powers emanate--don't you?
12050 : While we may have yet to fully understand them, we have succeeded in bottling their essence! As a nod to this elixir's source, we call it ergon tincture.
12051 : Visitaru me any time you'd like to use my arcane glyptic power-wowers to augment your Traditional Armor...if you've got some coalition grease laying around.
12052 : What're arcane glyptics? They closely resemble what you Middle Landers call augments, but there are some slight differences.
12053 : Bayld or obsidian fragments for special arcane glyptics here, plain and simple-wimple. What isn't so simple, though, is that I'm only interestaru'd in weaponry from worlds beyond our own. Also, I'm particular-wicularly fond of ghastly stones.
12054 : Do you wish to have the equipment you wrested from the clutches of the continent's menaces bestowed with certain arcane glyptics? If not, your soul will forever be consumed with regret.
12055 : Take what you want and get out of my face...but not before paying with some obsidian fragments.
12056 : Obsidian fragments are rare things. You can only get them by pioneering.
12057 : Their most obvious use is for redeeming things, but we're trying to research new uses for them. Now hurry up and get your shopping done.
12058 : <Sigh> We've been ordered to accept your old % in exchange for %.
12059 : I have to give you # ) for every # ).
12060 : A very simple process. As I like to say, Wham, bam, and now scram.
12061 : We've also started some nonsense about trading stones for obsidian fragments.
12062 : I would say I'm pleased to tell you the exchange rate for [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/mummers' medals], but I'm really not.
12063 : Obsidian fragment exchange rate: # fragment[/s] for # ). # fragment[/s] for # ). # fragment[/s] for # ).

12066 : Trade # )? No thanks. Trade for # [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/mummers' medals]. Exchange for # %.

12073 : Got more mweya plasm than you know what to do with? Trade it in for some of my finestaru goods!
12074 : Mweya plasm corpuscles are crystallizations of an enigmatic substance that can only be obtained by colonizing the Ulbukan jungle-wungle.

12114 : We conduct censuses from time to time on what spoils Adoulin's pioneers have procured from their victories, and then make that information public via lottery.
12115 : Now, when I talk about spoils, I mean strictly ones obtained in battle. Not goods that you can't show off to your loved ones back home.
12116 : I'd also like to clarify that what individuals receive and what gets split amongst party members are all presented in the same report. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it is what it is.
12117 : For the sake of coalition members' sanity, we recount what spoils have been attained after every # battle[/s], but do not report the numbers of specific treasures.
12118 : Now it's time to talk compensation. We can't run about at the beck and call of all you pioneers losing our marbles for free, you know. All we ask for in return is a small token of appreciation...in the form of # bayld.
12119 : Inquire about what? (Bayld: #) Nothing. Skirmishes. Delve.
12120 : Which [/Skirmish/Delve] area? (Bayld: #) Nowhere. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12121 : Which [/Skirmish/Delve] rank? (Bayld: #) None. %[/ I/ I/ I]. %[/ II/ II/ II]. %[/ III/ III/ III]. %[/ IV/ IV/ IV]. %[/ V/ V/ V]. %[// Fracture/ Sealed Domain].
12122 : View which? ([/S./D.]: %[ I/ II/ III/ IV/ V/ Fracture/ S. Domain] I'd rather try my luck at the raffle. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. This isn't relevant to my interests.
12123 : Reward: %.
12124 : Try your chances again for # bayld?
12125 : Try your chances again? (Bayld: #) You bet! It's too risky for my tastes.
12126 : How experienced are you? ([Bayld/Gil]: #) Not enough to play. A pigeon. (# [Bayld/Gil]) A honeymooner. (# [Bayld/Gil]) A shill. (# [Bayld/Gil]) A premium player. (# [Bayld/Gil]) A shark. (# [Bayld/Gil])
12127 : You're on a hot streak and winning will now give you #.# times as many medals!
12128 : You've obtained # mummers' medal[/s].
12129 : Try again? [ /(You're on a hot streak!)] Nope. Yes, with # bayld. (Bayld: #) Yes, with # gil. (Gil: #)
12130 : End the amusement? No, I can't quit now! Yes, I've had enough.
12131 : What will you do? Abstain from playing. Play using bayld. (Bayld: #) Play using gil. (Gil: #) Nothing until I hear an explanation!
12132 : Fancy yourself an accomplished lockpicker? Then test your skills by deciphering combinations within the set amount of tries and make all the [ladies/gents] swoon!
12133 : All locks have two digits, which you'll have to deduce by remembering the numbers you've guessed. A little intuition gained from examining them never hurt, either.
12134 : Which item will you obtain? None of them. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12135 : Which temporary item will you obtain? None of them. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12136 : Obtain this item? Yes. No.
12137 : Obtain this temporary item? Yes. No.
12138 : % obtains %!
12139 : You were unable to obtain the item.
12140 : % obtains the temporary item: %!
12141 : You already possess that temporary item.
12142 : The chest is locked.
12143 : What will you do? Leave it be. Attempt to unlock it.
12144 : What will you do? (# chances remaining.) Give up. Enter a combination. Examine the lock.
12145 : It appears that you can enter a two-digit combination between 10 and 99.
12146 : You were unable to enter a combination.
12147 : You have a hunch that the lock's combination is [greater/less] than #.
12148 : % failed to open the lock.
12149 : It appears that the correct combination was #.
12150 : % succeeded in opening the lock!
12151 : You have a hunch that the second digit is [even/odd].
12152 : You have a hunch that the first digit is [even/odd].
12153 : You have a hunch that the combination is greater than # and less than #.
12154 : You have a hunch that the combination is less than #.
12155 : You have a hunch that the combination is greater than #.
12156 : You have a hunch that one of the two digits is #.
12157 : You have a hunch that the second digit is #, #, or #.
12158 : You have a hunch that the first digit is #, #, or #.
12159 : You were unable to glean anything from your examination of the lock.
12160 : Obtain this item?
12161 : The monster was concealing a treasure chest!
12169 : # # # # # # # #
12170 : What will you do? (# chance[/s] remaining.) Enter a combination. Examine the lock. Give up.
12171 : It appears that you can enter a two-digit combination between # and #.
12172 : If you enjoy tossing dice every so often, this may just be the challenge you have been searching for. Who shall reach 11 with a few flicks of the wrist first--you or me?
12173 : Either you or I may choose to shoot and roll the dice, stay and do nothing, or pick from three tricks up your sleeve.
12174 : The three tricks in your arsenal of deception include Sneak Peek, which allows you to see your opponent's shots, using the old Switcheroo and trading shots with your opponent, or forcing your opponent to reroll a shot of his choice with Crooked Die.
12175 : These three tricks will spin the wheel of fortune in your favor, but it is precisely because of their immense powers that we must limit their use to once per game.
12176 : Make sure you attempt to turn the tables at the right time, or Lady Luck will be the one cleaning house.
12177 : You shot a #, for a total of # on turn number #.
12179 : It is now turn number # for [you/your opponent].
12180 : [You/Your opponent] [shot/stayed].
12181 : What will you do? Shoot. Stay. Use a trick up my sleeve. Fold.
12182 : Which trick will you use? None, I've changed my mind. Sneak Peek. Switcheroo. Crooked Die.
12183 : Look at which shot? ([Sneak Peek/Switcheroo/Reroll]) None, I've changed my mind. Shot one. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot two. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot three. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot four. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot five. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot six. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot seven. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot eight. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot nine. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot ten. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6] Shot eleven. [???/1/2/3/4/5/6]
12184 : You snuck a peek at one of your opponent's dice! Shot number # was a # for him.
12185 : You used the old switcheroo! Your # has been exchanged with your opponent's #, and your total is now #.
12186 : You forced your opponent to shoot again! His shot for turn number # is now #.
12187 : Choose [your opponent's/your] die and [peek at it/exchange it/make him shoot again].
12188 : Your opponent's total: #[/ (Bust!)] Your total: #[/ (Bust!)] [You win, and thus have the right to gloat all you want until your rematch./Don't go throwing your dice just because you lost, all right?/You are equally matched, and have drawn.]
12189 : Clear your mind and ready your chronological senses, for this amusement pits you against time's dilatory creep. The objective here's to speak to me a certain amount of times at the intervals I tell you.
12190 : Just so you know, I'll only give you the length of time to wait and how far off you were from the specified interval when spoken to. Furthermore, the difference between your guess and the answer is cumulative.
12191 : If you're too slow one round, you can make up time by being a little fast the next.
12192 : Finally, you claim victory by staying within a certain number of seconds by the end of the final round. I hope this cleared things up, and enjoy honing your mastery over Father Time.
12193 : I take it that means you're in the correct state of mind to challenge the forces of time. Let's do this!
12194 : Countdown initiated! Your target time for round number # is # seconds.
12195 : You were off by...# second[/s]. Your target interval for round number # is # second[/s].
12196 : It's judgment time! You were [a total of /a total of /]# second[/s] [early./late./off. In other words, perfectly on-target!] [It seems that the concept of time eludes you./Congratulations, you've temporarily mastered the forces of time!]
12197 : A wet and wild adventure, this. You and I take turns filling a goblet with water until the cup runneth over, with the offending competitor sent to drown in shame.
12198 : The rub is that it looks as if there is more water in the goblet than actually exists. Thus you will need to exercise the entirety of your patience and perspicacity to wrench victory from my clutches.
12199 : As if that were not enough, I have added an extra layer of frustration by granting us competitors certain abilities dubbed afflictions and remedies.
12200 : On the one hand, afflictions allow you to do such things as change the amount of water I see.
12201 : You can also use them to negate the effects of my remedies or limit the amount of water I can pour.
12202 : On the other hand, remedies help increase or decrease either the amount of the water you can pour or the amount of water in the goblet. As a final twist, they can also negate the effects of afflictions.
12203 : Afflictions and remedies cause the tides of competition to surge and swell to an extreme degree, so we restrict their use to once per game. Be prudent with which you use and when.
12204 : What will you do? Pour away! Use an affliction. Use a remedy. Throw in the towel.
12205 : How will you afflict your opponent? I won't, that's how. Increase amount poured. Decrease amount poured. Fabricate water level. Remove a remedy. Restrict to greater pouring options. Restrict to lesser pouring options.
12206 : What remedy will you use? None, that's what! Increase amount poured. Decrease amount poured. Cure an affliction. Increase maximum water level. Decrease maximum water level.
12207 : Pour how much? (Currently # onz[/es].) One onz. Two onzes. Three onzes. Four onzes. Five onzes.
12208 : [You used an affliction on Etienne./You used a remedy on yourself./You cured an affliction.]
12209 : [You/Etienne] poured water into the goblet. There [is/are] currently # onz[/es] of water in it.
12210 : [You/Etienne] poured water into the goblet, causing it to overflow. [You have bested your challenger. Claim what is yours by lapping the tears of defeat from his face and tasting the glorious sorrow contained within./How does complete and utter defeat feel? Will you even be able to sleep once night falls?]
12211 : Should you seek salvation by enhancing your equipment through arcane glyptics, simply bequeath the requisite materials and equipment to me and I shall work my magic.
12212 : No ordinary beings can perform the feats I accomplish even before breakfast, so there will of course be a slight charge for my services...# bayld, to be exact.
12213 : Even pioneers like you seeking refuge in amusements can't escape the time's inevitable ticking. The last time you played this game, you were disqualified for exceeding the time limit.
12214 : Your enthusiasm is much appreciated, but please finish the game you are currently playing before beginning a new one.
12215 : I've grrraciously marked your %.
12216 : There's nothing to marrrk on this map.

12231 : %.
12232 : What shall you do? (Bayld: #) Not a thing. Mezzotint equipment. Check materials required. Inquire about arcane glyptics.
12233 : Arcane glyptics are truly astounding engravings--they can be used to enhance a cornucopia of equipment you find during your pioneering journeys! However, they cannot work their magic until the article in question undergoes a priming process called mezzotinting.
12234 : There are three glyptic paths down which you may send your equipment. All of them differ in significant ways and will not fail to treat your beloved accouterments right.
12235 : Moreover, your inanimate comrades in combat can be further enhanced by employing materials such as % during glyptic engraving.
12236 : I must warn you, however, that the process is not instantaneous. We will need to engrave your articles multiple times before any glyptics take effect.
12237 : Think of it like your pioneering activities. Ulbuka cannot be colonized in a day, nor can we improve your equipment in one try if we want to do a satisfactory job. In addition, your equipment may undergo mezzotinting any time you wish to set it down a new path to clearing the continent of danger. Simply ask and you shall receive.
12238 : Lest I forget, I should also mention that a fee of # bayld is required for the first mezzotinting, while # is the price for subsequent ones and enhancement via materials.
12239 : Your % has already been engraved with an arcane glyptic, the benefits of which will be lost upon mezzotinting. Do you still wish to proceed?
12240 : Proceed with mezzotinting? Yes, scrape all the excess benefits away! No, I love my little precious too much!
12241 : Which type of glyptics shall you engrave?
12242 : Which type do you want engraved? None. Arcane Glyptic Type A. Arcane Glyptic Type B. Arcane Glyptic Type C.
12243 : Do you wish to mezzotint your weapon so that it is primed to receive the aforementioned attribute enhancements?
12244 : Your % has successfully undergone mezzotinting.
12245 : Here is your %.
12246 : As much as I would like to, I cannot engrave any arcane glyptics upon your %. My condolences.
12247 : What area is your equipment from? Nowhere, now begone. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12248 : This % looks as if it can be engraved with a peculiar sort of arcane glyptic. It may behoove you to show this to the person in charge of such procedures.
12249 : Take a gander at what? Nothing. Equipment. Materials.
12250 : Arcane glyptics can only do so much, and it seems your % has reached that limit.
12251 : I do not believe your % has undergone the mezzotinting process as of yet. If that is the case, I am only able to accept that piece of equipment for now, and hereby return the other item to you.
12252 : How many do you wish to receive? None. #. #. #. #. #. #. #. #. #. #. #. #.
12253 : You wish to purchase # )? Then I shall require # [fragment/mweya plasm corpuscle/medal/bayld clump][/s].
12254 : Itching to know about either frontier bivouacs' construction status or durability? Then you have come to the right person, [sir/ma'am].
12255 : View for which area? None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
12256 : Which bivouac? (%) None. F. Bivouac #1. (#% constructed) F. Bivouac #2. (#% constructed) F. Bivouac #3. (#% constructed) F. Bivouac #4. (#% constructed) F. Bivouac #5. (#% constructed)
12257 : Frontier Bivouac[/ #1/ #2/ #3/ #4/ #5] is currently at # percent durability. [It's in dire need of immediate frontline support!/I highly suggest providing frontline support to it in the near future./You might want to think about providing frontline support to it eventually./It seems relatively sturdy./It's still sturdy enough that you have nothing to worry about.]
12258 : Construction on Frontier Bivouac[/ #1/ #2/ #3/ #4/ #5] is # percent complete. In other words, [it hasn't even started/it's just begun/it's gathering steam/it's progressing splendidly/it's progressed to a great degree/it's come exceptionally far].
12259 : For a tiny bit of bayld or a smidgen of obsidian fragments, I can transmutaru your equipment or engrave it with arcane glyptic-wyptics.
12260 : What will you do? ([Bayld/Obs. Frag./Mweya Plasm]: #) Nothing. [Proceed with the exchange/Learn about augmentation/Proceed with the exchange/Proceed with the exchange]. [/Check augmentable equipment//]. [/Check arcane glyptic materials//]. Ask about [ergon tinctures/arcane glyptics/obsidian fragments/mweya plasm]. [/Learn about transmuting equipment//]. [/Check transmutable equipment//]. [/Check transmutation materials//]. Learn about [/transmutation in general/stone exchange services/]. [/Ask about stored materials/]. [/Have stored materials returned/].
12261 : If you ever-wever want to transmute equipment, just trade me the appropriataru piece and nothing more while in possession of %.
12262 : Now, I'm an honestaru businessman. I'll tell you in advance that I require a fee of # bayld for my service.
12263 : Transmutation is a process resembling-wembling the synthesis of high-quality equipment.
12264 : The process is shrouded-wouded in mystery, and we aren't about to give away our secrets. I will, however, impartaru to you that we employ % to work our magic.
12265 : As a note of warning, transmuting equipment rubs out any arcane glyptics you have currentaruly engraved. Sorry, but dem's da breaks.
12266 : The following must be procured to engrave arcane glyptics on %.
12267 : The following must be procured to transmute %.
12268 : %.
12269 : I will need-weed # bayld to transmute this %.
12270 : Begin your journey down the wonderful road of transmutation-wation!
12271 : What shall you do? Check current attributes. Check post-transmutation attributes. Transmute the equipment. Nothing.
12272 : Transmute the piece of equipment? Yes. No.
12273 : End transmutation? Yes. No.
12274 : Just so you know, I don't transmutaru anything for people who aren't in possession of either % or %.
12275 : If you do have one, though, you need only trade-wade me the equipmentaru in question.
12276 : The whole process-wocess is easier than making trail cookies! We take % or % and...
12277 : ...Use our magical inventors' powers to transmute the articles you give us! What, you thoughtaru we'd just give away our closely guarded secret to possible competition?
12278 : Your % now has # reinforcement point[/s].
12279 : I know your type. You're one of those pioneer-wioneers who likes to try [his/her] luck. Well, then, there is no more appropriataru game for you in all of Adoulin than the oft-lauded Box...of...Fortune!
12280 : What makes this game so greataru is that it requires not a lick of skill whatsoever.
12281 : An egalitarian-warian roll of the dice determines which of the # treasure chests you'll open. Depending on the trove inside, you'll get somewhere between a handful and a mountain of mummers' medals.
12282 : The three types of ticketarus to wealth that dwell inside chests are: crystals such as %, spirits like %, and jewels the likes of %.
12283 : Crystals are the condensed-wensed form of # medal[/s], spirits scare # medal[/s] into your clutches, and jewels glintaru with the power of # medal[/s].
12284 : What's more, unboxing a jewel immediataruly puts you on a hot streak more scorching-worching than the fires of Moh Gates.
12285 : Once you're on a hot streak, you have a high chance of revealing more jewels, but all good things must come to an end. Should either a crystal or spirit pop out from a chestaru, your flames get doused.
12286 : Now, you're free to stop playing anytime you wish, but I wouldn't recommend doing it while you're on a hot streak. It would mean snuffing-wuffing out your streak faster than a chapuli's horn can slice through your legs.
12287 : No funny stuff here, just a plain-wain roll of the dice.
12288 : The chest opens to reveal %! You win # mummers' medal[/s]!
12289 : Welcome to the wonderful arena that is Three-Card Circus. I, Olivaine, will be your ringmistress.
12290 : To win this greatest amusement on Vana'diel, you must collect suit and number combinations of the three cards you are dealt. Each card will be imprinted with one of four suits and six numbers.
12291 : It is possible to trade in a maximum of three times, and the amount of cards you draw is equal to the number you discard. Of course, it is acceptable to step down from exchanging should you feel you are walking on a tightrope.
12292 : As for the combinations, each one is worth a different number of points. In the event that all three of your cards display different numbers, only the largest one shall count toward your point total.
12293 : If you possess a pair, you gain a number of points equal to twice the number of your remaining card.
12294 : Furthermore, should you have three of a kind, you will receive fifty points regardless of the cards' number.
12295 : Additionally, having cards of all the same suit gives you points equal to twice the total of the numbers on the cards in your hand.
12296 : Lastly, should the numbers on your cards total eleven, you will receive three times the amount of points.
12297 : [Your/Olivaine's] hand consists of: A [//]#, a [//]#, and a [//]#.
12298 : What will you do? View your hand. Trade in. View discard pile. Listen to an explanation. Stop trading.
12299 : The following cards have been discarded. Go back. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#. [//]#.
12300 : This card has already been dealt.
12301 : Trade in which one? None. [//]#. ([Hold/Trade]) [//]#. ([Hold/Trade]) [//]#. ([Hold/Trade]) Confirm trade.
12302 : [You have/Olivaine has] chosen not to trade in.
12303 : [You/Olivaine] discard[/s] a [//]# and draw[/s] # card[/s]!
12304 : [You/Olivaine] discard[/s] a [//]# and a [//]#, then draw[/s] # card[/s]!
12305 : [You/Olivaine] discard[/s] a [//]#, a [//]#, and a [//]#, then draw[/s] # card[/s]!
12306 : It is time for us to reveal our hands. <Drum Roll>
12307 : You have # point[/s], while Olivaine has # point[/s]. [You win, making you the leading act!/Olivaine has thoroughly tamed you with her victory./It's a tie! Time to jump through another ring of fire.]
12308 : I'm also now offering obsidian fragmentarus for another type of stone with a weird name.
12309 : There's a veritable cornucopia-wopia of arcane glyptics I can engrave upon your %, but their effects tend to differ depending on the materials used.
12310 : Got # obsidian fragment[/s] on your hands? Then I can engrave your % with some astounding arcane glyptic-wyptics!
12311 : Ah, but certain pieces of equipmentaru will require a little more tender loving care...along with # obsidian fragment[/s] to compensate.
12312 : Have you ever feltaru that those special stones from skirmishes you've been lugging around in your bags have been cramping your style? Well, you're in luck! I've started-warted a storage service to meet the needs of the times.
12313 : So you want me to hold some % for you? Let me have a look... This makes for a total of # I have stored for you.
12314 : Unfortunataruly, my boxes are already crammed full, and I can't store any more % for you.
12315 : I'll happily store skirmish stones for you. Just trade-wade them to me one type at a time.
12316 : I'm able to save up the following material-werials.
12317 : You've currently entrustarued me with the following items.
12318 : Have which item returned? None of the above. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Previous page. Next page.
12319 : My records indicataru that I'm holding # of that type for you. How many would you like?
12320 : #? I'll get them for you right away.
12321 : Not interested-winterested? Never fear, I'll still be here should you require me to return them.

12347 : How many? (# [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/Mummers' medals]) Exchange. (# [obsidian fragments/mweya plasm corpuscles/Mummers' medals] needed) Let me think some more.
12348 : Excuse me, but I do not believe you have %, do you?
12349 : Oh, that's too bad, because we would love for you to help us with the colonization effort. If you are willing, then by all means, speak with Brenton so he can outfit you with one.
12350 : My name is  and it is my duty to make sure all pioneers are properly prepared to face the many terrifying dangers that wait in the wilds. May I inquire as to your needs?
12351 : What do you need? Would you cast Ionis on me? Can you tell me Ionis's effects? What exactly is Ionis? Absolutely nothing.
12352 : It pains me to report that I cannot cast Ionis upon you because none of the coalitions are advanced enough to impart any powers upon it.
12353 : In order to bestow Ionis upon you, I will need to exact a fee of # bayld.
12354 : You know what they say--all things have their price. What say you?
12355 : Truly have Ionis cast? (Bayld: #) Cast away! Not so fast.
12356 : Thank you for your #-bayld donation to the city. And now, let us proceed with the casting!
12357 : Um...how embarrassing... How should I say this...? You do not seem to possess ample bayld.
12358 : To each [his/her] own, I suppose. Is there anything else you require?
12359 : The power Ionis bestows fluctuates depending on how advanced each coalition is.
12360 : Select a coalition. None. Pioneers'. Peacekeepers'. Couriers'. Scouts'. Inventors'. Mummers'.
12361 : Here is how the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition contributes to Ionis.
12362 : Whoops, it seems they do not add any additional effects.
12363 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Attack Enhancement/Minor Magic Attack Bonus/Minor Gathering Fatigue Reduction/Minor Gathering Efficacy Enhancement/Moderate Attack Enhancement/Moderate Magic Attack Bonus/Moderate Gathering Fatigue Reduction/Moderate Gathering Efficacy Enhancement] will be bestowed upon you.
12364 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Defense Enhancement/Minor Magic Defense Bonus/Minor HP and MP Recovery Enhancement/Minor Enhancement to Max HP and MP/Moderate Defense Enhancement/Moderate Magic Defense Bonus/Moderate HP and MP Recovery Enhancement/Moderate Enhancement to Max HP and MP] will be bestowed upon you.
12365 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Accuracy and Magic Accuracy Enhancement/Minor Evasion and Magic Evasion Enhancement/Minor Critical Hit Rate Increase/Minor Haste Effect/Moderate Accuracy and Magic Accuracy Enhancement/Moderate Evasion and Magic Evasion Enhancement/Moderate Critical Hit Rate Increase/Moderate Haste Effect] will be bestowed upon you.
12366 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Save TP Effect/Minor Conserve MP Effect/Minor Fast Cast Effect/Minor Resistance Increase to All Status Ailments/Moderate Save TP Effect/Moderate Conserve MP Effect/Moderate Fast Cast Effect/Moderate Resistance Increase to All Status Ailments] will be bestowed upon you.
12367 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Crystal Obtainment Rate Increase/Minor Material Loss Rate Reduction/Minor Synthesis Skill Gain Rate Increase/Minor Synthesis Success Rate Increase/Moderate Crystal Obtainment Rate Increase/Moderate Material Loss Rate Reduction/Moderate Synthesis Skill Gain Rate Increase/Moderate Synthesis Success Rate Increase] will be bestowed upon you.
12368 : Based on the state of their expansion, a [Minor Combat Skill Gain Rate Increase/Minor Magic Skill Gain Rate Increase/Minor Experience Point Bonus/Minor Reward Obtainment Rate Increase/Moderate Combat Skill Gain Rate Increase/Moderate Magic Skill Gain Rate Increase/Moderate Experience Point Bonus/Moderate Reward Obtainment Rate Increase] will be bestowed upon you.
12369 : What a tricky question. Well...it is a thaumaturgical aura that grants multitudes of benefits to pioneers.
12370 : What is truly interesting is that this aura draws its powers from the various coalitions. The larger they grow, the more powerful the benefits each one will provide.
12371 : The more pioneering feats you perform, the more the coalitions develop, and the more beneficial Ionis becomes. Think of it as a virtuous cycle!
12372 : You have been imbued with the power of Ionis!
12373 : W-w-wait!!! <Huff> <Puff> My...my name's Sylvie. Pleased to...to make your acquaintance, hee hee!
12374 : <Huff> ...Sorry, I'm an out-of-shape geomancer...and not a people person.
12375 : But Ikhi Askamot herself has charged me with this most splendiferous of responsibilities to help me overcome my shortcomings!
12376 : Ahhhhhh, uhhh, my task? Well, um, it's to help bring new geomancers into the fold. Yaaaaaay!
12377 : To tell the truth, the Order of Renaye is...kind of opposed to this whole pioneering thingamajig.
12378 : But! But! If Adoulin needs our assistance, we're gonna do everything we can!
12379 : Plus, Eastern Ulbuka's scenery scares me with its trees and rivers--without geomancers to lend their aid, what hope does the land have?
12380 : And you...you look like the geodancing type! Right? Right!?
12381 : Your move. Wha...? Slow down, Nellie.
12382 : I...yes, well...geomancers! You wanna be one, don'tcha?
12383 : ...Sorry. I'm not terribly good at this sort of thing.
12384 : Try your hand at geomancy? I'd love to give it a go! Sounds like fun!
12385 : R-really!? Oh, how magnanitabular!
12386 : You're really sure? I mean really, really sure???
12387 : Hooray! Then let's roll up our sleeves and get started!
12388 : First, a quiz! What's Adoulin's oldest profession? That's right...geomancy!
12389 : But, well, even though it was known for, well, since forever, it never really took off until much later.
12390 : I'm a little fuzzy on the details. It's complicated. Something about the sirens of legends, or the five disciples of Sih Renaye... Gosh, I can never keep this stuff straight.
12391 : Oh, wait! Geomancy. Right.
12392 : Research into geomancy as a discipline started...well, started in Eastern Ulbuka as a way to counteract the dangers of nature, and took place over many, many years.
12393 : It's kinda similar to, yet totally different from, the pioneering efforts that occurred back then. What geomancy cares about is having a heart-to-heart with nature.
12394 : But that's at a really advanced level. Back then, only the best of the best could do it.
12395 : Well, you know...natural forces can be a bit cheeky, and don't like it when people try to expose their feelings.
12396 : Eventually, the ancient geomancers realized that the answer wasn't to control the land--could you imagine?--but rather let themselves be swept up by its current and borrow some of its strength.
12397 : We call that current the lifestream. The lifestream flows within Mother Nature kinda like how blood flows through you and me. It's all around us, even right now.
12398 : When we use the power of the lifestream, it's called using Geomantic Incantations, or simply Geomancy. Confusing, right? I know it threw me for a loop, having two words mean the same thing...
12399 : There are two types of geomancy. Power originating from the geomancer herself is known as Indi, and power originating from a mystic emanation known as a luopan is called Geo.
12400 : Ikhi Askamot says that ancient geomancers gave names to all these terms to help people understand, but she also thinks that it's easier to just see for yourself.
12401 : It's like that old saying, you know? A picture is worth two in the bush, or something...? Sorry, I'm really bad at this.
12402 : Come on, you know what I mean! If you get your hands wet you'll learn more than if I blab on about it for hours.
12403 : S-so! In order to handle the excellentatiousness of geomancy, you first need a luopan!
12404 : Luopans are essential for being a world-class geomancer. They're like a loyal pet--until death do you part!
12405 : Except luopans don't run away one afternoon when you're seven years old, leaving you crying on your front doorstep.
12406 : 'Course, most geomancers can't use luopans right after they become one. Become geomancers, I mean.
12407 : Lecture's over! Ready to get down and dirty?
12408 : Make a luopan? Yes! .........No.
12409 : Wh-what? I've been sitting here pouring my heart out, and you're gonna walk away just like that?
12410 : I knew I wasn't cut out for this... Oh, Ikhi, I did it again...
12411 : You...really mean it? You're going to try?
12412 : This is stupendelicious!
12413 : Let's get this party started before you bail on me!
12414 : Getting the materials for a luopan is really simple, so I know you'll be up for it.
12415 : You'll need two things--one % and %.
12416 : The luopan is a medium for you to get all friendly with nature. That's why you need the %.
12417 : You're from the Middle Lands, not Adoulin, so to make a really super-duper one, you should find some from an area in your homeland where energies flow through the soil.
12418 : That's all you need! Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. Just come back to me when you've got 'em!
12419 : Came back for a reminder on what you need for your luopan?
12420 : Right, all you needed was the perfect combination of % and %!
12421 : All right, let me have at 'em!
12422 : <Gulp>...
12423 : A-ack!!!
12424 : <Heave> And... <Cough> Oh no, I... Phew!
12425 : <Grunt>
12426 : Oh, ugly umbrils! I almost had a heart attack!
12427 : Sorry about that. Here's your fresh, shiny luopan!
12428 : Yes, fresh and shiny...but not yet done!
12429 : It's gotta go to an ergon locus first.
12430 : It is only in these places, deeply connected with nature herself, that your luopan will be able to display its...<whisper> immense power.
12431 : Ah! Ergon locus, right. It's like I told you--places filled with natural power.
12432 : Though they exist through all of Vana'diel, here in Adoulin we call them ergon loci.
12433 : You came into contact with them in the Middle Lands, I'm sure. Depending on the era and locale, some of them go by different names...I guess.
12434 : One of the fruits--low-hanging fruit, perhaps--of this pioneering whosy-whatsit is that we've discovered ergon loci in the Yahse Hunting Grounds and the Ceizak Battlegrounds.
12435 : I gotta be honest with you. As a geomancer, I'm not a big fan of messing with nature.
12436 : But sometimes you gotta take a long-term view, y'know?
12437 : This whole tug-of-war between nature and progress has always defined what Adoulin is.
12438 : Tohoho, listen to me! That was totally deep, right?
12439 : ...Where were we? Oh, right, ergon loci. Bring your luopan to one of these loci and remain calm and steady.
12440 : Like this, see?
12441 : You gotta be focused, or else it won't work. It's the first step in becoming one with nature. Let the lifestream gently flow into your luopan.
12442 : You'll get all hot and bothered, so you'll know when it's happening. This is another one of those two in the bush things.
12443 : And just when you think you've had all you can stand and are about to explode...you'll finish and feel the warm embrace of release.
12444 : I'll have to touch up your luopan when you're done, so make sure to come back!
12445 : You know...the forest isn't the friendliest of locations. I'd hate for anything to happen to your precious luo--<cough> to you.
12446 : There you have it! Now get going!
12447 : This is positively momenterrific! Let me get a good look...
12448 : ...There! I applied a thin astral patina to your luopan to keep it in tip-top shape. Now you can use it in your geomantic adventures!
12449 : You know, Ikhi said that this luopan business was brought to Adoulin ten-something years ago by a woman from abroad. Quite the convenience, wouldn't you say?
12450 : <Whisper> She also said that same woman taught us about the waypoints. <Cough> I don't know much more about it.
12451 : ...Sorry! I was rambling again, wasn't I?
12452 : Anyway, you can't actually use your luopan to its full extent unless you become more experienced in geomancy.
12453 : Aww, look at you with those sad eyes. Fear not! It won't be long before you've mastered both parts of geomancy!
12454 : Don't tell me you forgot what they are already! ...Fine, let's review. Indi spells are energy centered around the geomancer, while Geo spells are energy centered around the luopan.
12455 : It's probably easier if I just show you.
12456 : This is Indi...
12457 : ...And this is Geo.
12458 : Those more experienced with the ways of the geomancer get to use both at once! Not a bad deal, if you ask me. As an aside, the fields created by Indi and Geo are collectively known as Colures.
12459 : When we use the terms Indi and Geo, we are simply using the short form of Indicolures and Geocolures.
12460 : This is probably a lot to take in. Don't lose heart, though--you'll be a magnifferific geomancer before you know it!
12461 : And now, by the powers vested in me, I declare you geomancer and luopan.
12462 : Ah, wait! All this time, and I never even asked your name!
12463 : %, it was a pleasure working with you!
12464 : With all you've done to get this far, you must be itching for some kind of prize. Normally the luopan itself would be enough, but you've been such a good sport that I got you a little gift.
12465 : This is called a geomantic handbell. With it, you can bring out the true strength of your geomancy spells. Just don't forget to equip it and leave it in your back pocket like the last initiate, hmm?
12466 : And another present for you. This % is your first official weapon in your geomantic arsenal. Make sure you use it wisely!
12467 : Thanks for putting up with a ditzy klutz like me all this time!
12468 : Maybe one day you'll become as fantabulacious of a geomancer as I am!
12469 : You what!? Who goes around throwing away a perfectly good handbell!?
12470 : I thought I'd made it perfectly clear how it was almost as important as your luopan...
12471 : Fine, fine. I'll let you have another handbell--but because it was your fault, you get to shoe the bill.
12472 : I accept payment in the form of either # gil or # bayld.
12473 : So? How is this transaction gonna go down?
12474 : Select your payment method. Hang on. Gil. Bayld.
12475 : Are you reeeally sure? No true geomancer would ever go without their bell!
12476 : Let's seal the deal, then.
12477 : Here's your new handbell. Please keep better track of this one, okay?
12478 : Hmm...you don't seem to have enough. I can't let you have a new one just because you have a pretty face.
12479 : Umm, hmmm.... I don't think this [guy/gal] can do it...
12480 : What's this then? You can't carry any more? Lemme know when you've get everything sorted out, and we'll do this again!
12481 : You hand the clerk the % and # gil, and your set of armor is returned.
12482 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. Have you ever found yourself throwing away items because your Mog Safe is overflowing with dusty sets of armor collected on your many adventures? My colleagues and I have heard the cries of our fellow adventurers and joined together to aid all those in need.
12483 : Trade me a full set, and for a small fee (payable on pickup) we will hold on to it, all the while protecting it from thieves, moths, and any/all acts of god and/or goddess.

12506 : If it's a smith you seek, the only one that comes to my mind is Yestin-Ovestin.
12507 : He never seems to accept work from anyone, so you can always find him waddling around the waterfront. The only thing you're apt to get from him is a wad of spit in the eye, but you never know.
12508 : Innovations that are fun for the whole family, safe and reliable services, and not a hint of blood money anywhere! That's the Inventors' Coalition in a nutshell.
12509 : Globules of slag and various bits of string lay strewn about haphazardly...
12510 : For the lastaru time, I don't give a damn about behemoth horn aphro...oh.
12511 : So you're the servantaru Octavien said he was going to send...
12512 : You need me to forgey-worge a blade for you, then?
12513 : Is that what you came here to ask? Yes, it is. No, it's not.
12514 : Then why the hell did you come here? Wait, don't answer that. Just make like a log and splitaru.
12515 : Well, tough troll teats.
12516 : The Order of Orvail wants a sword that is normally produced using techniques that died out centuries-wenturies ago. The ones in which we contemporary blacksmiths are versed are barely applicable.
12517 : If I add even the slightaruest bit too much or too little of certain ingredients after smelting, the blade will turn out duller than that intolerable geomancer Sylvie.
12518 : Sabers, broadswords, rapiers, they're all living, breathing things...and they all feed off their forgers' souls. Your attitudes and intentions when imbuing-wuing the steel are absorbed and determine its personality--for bettaru or worse.
12519 : Someone as adeptaru at smithing as me can bring this sword to life in exchange for shortening my own. The real problem, however, is getting the materials-werials together.
12520 : I have the requisitaru metals and leather, but for a weapon as mountainous-wountainous as this, you'll need to venture forth into the heart of Ulbuka's darkness to find some exceptionally powerful resources.
12521 : I don't have either % or %, but they're both indispensable-wensable.
12522 : I've heard you can find % in %, but I've certainly never been there. It's no stroll past the statue of the Goddess-woddess with your lover, and only those either blinded by fame and fortune or seeking the sweet reprieve of eternal slumber-wumber ever set out for it.
12523 : I may shape swords for a living, but I wouldn't be caughtaru dead swinging one. There's no way I'm going out there.
12524 : Go back to whatever Goddessforsaken continentaru you came from and forget about that sword.
12525 : Attached to the barrel is a note, written in a strong and decisive hand, that reads thus:
12526 : Don't ask me to make-wake anything right now. Go the hell away.                       --Yestin-Ovestin
12527 : By the Goddess almighty-wighty, th-this is...%! So, you were truly able to bestaru that apparition...
12528 : And you even managed to get ahold of %?
12529 : Inconceivable-weivable! It'd take millennia for the stars to align as they have for you! You must've used some sort of pioneer trickery.
12530 : Ah...Jerra. But if she was willing to partaru with it, that must mean...you're one of the elite who're engraved with the %.
12531 : I wouldn't want to disappointaru someone as devoted to swinging swords as I am to smithing them. Just let me gather-wather myself.
12532 : First, I must expunge all the conflictaruing thoughts from my mind.
12533 : ...There. I'm now in the correctaru state of mind to receive your % and %. Thank you.
12534 : Oho, I can feel the fire of the forge burning-wurning passionately within me once again!
12535 : A rhythmical clanking can be heard from within, mixed with the concentrated mumblings of a craftsman deep in thought.
12536 : Why'd you have to make this so heavy? I feel like it's going to rrrip my arms from their sockets!
12537 : I'll rrrip your arms off myself if you insultaru my masterpiece again!
12538 : [Sir/Madam] %, I've ordered the Couriers' Coalition to deliver the sword to Octavien postaru-haste.                               --Yestin-Ovestin
12539 : Oh, it's you. Give me a minutaru and I'll get that equipment Octavien ordered for--
12540 : That's not what I think-wink it is, is it!?
12541 : It is! Never in my wildestaru dreams did I ever think I'd get a chance to read the fabled-wabled %.
12542 : Gimme-wimme that.
12543 : <Mumble> Ahhh, I see... <Mumble> Of course! How could I be so stupid!?
12544 : Unbelievable... Applying these techniques to your equipmentaru will increase your defenses against any malady!
12545 : Sorry, but I'll need to alter my designs a bit. I can't in good conscience-wonscience give it to you like this.
12546 : There's no way I could live with myself if I gave this to you in its currentaru state. This calls for some alterations.
12547 : The telltale clack of a loom can be heard from within, mixed with the concentrated mumblings of a craftsman deep in thought.
12548 : How dare you make me make it from scrrratch again! I worked my tail off on it!
12549 : I won't ask a buffoon like you to understand, but a true artisan pays the utmost respectaru possible to every piece he makes.
12550 : And, finally... Here you go. What a mastarupiece it is, if I may say so myself.
12551 : What will you ask? Are you swimming in bayld? How have you been? How about that Adoulinian kelp? What wonderful weather we're having. Nothing.
12552 : I wouldn't say swimming, but I have enough to dip into every once in a while.
12553 : I've really got my work cut out for me with all the new types of arcane glyptics. I'm lucky if I get even two winks of sleep a night.
12554 : Yup.
12555 : Well, well, well. So you're the [guy/gal]. What is it you want to know about the incident two years ago?
12556 : What do you want to know? The trial objectives. Is that rune stone still here? Will I die today? Nothing. I've had enough.
12557 : You mean the one that recorded the events that day?
12558 : I can't imagine it's not, but I'll have to check. Just wait a second.
12559 : We've got ponzes upon ponzes of them strewn all over the shelves, so it's going to take some time to find the right one.
12560 : It didn't sound like there was that much to it. All you had to do was get ahold of %, which is used for dyeing clothing...
12561 : If you want, I can tell you how to get one.
12562 : First you have to procure % in %...
12563 : Then you tramp on over to % and set the whole river there to boiling.
12564 : Now, I'm no rune fencer, but I'm pretty sure Ignis would be the right rune to use if you had a grudge against chilly water.
12565 : Aw, damn me and my loose lips! Well, not much more I can do now that the cat's out of the bag...
12566 : I've been struck with a bout of lethargy of late, but if you were nice enough to bring me that dye, then the spring might come back into my step and I'd get to looking for that rune stone with you-know-what on it.
12567 : We need that dye to color some armor that came in, but we haven't had any in stock since the incident. No rune fencers want to go out and get any for us, which I understand.
12568 : Anyway, just think of it as collateral or quid pro quo or whatnot. Enjoy your jungle jaunt, now!
12569 : Could that be the % I asked you to get? I knew I could count on you.
12570 : As proof of my trust, I shook off my case of lethargy a bit early and found the rune stone you wanted.
12571 : Care to have a look?
12572 : Have at it, then. You'll have to view it here, though. No one's allowed to take this off the premises.
12573 : What's the matter? You look a little pale.
12574 : What do you think of my first attemptaru at forging a suit of armor? Isn't it magnificent?
12575 : Yeesh! If your goal is to blindy-wind your enemies with its gaudy gloss, then you've done a remarkable job.
12576 : Oh... I guess it is a bit much. It's not even fit for a pioneer's petaru, is it?
12577 : It, uh...looks really tough...and that shine does have a certain-wertain charm to it!
12578 : Well, I did make it for knightarus...
12579 : Still...damn, is that ever brightaru.
12580 : What do you care!? You only wear lightaru armor as a rune fencer anyway!
12581 : ...Taking another look, though, it's rather beautiful-weautiful. The Zurk approves wholeheartedly!
12582 : You don't have to go out of your way to praise-waise me like that.
12583 : ...Still, I appreciataru it. In return, have some candy.
12584 : You're wrrringing the most out of that steel... It started out as a soft chunk of slag, but now it's so bulbous and hard.
12585 : I'm an expurrrt at weaving cloth! My fingers never have trrrouble finding the seam.
12586 : Stop being inappropriataru and get to work!
12587 : Handed over key item: %.
12588 : Your % rings out across the land, somehow resonating with the % and causing it to evolve.
12589 : The % has reclaimed its lost power, and your % silently crumbles to dust.
12590 : The % is bestowed with an incredible amount of runic energy, causing it to take on a more puissant form.
12591 : The % has reached the pinnacle of its evolution.
12592 : Your % decomposes instantly and is carried by the winds to the ends of Vana'diel.
12593 : You feel an ever-so-faint sense that a rune with [frigid/bright/transient] properties lies nearby.
12594 : You scribbled down some information regarding %.
12595 : You have obtained new information regarding your %.
12596 : Strange visions flood into your mind!
12597 : Fragments of shattered memories wedge themselves into your skull.
12598 : Well, burn my brambles and call me a ghost town, if it ain't %. Did you hear about the official duel in the Rala Waterways?
12599 : Did you hear about it? You bet your britches. Come again?
12600 : Of course you did. Then I guess you done know the outcome already, eh?
12601 : Well, it's no skin off yer back, I guess. Personally, havin' outsiders learn about this unsav'ry custom of ours makes me redder'n a brandin' iron.
12602 : No matter the result, it's what they was fightin' 'bout that really gets the blood boilin'.
12603 : Ever since Grand Chancellor Ygnas reinstated colonization, those in favor and those against be squarin' off somethin' fierce. At each other's throats like rabid lapinions, I say.
12604 : This ain't the first incident, neither. With all the young'uns 'round here more ornery 'bout this topic than a Velkk with a toothache, it ain't hard to see why tensions be a-flarin'.
12605 : Have anything to say? How can I find out more? Is there anything in the library on this?
12606 : ...Well, I ain't much of no reader, but iff'n yer lookin' to turn a page or two about all the ill will between the two factions, the % is a good place to start.
12607 : Leapin' leafkin, %! I ain't know you done had % on you. You're bound and hog-tied to find somethin' in the % on this whole hullabaloo.
12608 : There's one title in partic'lar on the tip o' my tongue, but...
12609 : Aha, it's you, %. I never need to break out the ol' lasso when you're around. You always seem to know exactly when I need to find you.
12610 : We've heard a few whoops 'n 'ollers from concerned citizens about some young people skirtin' in 'n out of the waterways. It looks like they're up to no good, given all the whisperin' and mumblin' they do.
12611 : Now, I'd say these reports hold about as much water as an upside-down plate, and it seems the Peacekeepers' Coalition is inclined to agree. They won't have any of it.
12612 : I know they seem insignificant, but we need to cover all corners o' the corral on the off chance they're true. Especially given the hist'ry of the issue and that duel the other day.
12613 : Could you do me a favor and mosey on down to the Rala Waterways to check things out?
12614 : Visit whose Mog Garden? No one's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's. 's.
12615 : You decided you have better things to do.
12616 : Commencing transportation to the selected individual's Mog Garden.
12617 : You have yet to be invited.
12618 : You are currently unable to visit that person's Mog Garden.
12619 : <Sigh> Hm? Oh, hiya, %.
12620 : You're probably more at home bashing in skulls than playing politics, but...have you heard the rumors about Lord Melvien?
12621 : Have you heard what happened to Melvien? Of course. What a tragedy. What's a Melvien?
12622 : The shock waves of the news shook the city harder than those recent landshivers! 'Course, you've seen him in the flesh, so who am I to tell you what a hardworking, dedicated man he was?
12623 : C'mon, %, don't toy with me like that. Maybe you were too busy with land surveys to notice, so I'll fill you in--they found his corpse in Kamihr Drifts.
12624 : Remember how Maester Lhe sent you off to the Couriers' Coalition 'cause the minister was having trouble keeping tabs on shipments? I'll bet my bottom bayld that's what started the whole shebang.
12625 : But Kamihr Drifts? What's a hoity-toity minister doin' all the way out there?
12626 : His order is positively in shambles! They're out of steam from covering his duties, never mind finding a replacement...or, more likely, replacements.
12627 : Why? Well, Melvien could do the work of a hundred men, and now they've gotta divvy it up.
12628 : What will you ask? What order was he, again? What do you mean, divvy it up?
12629 : The Order of Woltaris, of which he was the head honcho. I'd give you a history lesson, but the Celennia Memorial Library's a better place for that.
12630 : Well, let's use an example that strikes close to home. Let's say Leath...<cough> Maester Lhe, who is able to do more than the rest of the coalition, ends up sending you and me to do her dirty work.
12631 : Ugh...even thinkin' of it makes my skin crawl.
12632 : 'Course, this would be true of any order. But to think all this would happen right when colonization was just hitting its stride!
12633 : Especially when the word is you've all found a way deeper into that Ra'Kazillion or whatever.
12634 : And lately, the ground has been shaking more than just metaphorically...
12635 : Ugh, speaking of...!
12636 : I-I think that might be the biggest landshiver yet. I tell you, this just ain't natural.
12637 : You and the princess were all smiles when you returned from the continent, so I figured all was right with the world...
12638 : ...But things are never that simple, are they? And now, with the whole Melvien debacle, the leaders of the other eleven orders are at each others' throats like the raptors down in Watergarden Coliseum!
12639 : I can only imagine the mopey look on the princess's angelic face.
12640 : %...if anyone knows how to rouse her spirits, it's you.
12641 : Go to Arciela--for both our sakes.
12642 : Come to shoot the breeze again, %? Then let me ask--know anything 'bout all the strange reports we keep getting?
12643 : What do you know? That it's all Melvien's doing! Strange? Can you be more specific?
12644 : Wh-wh-what!?
12645 : You gotta have some respect for the dead! You and I're close, so I know you didn't mean offense--but I wouldn't go around shouting that from the rooftops!
12646 : Well, Yorcia Weald and Cirdas Caverns were never really great vacation destinations to begin with, but lately, it's gotten worse. Unidentified beasts're prowling all over, killing pioneers and support staff indiscriminately. Then came the miasma...
12647 : Unearthly gales, winds piercing the skin like daggers, choleric miasmas choking the land...it's terrible out there, %, just terrible.
12648 : Adoulinians grow up being taught to fear the forest, so it shouldn't come as such a surprise...but I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been blindsided.
12649 : And it's not just me--the entire coalition's whipped into a frenzy, because nothing we think of helps.
12650 : Doesn't matter if you're up aboveground or sulking in the caves--pioneering's all-encompassing, and without a proper countermeasure our hands're tied.
12651 : Things've only gotten worse since Melvien's passing...
12652 : Even the leathery one hasn't been the same. Some days back, she went to some convocation of the twelve orders up at the castle, and when she returned her face was white as a sheet and she's remained clammed up ever since.
12653 : Landshivers, mysterious deaths, quiet maesters...what's Adoulin coming to?
12654 : <Sigh>
12655 : Tell me, %. Tell me things'll come out all right.
12656 : What's your reaction? I, uh... Of course they will!
12657 : Wh-why are you stuttering!? If it's got you spooked, then what hope do the rest of us have?
12658 : Ph-phew. Hearing you say it almost makes me believe it.
12659 : Now that I think about it, I haven't seen Arciela 'round here recently. You been keeping tabs on her?
12660 : You gotta bring some joy to her face. Her smile fills my heart with hope.
12661 : Now that I think about it, I haven't seen Arciela 'round here recently. I think you'd better make sure she's all right.
12662 : %!
12663 : What with the commotion at the castle, I knew it'd be best if we met here. Surely the news has reached your ears, too.
12664 : Did you hear the news? What news? You mean the rumors about Ulbuka.
12665 : How couldn't you be...? I thought you had feelers out everywhere, but maybe this one passed you by. I'll fill you in.
12666 : The buzz at the Pioneers' Coalition is that something is very, very wrong in the jungle.
12667 : Yes, exactly.
12668 : Luckily, I've access to the closed stacks at the Celennia Memorial Library thanks to our previous dealings with them, and I've spent many days and nights toiling over the tomes, cross-checking those rumors with past records.
12669 : I've discovered that there are references to the Cimmerian Adherents...the followers of Hades. Their coming in past ages was accompanied by toxic miasmas, blades of wind, and the sullying of the land.
12670 : Those must be the Xol Triumvirate that unsettled Sajj'aka.
12671 : Surely you haven't forgotten what that sadistic clown Balamor introduced himself as?
12672 : The Deathborne Xol. That'd mean he's one of the triumvirate, right?
12673 : And then there was that ominous passage after he vanished in Rala Waterways.
12674 : Those who heeded his call and swore allegiance to his cause will soon awaken.
12675 : I'm worried, %.
12676 : Two locations in particular have been singled out as particularly menacing in recent days--Cirdas Caverns and Yorcia Weald.
12677 : If we interpret the sullying of the land as Balamor and his minions, then that leaves the remaining two Xol.
12678 : One for the toxic miasma, and one for the blades of wind.
12679 : The rumors, fragmented as they are, match up perfectly. But the library's historical works are likewise incomplete, and I fear I've exhausted all available resources.
12680 : But there is someone else on our side--a hero who was there to witness it all.
12681 : Who is she referring to? Sajj'aka. Morimar.
12682 : That's right. He fought alongside the founder king, and ever since has tirelessly worked to shield Ulbuka from harm. If anyone can help us, it's him.
12683 : That's right. One of the founder king's generals who has seen the forces of evil face-to-face. If anyone can help us, it's him.
12684 : So that's our next destination--Mt. Kamihr!
12685 : Look! It's %!
12686 : And the prinshesh, too!
12687 : Tiana? Is that you?
12688 : You guysh are the besht!
12689 : Of coursh I'm glad to shee you! You reshcued everyone!
12690 : I had the shtrangesht dream...
12691 : I shaw you and % riding a big white dragon with a bunch of pretty golden lightsh around you!
12692 : And then the lightsh came to me, too, and I woke up!
12693 : And grampa and mama and papa were there, crying.
12694 : They shaid I had been shleeping a real long time!
12695 : I know what happened!
12696 : You and % helped me jusht like you did back in the foresht!
12697 : Before it was some herbsh for my grampa, but thish time you woke me from my dream!
12698 : I know it!
12699 : How do you respond? You may be right. What a lovely dream.
12700 : I knew it!
12701 : No, I know it washn't just a dream!
12702 : %, can I ashk a question?
12703 : Do you remember when you and the prinshesh helped me, and I shaid how much I wanna learn magic?
12704 : Do you remember? Of course I do! Not really...
12705 : I knew you would!
12706 : You're shuch a meanie!
12707 : Magic looksh sho wonderful, sho I thought it'd be fun!
12708 : But you know what I wanna do now?
12709 : I want to be jusht like you.
12710 : A big, shtrong pioneer!
12711 : Then I can be friendsh with the foresht and play with all the animalsh!
12712 : How do you react? It's tough out there. I've got a new rival!
12713 : I don't care! I'm gonna go explore the foresht!
12714 : We can be rivalsh?
12715 : Don't think I'll go eashy on you!
12716 : Me and my friendsh are gonna go do shome training to become the beshtesht pioneers ever!
12717 : Shee you shoon!
12718 : Big hugsh to both of you!
12719 : Do I look like I've got time to barrrter with neophytes? Off with you!
12720 : So much to do, so little time... Wait. How did you get your grrrubby hands on that %?
12721 : Amazing--to think I'd actually see a paragon up close! It shines even more brightly than I'd been told!
12722 : <Cough> Allow me to prrroffer an explanation.
12723 : Paragons are trrreasures gleaned from vanquishing Naakuals, and the secrets harbored within can be used to inscribe certain curios with arcane glyptics.
12724 : The energies therein are so delicate and purrre that every arcanist in the city is itching to get their hands on them. Imagine the look on Divainy-Gamainy's face when I tell him that I...<cough>
12725 : I've gotten sidetrrracked. The only thing an adventurer needs to know is that one paragon will provide two different arcane glyptics.
12726 : For example, with weapons, I can inscrrribe...
12727 : And for arrrmor...
12728 : That's all there is to it!
12729 : Ah, but I said that each paragon could provide two glyptics. The second rrrests on the identity of the paragon you bring me.
12730 : With your %, I can inscrrribe weapons with...
12731 : Worrrking with the paragons is a simple affair, but given the intensity of their auras, I can only inscribe them on very specific equipment.
12732 : They must be able to withstand the infusing process. We artisans refer to these types of equipment as rrresonant.
12733 : But since you have a paragon on hand, then surrrely you have a piece of resonant equipment already.
12734 : Don't worry about losing equipment unsuited for this endeavor. A veteran of my caliberrr can hold a piece in my paw and know instantly whether or not it would survive the process.
12735 : Any questions, or should we get to worrrk?
12736 : What will you ask? To see the list of arcane glyptics. Nothing.
12737 : Leaving so soon? Come back if you need me to lend a paw!
12738 : Which parrragon are you interested in?
12739 : View which paragon? Shared arcane glyptics. %. %. %. %. %. %. Back.
12740 : I can inscrrribe the following on [weapons/ranged weapons/armor].
12741 : Shared arcane glyptics: Accuracy+30. Magic Accuracy+30. Occasionally attacks twice. Back.
12742 : Shared arcane glyptics: Ranged Accuracy+30. Magic Accuracy+30. Occasionally attacks twice. Back.
12743 : Shared arcane glyptics: HP+30 MP+30. Physical/Magic damage taken -2%. Haste+2% "Snapshot"+2. Back.
12744 : I can inscrrribe the following arcane glyptics unique to % on [weapons/armor].
12745 : %: Evasion+15. "Store TP"+5. Ranged Accuracy+15. Back.
12746 : %: Magic Evasion+15. Magic Accuracy+15. MP+30. Back.

12751 : %: Evasion+10. AGI+8. "Fast Cast"+3. Back.
12752 : %: "Magic Def. Bonus"+2. MND+8. Magic Evasion+10. Back.

12755 : %: "Counter"+2. DEX+8. Skillchain damage +2. Back.
12756 : %: Magic Damage+4. INT+8. MP+30. Back.
12757 : Yes, a purrrfect specimen. Can you sense the slight tingling as it resonates with your paragon?
12758 : Select a paragon. %. %. %. %. %. %. Never mind.
12759 : That % would make a wonderrrful addition. Just tell me which type of glyptic you are interested in, and I'll get started.
12760 : Select the [first/second] arcane glyptic.
12761 : Your weapon'll come out looking something like this.
12762 : Is this acceptable? Positively peachy. Back to the beginning. Agonizingly atrocious.
12763 : I'd call this a success! Can you not sense the aura emanating from the surrrface? That's the paragon's power in action!
12764 : Change your mind? Well, a paragon is your trrreasure to use as you see fit. Come back again if you decide you're interested.
12765 : Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha? Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!
12766 : While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it. Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum. Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.
12767 : Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm!  Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'. Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?
12768 : Oh yeah, 'fore I forget. What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.
12769 : Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...
12770 : Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes. Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more. "Good things come tah dose who wait," right? Well, da longer ya wait, da gooder da thing...maybe. Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.
12771 : Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer daily tally. It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.
12772 : Finally, ya opens da chest. Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!
12773 : Oh, dat's right! Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase! Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?
12774 : And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy! But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.
12775 : Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it. Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.
12776 : Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble. It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.
12777 : Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in. Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.
12778 : Dat all make 'nough sense tah ya? Just say da woid when ya wanna use my services. I's more'n happy tah help.
12779 : Hey! I rem'mber seein' yer foice 'round here. Take a looksie. I's taken' it upon myself tah jigger 'round wit' dese all-new myst'ry boxes, found straight from an ol' capsized vessel in the Gugru Blue.
12780 : I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!
12781 : Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?
12782 : Dese're some special dials, an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!

12819 : #<#
12820 : I understand that you are...an adventurer? My name is Pieuje I. d'Oraguille, commander of San d'Oria's famed Temple Knights.
12821 : Is that %'s voice I hear?
12822 : Forgive me, but I am more accustomed to recognizing faces than voices, especially through such a peculiar device.
12823 : I must thank you for your handling of the Altedour incident in Fei'Yin.
12824 : Never once have I forgotten your dedication to protecting all of San d'Oria.
12825 : As you are doubtlessly aware, a short time ago I received a memorandum from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network detailing Unity Concord and requesting my services as a Unity leader.
12826 : Tell me. Is there any greater way for a prince regent to earn honor for his kingdom than by spearheading a group dedicated to purging evil from the land?
12827 : Many around me were opposed, but that bothered me not. My brother, Trion, serves as a representative of the Trust initiative, and it falls to me to up the ante.
12828 : I cannot lie. That was an important factor in my decision.
12829 : But be not concerned with our internal squabbles. Know only that it pleases me to welcome you to my Unity.
12830 : My name is Ayame, a ranking member of the Mythril Musketeers. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
12831 : Haha...yes, %, of course I remember you. How characteristic of you to have your fingers in everyone's pies.
12832 : Do not think me ungrateful. No, I am always pleased to have your help, but this time things are a bit different.
12833 : Do not think me ungrateful. You strengthened the Mythril Musketeers in ways I never thought possible, and we are closer than ever before.
12834 : Not terribly long ago I was contacted by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, which asked that I head a Unity.
12835 : At first I was flustered and thought of turning the offer down. Why would they pick me when there are others more qualified?
12836 : But Volker decided it would be the perfect opportunity for me to develop my leadership skills, and told them I would accept...without my knowledge.
12837 : Though unconvinced that I am the best fit, I pledge to dedicate myself wholly to this endeavor.
12838 : People are counting on me. Not only Volker, but those like you who have pledged their support.
12839 : I will not let you down.
12840 : Stand sharp, maggot! I've got no time for people who're gonna slack off!
12841 : ...Wait. That's you, isn't it, %?
12842 : I hear you've decided to join my backbreaking Unity.
12843 : Well!? What've you got to say for yourself!?
12844 : How do you respond? That's right. Nope. Y-yessir!
12845 : Impudent cretin! You say sir when addressing a superior officer!
12846 : Better. Everyone in my Unity is equal--you're all worthless whelps!
12847 : We don't coddle the weak around here. If you want respect, you earn it.
12848 : Until then, you're just a dried-up, shriveled worm!
12849 : So go crawling around in the dirt and pray some crow doesn't sweep down and gobble you up!
12850 : Now get out there!
12851 : Hello, good adventurer. You can call me Apururu.
12852 : Is that...%? Am I rightaru?
12853 : Your good deeds on behalf of Windurstaru have not gone unnoticed.
12854 : I'm so worried about my brother...but if this is one way for me to help-welp him, then so be it.
12855 : Ajido-Marujido has awoken at lastaru, but...no, I'll not let myself cry. I must work for the good of Windurst.
12856 : You brought hope to a Windurst that was on the brink-wink of despair.
12857 : I've been selected to serve as the head of a Unity-wunity, and can I ever say...
12858 : As the head of the Manustery, there can be no greater honor than--
12859 : Aaaaaall right! Now the Cardian workshop can finally turn something resembling a profitaru!
12860 : tHiS iS aBsoLUtElY WonDErFul. NoW wE HaVe MOneY, ALl ThaNkS tO APurURu!
12861 : H-hey! It's not like I'll be making bank-wank!
12862 : Putting that aside--welcome to my Unitaru!
12863 : We can do together-wether what we couldn't individually.
12864 : Phew... So you're my new pupil, eh?
12865 : Phew... So you're my new pu... %?
12866 : The way you shone when the two of us met in combat...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't impressed.
12867 : I've gotta say, you sure knew how to show me the old what-for...it was like staring into the face of a demon!
12868 : I've lived many years on this green Vana'diel, but you're the only one I've ever proffered my hat to.
12869 : ...Let's discuss how all this came to be.
12870 : The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network came up with this Unity idea, and asked me to be one of its founding masters.
12871 : But I'm not the kind to take on disciples, so at first I was more than a bit wary.
12872 : But the old lady, she nagged me, and nagged me, and nagged me until I finally caved in.
12873 : How do you respond? You can always quit, you know. Must have been tough for you. That's quite the wife you've got.
12874 : Ugh... I didn't expect you to come at me with that.
12875 : Tough doesn't begin to describe it! I was hoping to spend my twilight years for myself, but you gotta play the hand you're dealt.
12876 : Please tell me that you weren't in on it!
12877 : Either way, that's not important now. As long as I'm the master of a ragtag group of youngsters, I'm gonna make sure you all get the training you deserve.
12878 : But to do that, I'm gonna need your help.
12879 : And I'll warn you--my regimens have been known to be...strict.
12880 : And I'm sure I don't need to tell you how strict my regimens are!
12881 : What's the password?
12882 : How do you respond? Rose on the heath. Tavnazia.
12883 : Who's this!? ...Ah, this is the Unity communication device. Forget I said anything.
12884 : Aldo of the Tenshodo, at your service.
12885 : Who's this!? ...Ah, this is the Unity communication...wait. You're %, aren't you?
12886 : The way this little thing is buzzing tells me that you're looking to join my Unity.
12887 : My Unity being the key here. Who else did you expect to be the leader?
12888 : I'm sure the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network would make for...excellent customers in the future.
12889 : Serve the Unity well and I promise you'll want for nothing.
12890 : You found hope where once I had lost it. Lion was alive and I'll never forget all you've done.
12891 : All that she had worked and fought for...we owe it to her to live our lives to the fullest.
12892 : Working with others for a common goal is the greatest reward of all.
12893 : And it's people like you who I need to understand that most.
12894 : Well, do we have a new rrrecruit? I'm Jakoh Wahcondalo, chieftainess of Kazham.
12895 : Come to think of it...didn't I teach you the secrets of eviscerrration?
12896 : Hah-hah-hah! Then all the better for my Unity!
12897 : Are you sure...are you sure you're not currrsed by %?
12898 : Can never be too carrreful these days...
12899 : Let's cut to the quick. You've joined my Unity, corrrect?
12900 : Then welcome.
12901 : But a quick word of warrrning.
12902 : I'm in charrrge here, so don't go about being disruptive!
12903 : If you can do that, we'll have no prrroblems. Now get to it!
12904 : H-hello, you've reached Salaheem's Sentinels.
12905 : There's no problem we can't solve, big or small!
12906 : Aha, we have a new visitor? One moment--I'll get the president for you.
12907 : Yes, this is Naja Salaheem.
12908 : Ah, have we an adventurerrr applying today?
12909 : You could not have picked a betterrr place to be.
12910 : Our Unity is completely free of charge, making it the purrrfect place to hang up your sword and meet some new companions.
12911 : We considerrr it our calling to provide an excellent place for those of all strrripes to utilize their talents in a variety of combat scenes.
12912 : Abquhbah! Get your lazy butt over here!
12913 : S-sorry. Yes, [good sir/my lady], this is Abquhbah of Salaheem's Sentinels.
12914 : We have a variety of powerful backers supporting our organization...
12915 : ...So I'm certain you'll find achieving a high Unity ranking to be a breeze.
12916 : And if we do, then there will be a lovely gift of sweets waiting. Yes, some gold pieces of--
12917 : <Sigh>... Oh, heavens, I think this device isn't worrrking properly. Can you hear me now?
12918 : How do you respond? Loud and clear. Where's Abquhbah? Just what did you do?
12919 : Please forrrgive his impudence.
12920 : We're looking forward to having you serrrve in our regiment.
12921 : And we hope you enjoy your looong stay in our rrranks!
12922 : Oho? Is that % I hear?
12923 : %? Gimme that!
12924 : Picturrre that, hearing from [a non-employee/a second class private/a first class private/a superior private/a lance corporal/a corporal/a sergeant/a sergeant major/a chief sergeant/a second lieutenant/a first lieutenant/a captain] such as yourself.
12925 : You've got some gall shirrrking your duties like this!
12926 : But since you've joined my Unity, I'm willing to overlook that little trrransgression.
12927 : Let's paint the rankings rrred with our unstoppable team!
12928 : And that rrrequires you to not sit around like some good-for-nothing! You belong not just to one of my teams, but to two!
12929 : Be thankful you have work and get your butt out there!
12930 : The magic doll you are trying to reach is either suffering from mystical interference or is not attuned to a bearer.
12931 : Please check the settings and try a-again... Mmph...
12932 : Ahaha! Who can ever resist a good joke? It's me, and no other!
12933 : How do you react? Flaviria? Arciela? Who?
12934 : Oho, expertly deduced! I'd expect no less!
12935 : Huh? Arciela? That little waif of a princess? Granted, I'm quite pretty as well...
12936 : Urk...I'd have expected you to go with the joke...
12937 : But let's get down to business.
12938 : I'm Flaviria, maester of Adoulin's Mummers' Coalition.
12939 : I'm Flaviria, of course. I'm sure you've been to the Mummers' Coalition more than once, so my name should be quite familiar.
12940 : The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network invited me to be a Unity leader...and how could I say no?
12941 : Though truth be told, I wonder why they picked me over one of the other leaders of the twelve orders.
12942 : Now that I think of it, didn't you trounce one of our more enigmatic patrons in a game of Boom or Bust?
12943 : And here I thought that the man in black couldn't be bested.
12944 : I'd better brush up, or you'll be coming for me next!
12945 : Either way, welcome to my Unity! I'm not completely clear on how best to proceed, but let's find the path together.
12946 : Ahem. <Cough-ethy>
12947 : So you're the young mind who's come to join-ethy my Unity?
12948 : Well met, I am Dr. Yoran-Oran, former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery in Windurst, and involved in all manner of magical research.
12949 : Ah, didn't you assist-ethy me with my mandragora research back then? Those items were of great help, thank you.
12950 : Ah, I know that voice-ethy! %, that's you, isn't it?
12951 : Your efforts-ethy saved the Great Star Tree. Windurst owes you a deep debt of gratitude.
12952 : Listen %. Those three monstrosities you so kindly brought into my life have put me in a very disconcerting situation-ethy. I have a lot more to say about it, but for now let's focus-ethy on the issue at hand.
12953 : Things have slowly gone back to normal-ethy now that the wretched trio of chaos incarnate has left. I've finally managed to begin work-ethy on my next book.
12954 : Thank you again for your aid during the Shantotto crisis-ethy. Were it not for you, our entire dimension would have been twisted and defiled beyond recognition. I still get nightmares-ethy thinking about it.
12955 : You see, I have many students who regularly come-ethy to me to learn from my vast well of knowledge, but the students who buy my books are by far the best-ethy.
12956 : One of these students was part of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network-ethy and invited me to become a Unity leader.
12957 : I hesitated, of course. Wasting my intellectual prowess in the adventuring business-ethy didn't seem fitting for a scholar like myself.
12958 : But then I thought-ethy some more.
12959 : Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?
12960 : With this flawless object in mind, I've decided-ethy to accept the nomination as Unity leader.
12961 : And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.
12962 : You see, I have many students who regularly come-ethy to me to learn from my vast well of knowledge, but the students who buy my books are by far the best-ethy.
12963 : One of these students was part of the Adventurers Mutual Aid Network-ethy and invited me to become a Unity leader.
12964 : I hesitated, of course. Wasting my intellectual prowess in the adventuring business-ethy didn't seem fitting for a scholar like myself.
12965 : But then I thought-ethy some more.
12966 : Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?
12967 : With this flawless object in mind, I've decided-ethy to accept the nomination as Unity leader.
12968 : And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.
12969 : .........
12970 : Oh! Right! I should probably say something. I'm Sylvie. As you can probably guess from these clothes. I'm a geomanger--I mean, geomancer!
12971 : Oh, I forgot...you can't see my clothes, right? Forget I said that, okay?
12972 : Oh, huh? %? Is that %?
12973 : Oh, %, it's you.
12974 : %! It's %!
12975 : How are you getting along with your luopan? Have you gotten used to using Colures, yet? If you keep your head and shoulders to the grindstone I'm sure you'll master it!
12976 : I know Daddy's training can be rough, but it looks like you passed his test with flying pigs...is that how you say that?
12977 : Did you know that Daddy would speak really highly of you? He would always talk about how a promising new geomancer showed up and was looking forward to seeing what you could do... He seemed so happy.
12978 : I can still feel your Communion. If it weren't for you back there, we would have been domed, I mean doomed. Anyway, thank you %.
12979 : It's all thanks to you that we were able to fulfill Zacariah's duty. You're like the most...stupenderrific hero to all us Zacariahs!
12980 : So...I guess this mean you'll be joining my Unity?
12981 : Thank you so much. It means a lot to me.  As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.
12982 : Ikhi said this wasn't a good time for me to be leading a Unity.
12983 : But...I couldn't just stay at home doing nothing. It's easier to forget the sad things when you've got a lot to do, you know?
12984 : So when the offer for Unity leader came, I had to accept.
12985 : You can't stay blue forever. Daddy would probably laugh at me if he saw how down and depressivated I am these days.
12986 : ...Right, smile Sylvie! Let's make this Unity work. With you as part of the team, I'm sure our efforts will bring us bear fruit. Huh...why do they call it bear fruit?
12987 : Wait, so does this mean you'll be joining my Unity?
12988 : As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.
12989 : With you on our team, we'll be truly unstoppableable!
12990 : To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure what to do when the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network first invited me.
12991 : If it weren't for Ikhi's guidance, I'd be down a creek full of paddles.
12992 : She said if the Unity could show people everywhere how to communicate with nature and spread the ways of the geomancer, then it was something worth doing.
12993 : There's still a lot I don't know as a geomancer, but I'm going to triple down and do my best as UL.
12994 : Let's make this the best Unity we can!
12995 : Yeah, go team!
12996 : And...if you happened to be in Western Adoulin...and are also interested in geomancy, come see me by the docks. Wait, but not like...in a weird way, okay?
12997 : It might be in your best interests to speak to [Urbiolaine/Igsli/Teldro-Kesdrodo/Nunaarl Bthtrogg] in % [(G-10)/(E-11)/(J-10)/(H-11)].

13020 : Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
13021 : Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.
13022 : Unity is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.
13023 : Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.
13024 : Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as %.
13025 : Chat settings may be changed by selecting Status from the main menu, and choosing Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
13026 : You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.
13027 : Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.
13028 : The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.
13029 : Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).
13030 : Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.
13031 : Wanted objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.
13032 : These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as Unity accolades to undertake.
13033 : Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.
13034 : Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.
13035 : The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.
13036 : A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.
13037 : Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.
13038 : Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.
13039 : When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.
13040 : Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.
13041 : No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.
13042 : You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.
13043 : An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.
13044 : One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.
13045 : A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.
13046 : You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.
13047 : Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.
13048 : Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.
13049 : Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.
13050 : The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.
13051 : It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.
13052 : The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.
13053 : Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.
13054 : These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.
13055 : Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.
13056 : Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of # accolades per week (Earth time).
13057 : You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.
13058 : This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.
13059 : This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.
13060 : However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.
13061 : Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.
13062 : The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.
13063 : Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.
13064 : Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.
13065 : On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.
13066 : Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by #. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.
13067 : The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.
13068 : Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.
13069 : Those with evaluations of # or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.
13070 : Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.
13071 : A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.
13072 : Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.
13073 : A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.
13074 : It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.
13075 : Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.
13076 : ou are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.
13077 : he A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.
13078 : ou call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.
13079 : ou have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.
13080 : hould you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?
13081 : Teleport anyway? Yes, please. No, thank you.
13082 : Is it playtime alrrready? Oh, I do love reeling in a fresh catch!
13083 : But you're a little too rrraw, even for me. Come back once you've had a chance to simmer under, say, # Records of Eminence objective[/s].
13084 : Now, before you go around caterwauling, let me point you to Eternal Flame right there. He can get you started.
13085 : I only play with those who've some meat on their bones. Set the Rrrecords of Eminence tutorial objective % and come back when you're done.
13086 : And what a fine one I've got my paws on today! You've come here to participate in Unity Concorrrd, haven't you?
13087 : How do you respond? There's something fishy about this. I'm interested in Unity Concord. Tell me more about this playtime.
13088 : Not going to take the bait? That's a downrrright shame. Come back if you've changed your mind.
13089 : Nunaarl Bthtrogg stares you down.
13090 : Hmm hmm... Yes, a fine specimen you make indeed!
13091 : Hmm hmm... Not quite what I was hoping for, but you'll have to do.
13092 : Well... There's one condition--you have to join a Unity firrrst!
13093 : Of course you are! To get starrrted you'll need to get your claws on the % objective.
13094 : First, let me give you this whale of a %.
13095 : <Bleep>
13096 : Nunaarl Bthtrogg shoves the % into your hands.
13097 : I suppose I betterrr explain what Unity Concord is, lest your mental vessel capsize. Unity Concord is a special type of gathering formed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
13098 : They share one similarity with linkshells--people from the four corners of Vana'diel come togetherrr to accomplish things that they could not do alone.
13099 : But it isn't any old fishing expedition. That % rrrecords all of your good deeds and stores them inside its adorable cotton confines.
13100 : So why not get your feet wet? The tasks you'll be doing are rrrelatively simple in nature.
13101 : The first thing you'll have to do is choose a Unity--an orrrganization headed by some of Vana'diel's most storied personages.
13102 : Select one and set sail!
13103 : Urk... You'll never have a good catch if you don't even cast your net!
13104 : Gimme back that doll. You clearrrly won't be needing it for now.
13105 : Back for more? Then I'll give you back this %.
13106 : Now, have you finally got a Unity in mind?
13107 : [Pieuje/Ayame/Invincible Shield/Apururu/Maat/Aldo/Jakoh Wahcondalo/Naja Salaheem/Flaviria/Yoran-Oran/Sylvie]'s as good a leaderrr as any. Are you sure?
13108 : Excellent! The firrrst thing you'll need to do is give your leader a few words of greeting.
13109 : Gimme your % so I can make a few adjustments.
13110 : Nunaarl Bthtrogg pokes and prods at your %.
13111 : The % writhes in agony!
13112 : I swear, it's like deboning a Tavnazian goby! Phew! It should be all connected to your leaderrr now.
13113 : So? How does it feel to have cast anchorrr at your new Unity?
13114 : I'm expecting a bit of a bonus for this... Nyahaha! Let's keep that between us.
13115 : Your head might be swimming from all this inforrrmation, but your % can talk with people over long distances.
13116 : Of course, that means your Unity allies. There's no way you'll drown when there are frrriends waiting to pull you back aboard!
13117 : But you'll never know who those friends are if you don't say anything, so trrry it out!
13118 : You can learrrn more about Unity chat by selecting Status and then navigating to Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
13119 : It's a lot to take in, but you'll get your bearrrings soon.
13120 : And I'll be here waiting if you're ever lost at sea.
13121 : Need some navigation?
13122 : Setting sail forrr %?
13123 : You can't pull the wool over my eyes! You don't have enough accolades!
13124 : Let's see...you can still exchange # more accolade[/s] this week.
13125 : Nothing like rrrubbing some oil on equipment to make it shine. Here's what it'll look like:
13126 : The artisan'll rrrequire # ), %, and a fee of # accolade[/s] to make % for you.
13127 : You can't rrrush perfection, so it'll take some time for your piece to be completed. But you'll be satisfied with the results, right as rain!
13128 : ...Wait. Rrright now you've got % on hold. There's such a huge waiting list that I can't allow you to monopolize two spots!
13129 : Adding a new attrrribute to your item will look like this...
13130 : Your item will probably turn out as follows once its rrrank is increased.
13131 : If you wish to add an attribute to your %, bring it along with % and the rrrequisite fee of # accolade[/s].
13132 : Oh, you'll also need to complete the Records of Eminence objective % firrrst.
13133 : To boost the rrrank of your %, bring it with some %. The more you provide, the larger the increase will be.
13134 : Once you make your rrrequest, I'll be handling everything for you personally.
13135 : Leave it to me! I've spent a lot of time prrreparing for this moment!
13136 : %, hmmmmmmmmm? Might not be what I'd have fished up, but if that's what makes you happy... It'll rrrun you # accolade[/s].
13137 : How many you want to get your paws on? (1 to #)
13138 : You got it. # of those comes to a total of # accolade[/s].
13139 : Herrre you go!
13140 : Hrm? You say you want to jump ship?
13141 : I make it a policy not to stick my whiskerrrs in other people's business. Just tell me where you would like to go.
13142 : Considerrr it done!
13143 : Decided to put the ol' life rrraft back?
13144 : I've got a cute little volume that'll rrrun you through the basics. Have a look.
13145 : You'll first need to pick a Unity that rrrings true to your heart.
13146 : Then fill up your bags with proverbial bucketloads of Records of Eminence objectives to earrrn unity accolades.
13147 : Acquire enough accolades and you'll need a portside warrrehouse to store all the items you'll be getting.
13148 : It's a bit more complicated than that, but surrrely you get the gist.
13149 : Rrready to have your % enhanced?
13150 : Our arcane artisan rrrequires a fee of # accolade[/s]. That okay with you?
13151 : I'll make sure it gets to him on the next trading vessel. Never fear--it's purrrfectly secure.
13152 : Were you just pulling my tail? Herrre, you can have this back.
13153 : We're polishing up your %! It'll be rrready a little later.
13154 : Your piece made it back in one...piece. Congrrratulations on your spiffy new %!
13155 : What's this? Are you herrre to power up your %?
13156 : It'll rrrequire # accolade[/s] to complete the process. Do we have a deal?
13157 : Here's your piece...hot out of the forge! Congrrratulations!
13158 : Too bad, I was about to show you what I'm capable of. Herrre, you can have this back.
13159 : If you want to rrrun with the big cats, you'll need to complete the Records of Eminence objective % first and then come see me again.
13160 : Hm? You want to use # ) to store Reinforcement Points for yourrr %?
13161 : Behold the marrrvel that is this piece! Hurry up and test it in the field!
13162 : How unfortunate... I was really looking forward to this. Herrre, you can have this back.
13163 : Good day, adventurer! I am able to repair any broken item data related to %.
13164 : If you are unable to deliver %, it's possible that the item data has been corrupted.
13165 : Please trade your % to me so that I may fix it.
13166 : I have confirmed that the item data for your % has been corrupted. We apologize for the inconvenience.
13167 : I have restored it to its intended functionality. Here you are!
13168 : It appears that your item is working as intended.
13169 : An error has occurred. Please try again later.
13170 : Are you also looking for Master Valli?
13171 : There was a woman here searching for him as well. Ah, there she is over there.
13172 : Oh, it's you!
13173 : Do you happen to know where Valli and Oshasha are going?
13174 : Do you know their destination? Yes, I do. Sorry. Who are you?
13175 : Huh?
13176 : You had best stop lying to me!
13177 : I see... That's too bad...
13178 : My name is Er... I mean Lerene. I am here searching the ruins. You could say I am a kind of researcher.
13179 : My name is Lerene. Have we met before?
13180 : My name is Lerene. I am here searching the ruins. You could say I am a kind of researcher.
13181 : I received a message from Oshasha and Valli and came here as soon as I could.
13182 : Have you heard anything from them?
13183 : They mentioned it would be rather difficult to decipher the %, so I figured it would take more time.
13184 : Ah! Do you know anything about the %?
13185 : Do you know about the %? Actually, I do. Sorry.
13186 : Really? You do? How?
13187 : Hm? Are you lying to me[?/ again?] If you know something, tell me!
13188 : I never imagined you were the pioneer that found the %, %.
13189 : In that case, did you hear the news? Oshasha received a letter all the way from Windurst?
13190 : She was apparently quite shocked by its contents, and has been lost in thought ever since.
13191 : Her fierce sense of responsibility means she has been bound by her past--no, the long and storied history of her family.
13192 : I am not at liberty to share the details, but I'm worried because she often has a tendency to do the unexpected.
13193 : After all, she did say something about summoning demons and asking them something directly...
13194 : Ah! Valli!
13195 : Lerene! What excellent timing!
13196 : Hm? Have we met before... No, I must be imagining it.
13197 : Where were you? And why isn't Oshasha here with you?
13198 : If you are asking that, I take it that means she is not back yet?
13199 : We got separated in the forest. I only took my eyes off her for a moment, but the next thing I knew, she was gone.
13200 : What!?
13201 : Where in the forest!? It wasn't anywhere dangerous, was it!?
13202 : It is an untainted section of the forest known as Leafallia in the Kamihr Drifts. She should not be in any immediate danger there...
13203 : However, we found a notice regarding the presence of a demon tribe known as the Dvergr, so we set out for their territory.
13204 : Demons!? That's the very definition of dangerous!
13205 : According to the %, it said that no harm would come to those who were deemed worthy...
13206 : However, we have no idea what makes someone worthy or not. Lerene, I am heading back to Leafallia.
13207 : I will follow along shortly. If any of that strange magic remains, it may be possible to track its arcane energies...
13208 : We could use your help too, %!
13209 : Hm? That name...
13210 : Valli, this is the pioneer that Oshasha asked to retrieve the %.
13211 : Ah, that is good to hear; there is strength in numbers. We could definitely use your help.
13212 : Now then, let us head for Leafallia at once.
13213 : Oshasha has gone missing in the forest? This is most distressing news!
13214 : I can't believe that Master Valli lost track of her!
13215 : Master Valli likes to keep it a secret, but he is actually a famous nobleman from the Middle Lands.
13216 : That's not important right now though. You must hurry to Leafallia and look for Oshasha!
