6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

6910 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
6911 : So far, we've only taken down # [enemy/enemies] today!
6912 : How many enemies have we defeated? Only #. You can count that high, right...?
6913 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
6914 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
6915 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
6916 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6917 : We've only beaten # [enemy/enemies] so far. Don't tell me you're tired already!?
6918 : Only # [enemy has/enemies have] fallen to us today! We're just getting started!
6919 : The last enemy we defeated was number #.
6920 : The last enemy we took down was number #.
6921 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
6922 : Only # [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
6923 : We've beaten at least two...right?
6924 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
6925 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
6926 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...
6927 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6928 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
6929 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
6930 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6931 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
6932 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
6933 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
6934 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
6935 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6936 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
6937 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
6938 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
6939 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
6940 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
6941 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6942 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
6943 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
6944 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
6945 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6946 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6947 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6948 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6949 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6950 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.

7216 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7217 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7218 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7219 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7220 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7221 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7222 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7223 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7224 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7225 : You've earned conquest points!
7226 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7227 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7228 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7229 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7230 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7231 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7232 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7233 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7234 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7235 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7236 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7237 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7238 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7239 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7240 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7241 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7242 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7243 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7244 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7245 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7246 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7247 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7248 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7249 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7250 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7251 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7252 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7253 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7254 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7255 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7256 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7257 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7258 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7259 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7260 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7261 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7262 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?

7723 : I have a good feeling about this place.

7727 : Eh? Not coming? Well, that's no fun...
7728 : Phew... I don't think I can handle any more fishing today, [son/missy]. I'm going to go home and get me a little shuteye.
7729 : Thanks for all the help. I guess I'll throw in the towel for today.
7730 : But the big one still got away, didn't she? But I'll be back out here tomorrow. You can bet on that!
7731 : I don't think I can handle any more fishing today, [son/missy]. I'm going to go home and get me a little shuteye. Come pick up your reward back in town.
7732 : I'll be seeing you around, %!

7746 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7747 : You sense a spine-chilling presence!
7748 : Wow, I can't believe how much time has passed already.
7749 : It feels like we only just jumped into that weird, swirling thingy.
7750 : Sanctia, that weird, swirling thingy is a manifestation of the Emptiness, kupopo!
7751 : If I hadn't been there, you'd still be swimming in oblivion. You have no idea how dangerous that was, kupopo!
7752 : There are so many scary places in Vana'diel these days.  I don't know why people leave their Mog Houses at all, kupopo!
7753 : As thanks for helping me out in the Sea Serpent Grotto, I'll take you home to Rabao now, kupopo.
7754 : We should set off right away. Your mom and dad must be frantic with worry, kupopo.
7755 : I'm not going back. I've made up my mind.
7756 : I'm going to become a fearless bounty hunter, and leave the poor, fragile, little me behind forever.
7757 : And besides, Papa probably hasn't even noticed I'm gone. He didn't even remember my birthday.
7758 : That's not true, kupopo!
7759 : There was an adventurer in Norg who came looking for you, kupopo.
7760 : Oh? Are you the one he's talking about?
7761 : Were you searching for Sanctia? That's why I'm here. Just passing through...
7762 : See, I told you! What perfect timing, kupopo!
7763 : I bet [he/she] was asked to lie about [his/her] mission, kupopo!
7764 : This is the adventurer your dad hired to find you, kupopo!
7765 : Where would Papa get the money to hire anyone?
7766 : Adventurer, who sent you to find me?
7767 : Who sent you? Chelvadurai. Zoriboh. That moogle right there.
7768 : Hmmm.
7769 : Sanctia looks at you disbelievingly.
7770 : Zoriboh!? I should've known he'd be worried about me...
7771 : But I can't go back. Please tell Zoriboh it's not his fault I left Rabao, and not to fret for me. I'll be just fine.
7772 : Just fine!? Run-ins with pirates, smugglers, and a vortex of darkness, and she says just fine, kupopo!
7773 : <Sigh> Please let Mister Zoriboh know that Sanctia is okay, kupopo.
7774 : I'll do my best to see that she stays just fine, kupopo!
7775 : What in Altana's name are you doing here?
7776 : Me? I have come to collect ingredients to make medicine.
7777 : You say Parelbriaux visited this spot as well?
7778 : But why would he...?
7779 : I must hurry back to the safehold!
7780 : Parelbriaux may be obnoxious at times but...
7781 : ...but if anything terrible were to befall him...
7782 : Oh, I heard from Ondieulix that you were searching for my bag.
7783 : ... Thank you...
7784 : Maybe Ondieulix was right.
7785 : Maybe adventurers are not all that bad...
7786 : A message has been engraved into the rock: Offer up the ancient shield, and the pact shall be honored.
7787 : Very well, I shall test thy mettle...
7788 : I am Amaltheia the Omnipotent. My almighty horns shall seal thy fate this day!
7789 : Nothing happens...
7790 : The stench of rotten flesh fills the air around you. Some scavenger must have made this place its territory.
7791 : You set % on the ground. The smell becomes almost unbearable. Suddenly, a huge creature approaches and starts sniffing around!
7792 : Nothing happens.
7793 : Kurrea slurps down the adamantoise soup!
7794 : Kurrea's muscles bulge crazily!
7795 : Kurrea's scales shine mysteriously!
7796 : Kurrea is enveloped by a fierce wind!
7797 : Kurrea's hide grows rigid!
7798 : The veins in Kurrea's head are popping out!
7799 : Kurrea's eyes glow weirdly!
7800 : Kurrea's wounds disappear!
7801 : Kurrea is surrounded by an ominous aura!
7802 : Kurrea's face has turned green...
7803 : Hey, %!
7804 : Have you heard? The wyrms that were circling above Tavnazia have disappeared.
7805 : It's all over. The town has finally found peace again.
7806 : I haven't seen Miss Mildaurion for a while, but she did send a messenger. Looks like Jeuno is willing to continue supporting the safehold.
7807 : Unlike Nag'molada's flimsy promises, with this arrangement we'll be able to govern ourselves.
7808 : I have never seen Granpere so excited. He plans to hire adventurers to exterminate all the fiends, and then sow fields in Lufaise and Misareaux.
7809 : He also intends to restore the shepherd villages on Cape Riverne, although a great deal of the land yet floats high above the sea in that unnatural way...
7810 : Once the people of Tavnazia have regained their strength and spirit, we will rebuild the Marquisate and reclaim our lives.
7811 : No longer shall our homes be overrun by monsters.
7812 : Sure, the dragons are gone, but we've still got a lot of work to do.
7813 : And don't you give me that sympathetic look. You adventurers will have plenty of opportunities to pitch in.
7814 : You must not give in to the lure of battle, Prishe.
7815 : We need you to focus on becoming the leader of the Tavnazian Cathedral.
7816 : Wha--!? I'm off to get my workout!
7817 : Later!
7818 : Prishe...!
7819 : When I dwell on events, it seems we have done nothing but cause you trouble.
7820 : And yet you have stood by us through it all. We are truly grateful.
7821 : And should the opportunity arise, we would greatly appreciate any further assistance you could provide for the Marquisate.
7822 : However... I understand that as an adventurer, there is still much in the world you wish to experience.
7823 : If you ever feel the need to rest your wings, we will always welcome you here in Tavnazia.
7824 : I hope we may meet again, %.
7825 : Hey, you found me!
7826 : Have you been here before, %? You can see for malms.
7827 : You can get a great view of the town where I was born--where the end of the world was born.
7828 : All I've ever thought about is what the apocalypse would be like.
7829 : If I manage to live out this eternal life, I guess I'll eventually find out.
7830 : It doesn't matter how--the rebirth of Promathia; the awakening of the sleeping gods; the victory of the beastmen.
7831 : The world will end. And when that happens, even my immortal existence will be snuffed out.
7832 : When I stood before that gate, Promathia promised to show me the apocalypse.
7833 : That was when I realized who most wanted to see the end of it all--who couldn't wait for the grand finale.
7834 : That person was me.
7835 : That's why I hurled that black magicite into the Twilight God.
7836 : I somehow hoped that by sending it into the mothercrystal with the soul of Promathia, the Keeper of the Apocalypse would one day rise again.
7837 : Miss Mildaurion didn't yell at me.
7838 : She just smiled and said, Wait until you meet [him/her].
7839 : What did she mean? Is your hatred of me meant to be my punishment?
7840 : Do you think so? Nod. Shake your head.
7841 : I thought so. That must be why I hurt inside.
7842 : No, really. That must be why I hurt inside.
7843 : Why now? I've been the target of a lot of abuse over the years, and it's never bothered me.
7844 : But for some reason, you just standing there quietly is more than I can bear.
7845 : And it's not like being kicked, or punched, or stabbed.
7846 : I can't get a handle on it. It's frightening and unnerving. I feel like I'm gonna be sick.
7847 : You're just a mortal, right?
7848 : Then how can you close your heart off to me?
7849 : Are you sad? Do I make you sad?
7850 : Is it too difficult? Am I too difficult to deal with?
7851 : Don't you want to open your heart to me?
7852 : What the hell is this feeling? What the hell is going on...?
7853 : You and I feel the same way. That's why I can't read you. We share the same soul.
7854 : No, it's not that I can't read you, it's because I've become the same as you...
7855 : The magicite in my chest... It's gone...
7856 : Has my magicite...melted away...?
7857 : I know what's happened... I've gotten it back...
7858 : The thing that makes us mortal... The Emptiness...
7859 : I'm mortal again. That's why I feel so much pain.
7860 : ...Damn. Being mortal sure is complicated.
7861 : I'm in pain, but I'm happy.
7862 : It hurts, but I can smile.
7863 : That's why I can tell you from the depths of my being...
7864 : Thank you, %.
7865 : I can go on now.
7866 : Not simply wait for the end, but be just like everyone else...
7867 : ...and truly live.
7868 : Press any button to continue.
7869 : You find nothing out of the ordinary.
7870 : Today is your lucky day!
7871 : You sense that your lucky color may bring you fortune.
7872 : You are too far away to participate in the Voidwatch operation.
7873 : You are currently engaged elsewhere and cannot participate in the Voidwatch operation.
7874 : You are unconscious and cannot participate in the Voidwatch operation.

7883 : You have # [minute/minutes] (Earth time) remaining to complete the battle.
7884 : You have only # [second/seconds] (Earth time) remaining.
7885 : Your time for this battle is up...
7886 : The monster fades before your eyes, a look of disappointment on its face.
7887 : Temporary item: % is available for use!
7888 : All temporary items are recharged!
7889 : You feel a mysterious energy seeping forth from an unknown source...
7890 : The % resonates with the %. You may commence the Voidwatch operation at will.
7891 : A Voidwatch operation could be initiated if only you had % and %...
7892 : However, your presence does not seem to elicit a reaction.
7893 : What will you do? Nothing. Initiate Voidwatch operation. View alignment values. Examine atmacite. Read up on the Voidwatch.
7894 : Use %? Yes. No.
7895 : You do not possess the % necessary to initiate a Voidwatch operation here.
7896 : A fiend materializes from the planar rift!
7897 : Current Spectral Alignment Blue: +#% (reward quantity) Red: +#% (reward quality)
7898 : Yellow: +#% (experience yield) Green: +#% (cruor yield)
7899 : Alignment bonuses granted by ascent items will be added to the final value.
7900 : You can infuse up to # atmacite at this time.
7901 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (Lv.#) Infused: % (Lv.#) Infused: % (Lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.

7920 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
7921 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
7922 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
7923 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
7924 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
7925 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
7926 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
7927 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
7928 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
7929 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
7930 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
7931 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
7932 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
7933 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
7934 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
7935 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
7936 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
7937 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
7938 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
7939 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
7940 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
7941 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
7942 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
7943 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
7944 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
7945 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
7946 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
7947 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
7948 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
7949 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
7950 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
7951 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
7952 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
7953 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
7954 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
7955 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
7956 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
7957 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
7958 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
7959 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
7960 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
7961 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
7962 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
7963 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
7964 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
7965 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%
7966 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%
