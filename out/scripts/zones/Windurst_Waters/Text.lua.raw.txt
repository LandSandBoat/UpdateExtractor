6745 : Accept this mission? Yes. No.
6746 : You have accepted the mission.
6747 : (DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!
6748 : Welcome, Master! This is your home, the Mog House, kupo!
6749 : I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!
6750 : I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!
6751 : First, the basics, kupo! Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to Mog House when you're in your Mog House, kupo!
6752 : Press it and the Mog House menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
6753 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
6754 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
6755 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
6756 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
6757 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
6758 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
6759 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
6760 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
6761 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
6762 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
6763 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
6764 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
6765 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
6766 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
6767 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
6768 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
6769 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
6770 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
6771 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
6772 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!
6773 : It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!
6774 : You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!
6775 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
6776 : Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
6777 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
6778 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
6779 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
6780 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
6781 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
6782 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
6783 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
6784 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
6785 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
6786 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
6787 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
6788 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
6789 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
6790 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
6791 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
6792 : It's all yours, kupo!
6793 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!
6794 : Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
6795 : I found this item in the back of one of the %'s drawers, kupo!
6796 : It's all yours, kupo!
6797 : I found this in the back of the %, kupo!
6798 : It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo! Here, take it, kupo!
6799 : I found this item inside the %, kupo!
6800 : Luck is on your side, kupo! Take it, kupo!
6801 : I fished this item out of the %, kupo!
6802 : It was very hard work, kupo... I'm very tired, kupo...
6803 : I found this behind the % painting, kupo!
6804 : This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6805 : Something clattered inside the % when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
6806 : It's all yours, kupo!
6807 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
6808 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6809 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
6810 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
6811 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
6812 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
6813 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
6814 : Each item of furniture you place using the Layout command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
6815 : When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!

6820 : TEST-No.#
6821 : I found % inside the %, kupo!
6822 : Kupo...? I sense that this % is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!
6823 : Master! Master! Look what I found underneath the % this morning, kupo!
6824 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
6825 : Look what I found in your %!
6826 : You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it. I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!
6827 : Your Mog Locker lease is valid until #/#/# #:#:#, kupo.
6828 : The lease on your Mog Locker has expired, kupo. Please trade % to me or to Fubruhn in Aht Urhgan Whitegate.
6829 : Your Mog Locker lease has been extended until #/#/# #:#:#, kupo!
6830 : Master, Master! I found this in the %, kupo!
6831 : It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
6832 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
6833 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
6834 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
6835 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
6836 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
6837 : Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
6838 : Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
6839 : We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
6840 : Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
6841 : Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your %, when this % just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
6842 : Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6843 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6844 : Look at what I found while cleaning out the %: %!
6845 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6847 : It all began with a raindrop,      or so the legend says...
6848 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
6849 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
6850 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
6851 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
6852 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
6853 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
6854 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
6855 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
6856 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
6857 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
6858 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
6859 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
6860 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
6861 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
6862 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
6863 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...
6864 : Do something? Read instructions. Change parameters. Teleport to key locations. Warp to home point. Receive items. Obtain 100,000,000 gil. Do nothing.
6865 : Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
6866 : But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!
6867 : Furthermore, you may trade a moogle storage slip to me to wipe it clean, or mystically entrust its entire contents to me. Quite convenient, wouldn't you say?

6908 : The hallowed halls of your house are even more exciting! Why? Because now there's a second floor, kupo!
6909 : But before you bash your way in, I've got a trifling task for you to tackle.
6910 : Capricious Mithra cubs have cajoled critical information out of the M.H.M.U., and I want you to wrest it from them!
6911 : Visit the three nations and question them, kupo!
6912 : Now you know the nitty-gritty, so enjoy your new floor, kupo!
6913 : Kupopo? You mean you already know?
6914 : Magnificent and marvelous! Then proceed without delay!
6915 : Enjoy extra space to store your sundries!
6916 : Remodel your room to fit your finicky tastes!
6917 : Incorporate ostentatious overseas objects! All this and more!
6918 : But only on the second floor, kupo. I like the first floor as it is.
6919 : And as for your potted plants--they only persevere on the ground, kupo.
6920 : And moghancement effects only activate for furnishings fitted to the first floor.
6921 : Wish we could help more, but we spend enormous amounts of energy on one floor already!
6922 : Go forth and frolic in your new abode, kupo!
6923 : You can access the antechambers from the front door. Enjoy!
6924 : % might bring a certain je ne sais quoi to your Mog House, kupo!
6925 : Ah, I never thought that this day would come, kupo...
6926 : Indeed, it seems like just yesterday that we first met here.
6927 : I have watched with wonder as you grew before my very eyes, kupo.
6928 : In fact, I heard many tales of your boundless bravery from my friends across the world.
6929 : Every time, it made me feel much like a proud parent would.
6930 : It was like I was right there with you, kupo.
6931 : That is why I ceaselessly cleaned your Mog House, merrily managed your belongings, and watered your plants.
6932 : I couldn't really think of any other ways to help you, kupo.
6933 : However, I heard about the trials and tribulations that you've been through.
6934 : Valhalla, the Maelstrom Mage, Chaos...
6935 : Kupopopo! Now I can actually assist you!
6936 : It is time for us to joyfully join forces, kupo!
6937 : We can discuss details at the stone circle in the La Theine Plateau! I'll be waiting for you there, kupo!
6938 : You go on ahead, and we'll see each other soon!
6939 : Oh, so you want %, do you? Well, that's usually reserved for my regular patrons...
6940 : But if you simply must have it, then bring me %!
6941 : % can be obtained from the queen crawler in the Crawlers' Nest, but it is quite hard to come by via merchants. If it means getting my hands on some of it, then it's worth the trade!
6942 : Oh, my! You actually managed to get your hands on %!? Well, looks like I'll be giving you % in order to keep my half of the deal then, doesn't it?

7196 : Create a new contract with us? Immediately. Not today.
7197 : Are you certain? I said, Immediately. On second thought...
7198 : You have terminated your trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7199 : Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.
7200 : If you happen to create a high quality version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.
7201 : Trading us these items will earn you guild points which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.
7202 : The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.
7203 : When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.
7204 : I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.
7205 : If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.
7206 : You have formed a new trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7207 : The current requested item is %. You have # guild points accumulated.
7208 : Currently, no items are being requested by the guild. You have # guild points accumulated.
7209 : Is there something you need? I'm just passing through. I would like to use my points. What are the current limits? How does the trade system work?
7210 : You have # more days (Vana'diel time) to provide us with the requested item.
7211 : Today (Vana'diel time) is the final day we will accept the requested item.
7212 : You can still receive up to # guild points by trading us the item before the time limit is up.
7213 : You are not eligible to receive guild points at this time.
7214 : Exchange points for... Nothing. A high-quality crystal. Analysis crystals. % (1500). % (#). % (70000). % (100000). % (150000). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). A key item.

7227 : You are a registered craftsman at the following guild(s): [/Carpenters' ][/Blacksmiths' ][/Goldsmiths' ][/Weavers' ][/Tanners' ][/Boneworkers' ][/Alchemists' ][/Culinarians' ] By revoking your status, you will be reduced to journeyman and your synthesis skills will be adjusted accordingly.
7228 : Proceed? Yes. No.
7229 : Your craftsman status at the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild has been revoked.
7230 : Which rank of synthesis do you ask about? Never mind. Amateur. Recruit. Initiate. Novice. Apprentice. Journeyman. Craftsman. Artisan. Adept. Veteran. Expert. Authority. Luminary. Master. Grandmaster.
7231 : Which synthesis recipe do you ask about? None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. View more recipes.
7232 : Renounce your rank at which guild? None. Carpenters'. Blacksmiths'. Goldsmiths'. Weavers'. Tanners'. Boneworkers'. Alchemists'. Culinarians'.
7233 : If you proceed, your rank in the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild will return to that of [craftsman/artisan/adept], and your skill value will revert to the maximum for that level. This procedure cannot be undone, so please consider your decision carefully.
7234 : Renounce your rank as a [Carpenter/Blacksmith/Goldsmith/Weaver/Tanner/Boneworker/Alchemist/Culinarian]? No, retain. Yes, renounce.
7235 : You have successfully renounced your status as a [craftsman/artisan/adept] of the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7236 : Huh? Have I met you before? This is the Culinarians' Guild. As you can guess, it is an association for professional cooks.
7237 : I understand you not wanting to rush into anything. As you can see, we have to keep a clean kitchen, so it's not the kind of place unauthorized people should hang about in.
7238 : Well, it's done, then! Lately, a lot of adventurers have been signing up to learn. Here. Study a little crystal synthesis with this...
7239 : To put it simply, crystals are solidified energy. Crystal synthesis utilizes that energy to cook individual ingredients into a finished dish.
7240 : But it's not as easy as it looks. If the cook can't visualize the finished product properly, he could fail, wasting all the ingredients in the process.
7241 : So you need to gain as much practice as possible. Only the cook who understands the very essence of his ingredients can make truly exquisite cuisine.
7242 : Start with the basics and gradually build yourself up. If you need the recipes, your fellow guildsmen can tell you how to make delicacies from all around the world.
7243 : People have to eat every day, and you do not have to be a connoisseur to judge what tastes good. So the ones who provide the food for them have to keep on improving their skills, or the diner will go elsewhere.
7244 : How have you been? To tell you the truth, when I see your face, my mouth starts watering and my stomach starts talking... Are you going to make anything for us today?
7245 : It's about time you moved on to the next culinarian level. Here then...  Whip me up %.
7246 : If it tastes good and is presented well, I'll teach you some new cooking techniques.
7247 : Hmm... It's quite well done. I shall acknowledge you as [an amateur/a recruit/an initiate/a novice/an apprentice]! Good work! But remember, don't neglect the basics if you want to improve.
7248 : Oh... Now this is delicious! I shall acknowledge you as a journeyman! Ha, perhaps we should get you to teach at our ladies' society cooking school!?
7249 : ......Most incredible! I am delighted to acknowledge you as an artisan! Why, you should open your own restaurant!
7250 : ... Your hard work and toil have finally paid off! I present you with the title of adept! Let us live the joy of cooking together!
7251 : There aren't enough words in the Tarutaru language to describe the exquisite flavor of this scrumptious dish! You've got to tell me what you put in this!
7252 : Oh, look...! You made me mix the wrong quantities. If there's something you want, ask the bigwig standing over there.
7253 : Hey, didn't we just give you some help a second ago? Trying to double up, eh? Well it won't work, so there!
7254 : Hey, you don't have enough gil. You're just like that guy. He was always trying to get help off'a me for free.
7255 : Alright then, close your eyes...
7256 : I think you'd make a good %, if you tried. Here, it's easy...
7257 : Remember all I've told you and you'll go far. Unless you want to go make all kinds of fancy-wancy creative cooking and ruin the traditions we've tried hard to maintain, like someone we all know...
7258 : Excuse my ill manners, but I've got my hands full. If there's something you want, ask the master chef.
7259 : Begging your pardon, but didn't we just help you a minute ago?
7260 : You don't possess enough gil, I'm afraid. This would cost you even more in San d'Oria and Bastok, by the way. Both the ingredients and wages are higher there.
7261 : Now you're cooking! Don't be shy now. Look into my eyes...
7262 : Hmm... Maybe you'd like to try making %? So jot down my recipe or commit it to memory if you're so inclined.
7263 : There you have it. Come back and ask again if you forget it, alright?
7264 : I'm sorry, but could you please not bother me? You might make me slip up.
7265 : I don't believe you need any assistance right now.
7266 : Sorry, but I can see you don't have enough gil. Perhaps you're a castaway who finally made it back to dry land, and now needs money to get home? Right...that's the oldest line in the book.
7267 : Clear your mind and meditate...
7268 : With your current culinary skills, I believe % is about your cup of tea...
7269 : Practice makes perfect, so apply yourself to your studies everyday.
7270 : I think that you are ready to enter the leagues of the great chefs. Mix me up %.
7271 : If it tickles my tongue, I'll grant you the title of craftsman.
7272 : But you must be forewarned. Becoming a craftsman of the Culinary Guild means a certain level of devotion to the culinary arts.
7273 : You are free to become a craftsman in another guild, but if doing so means losing that knack you have for cooking...
7274 : ...Delicioso! The title of culinary craftsman is as good as yours! You are now a true chef.
7275 : Oh, and don't forget to keep practicing. Spend too much time honing your other skills, and you're likely to forget everything I've taught you!
7276 : % is a special technique used by famous chefs in the Eastern Empire. I wouldn't lay a finger on a piece of sushi that hadn't been made by a culinary artist with this ability.
7277 : % is a special technique used by chefs to turn ordinary flour and water into all different types of pasta used in all sorts of delectable dishes!
7278 : % is a special technique used by chefs to create all sorts of delicious sweets! I'll be happy to work as your tast-tester...
7279 : % is a special technique used by chefs in the Eastern Empire to create amazing stewpots that everyone can enjoy!
7280 : Oh, %. How have you been? You haven't let your stainless steel cooking skills start to rust, have you?
7281 : I heard from some of my acquaintances that you've become a craftsman at another guild. While I can appreciate your yearning to be a jack-of-all-trades, I am disappointed at your choice not to focus on perfecting your cooking skills.
7282 : The culinary arts is a delicate field. A lack of focus could ruin a whole meal--flatten a whole soufle!
7283 : That is why I warn you. If you truly want to become a master chef, you should revoke your craftsman skill status at all other guilds and concentrate on cooking, cooking, and more cooking!
7284 : Revoke all other craftsman statuses? Right away. Hold on!
7285 : Wonderful! I can feel the flames of your heart's oven! Don't worry about contacting the other guilds. I'll notify the proper guildmasters about your decision.
7286 : I realize the decision is a difficult one, but if you wish to truly master any one thing, there are some sacrifices that cannot be avoided.
7287 : The synthesis items for that rank are still beyond your skill, I'm afraid.
7288 : Our [veteran/expert/authority/luminary/master] chef returns! I hear your culinary creations are all the rage across town these days. What say you apply a fine garnish to your skills, that you might lead the realm into a new era of epicurean delights?
7289 : Hone your skills further? Certainly! Maybe later...
7290 : Now that's a scrumptious answer! First, you'll be wanting to acquire a copy of % from Qhum Knaidjn.
7291 : You'll need a dash of guild points for the transaction, but a chef of your skills should need only a pinch of effort to accrue them.
7292 : What is this foul taste in my mouth? Why, I believe it's my bitter disappointment at the potential you're allowing to go to waste.
7293 : First, you'll want to speak to Qhum Knaidjn and obtain yourself %.
7294 : You're back, and the smile on your face tells me that you've fully digested the contents of %.
7295 : Very well, then! Wash your hands, put on your chef's hat, and whip me up %. First you'll have to hunt down the ingredients, of course, a task which I doubt will be as easy as pamama pie.
7296 : Ah, and don't forget to decorate your dish with your signature, that I and my fellow gourmets will know who to thank for the mouthwatering meal.
7297 : You forgot the recipe for %? I don't like repeating myself, so be sure to write it down in your cookbook.
7298 : Splendid! Marvelous! Spectacular! Why, it's been years since I've tasted such a mouthwatering dish! I hereby bestow upon you the rank of expert, and give you my explicit permission to look down your nose at all the faux gourmands around you!
7299 : An admirable attempt, yet it lacks a certain...something. Ah, your signature! Do you find your dish so lacking in flavor and pizazz that you are unwilling to take credit for it?
7300 : No, I'm afraid this won't do at all...but you didn't need me to tell you that. Back to the cutting board for you. Chop chop!
7301 : I think that you are ready to enter the leagues of the great chefs. Mix me up %.
7302 : If it tickles my tongue, I'll grant you the title of [artisan/adept/veteran].
7303 : But you must be forewarned. Becoming [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] of the Culinary Guild means a certain level of devotion to the culinary arts.
7304 : You are free to become [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in another guild, but if doing so means losing that knack you have for cooking...
7305 : Ah, yes. And while we cannot prevent you from becoming [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in another guild, I warn you that too much time spent on non-culinary pursuits may cause irreparable harm to your refined palate.
7306 : Is it true that you've achieved the rank of [artisan/adept/veteran] in a guild other than our own? I must say, %, this leaves a terribly bad taste in my mouth.
7307 : A chef must be first and foremost a chef. Waste too much time on idle pursuits and your tarts will lose their tang, your stews their savor!
7308 : Luckily, there is still time to do right by your taste buds. Say the word and I can revoke your [artisan/adept/veteran] status in any lesser guilds.
7309 : It is simply a matter of my calling the guildmaster and informing them of your desire to focus on your culinary pursuits. So what do you say, %?
7310 : Ah, %. To think that I shall never again know the gustatory bliss that is one of your scrumptious %! It brings a tear to my eye...
7311 : Forgive me. I have no doubt that you will be a scrumptious success in whatever profession you choose to follow. Be well, %.
7312 : I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...
7313 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
7314 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
7315 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7316 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7317 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7318 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7319 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7320 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7321 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7322 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7323 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7324 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7325 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7326 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7327 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7328 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7329 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7330 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7331 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7332 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7333 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7334 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7335 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7336 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7337 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7338 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
7339 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
7340 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
7341 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.
7342 : A mysterious power absorbs the malice!
7343 : Please select absorption value. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
7362 : Humph. Sorry, but we don't have a hat to suit you right now.
7363 : Perhaps if you grew a smarter head we could find you a smarter hat!
7364 : Are you interested in hats, my dear?
7365 : Tarutaru simply must wear hats. We have to protect our beautiful heads, you know?
7366 : A hat may seem to be a simple garment, but it has the right to select the one who will wear it.
7367 : As we in the business say...   If the wearer fits, hat it.
7368 : For many long years I've been friends with Bondada, that customer over there. We've chatted over tea, but we can never seem to agree on anything.
7369 : A good hat doesn't hide the wearer--it expresses the very essence of the wearer.
7370 : They say that there are stars in the heavens that wear hats. They're far better dressers than we could ever be!
7371 : Hey, you'll do! You have just the right appearance.
7372 : I'd like you to take my latest creation and show it off around the whole of Windurst Waters.
7373 : How about it? I'll make it worth your while. Care to try your hand at the exciting new field of headwear advertising?
7374 : By the way, do you want to give the hat advertising gig another go?
7375 : Advertise the hatter's wares? Give it a go. Decline.
7376 : That's the problem with young people today... They give in at the drop of a hat! Come back when you're ready to help both me and yourself!
7377 : A mad rush, or mediocre sales... It all depends on how well you show off this model!
7378 : Be sure to talk to any potential customers you see! If it goes well, I'll give you a small percentage of the sales.
7379 : Oh, and please limit your advertising to Windurst Waters. We must focus our efforts in this one area! Understand?
7380 : If you see a potential customer, go ahead and converse with him or her as you show off my hat. People who appreciate fine headwear will surely have their interests aroused.
7381 : I have a bet with that customer, Bondada, over how many orders we'll get from the people in this area today.
7382 : Take that hat and walk around Windurst Waters with it. Try and attract as much attention as possible by talking to people.
7383 : Fashion tastes change, so each style of hat has a limited time and area of appeal. It's better if you stay in Windurst Waters and focus your efforts here. You got it?
7384 : You seem pretty confident there, my dear. We'll see if you're just talking through your hat. Windurstians have some strange tastes in apparel, you know.
7385 : Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that tile? Isn't it a nobby one, and just the proper style? I should like to have one just the same as that...
7386 : Hello, where did you get that hat? ......... Is that a new one of Baren-Moren's? Hmm. I'm quite taken by it.
7387 : Hrmmmm...!? Nice hat...  Shame it doesn't suit you, though.
7388 : Hrmm...  Maybe it'll suit me? As I always say... If the hat fits, wear it!
7389 : Hmm...? Huhummm...?
7390 : What a strange piece of headwear! Where can one obtain such a fashion statement?
7391 : A new style from the local milliner, Baren-Moren? Not that I would ever entertain the thought of wearing Tarutaru apparel, of course. But perhaps I could purchase one as a conversation piece for back home.
7392 : Huh...?
7393 : There's something different about you compared to the other adventurers.
7394 : What is that hat you're holding? Let me have a look.
7395 : Hmm...this must be the latest style from the local hatter. It's about time I had some new headwear made. Perhaps I'll drop by later...
7396 : Wait right there! Hey, I said wait!
7397 : That hat you have there...it must be the latest style by that mad hatter.
7398 : Okay, now that I know there's a new type of hat available, I have no need for you. Make yourself scarce, kid!
7399 : Munch-munch...gloomph...bellllch! That is an intriguing hat you have there!
7400 : Hey, that could make a great story! Thanks, that's my scoop of the day!
7401 : Ho-hohohoho! You're trying to make me buy another-wother hat? That's like preaching to the converted.
7402 : Alright then... I'll buy just one more.
7403 : Ho-hohohoho! I didn't buy it for the hat itself. I bought it to show appreciation for your efforts...perhaps?
7404 : Hang your hat up? Not yet. Yes. Done.
7405 : If you're throwing in the hat, then I'm taking it back from you.
7406 : Hey, you didn't seem to do any work at all. You have the impudence to ask for a wage for that? What do you think I am, a charity?
7407 : There'll be no passing the hat around here! Get out of here, you slacker!
7408 : That didn't go very well at all. I didn't get a single inquiry, let alone an order.
7409 : Anyway, here's a little pocket money for your limited effort, bad hat. Don't spend it all at once.
7410 : It's not my workmanship that's the problem. It's my poor choice of hired help! Why did I ever bother asking you?
7411 : A few orders have trickled in, but nothing like I had expected. This style should have caught on like wildfire.
7412 : Anyway, here's your pocket money. Don't spend it all at once.
7413 : I guess that's what happens when you ask an amateur to do your advertising. I had better go put on my thinking cap...
7414 : That's a lot of orders we've had. My new style of hat is so charming, it's a crime!
7415 : You've earned yourself quite a hefty cut of the sales, young'un. Watch you don't get cat burgled! I'll also give you one of my hats for good measure.
7416 : Both my workmanship and my skill in selecting hired help are spot on! I won the wager. That'll make Bondada eat her hat.
7417 : I take my hat off to you. Why, I even have orders coming in from other countries! I don't know what you did, but it worked wonders.
7418 : Your talent in advertising is almost as brilliantaru as my talent in hatmaking. Here, take the hat as a reward.
7419 : You seem to have a sense of business there, young'un. Perhaps you should wear two hats, and take up advertising as a side job to your adventuring?
7420 : Come back to this shop when you have the time, and train yourself to become a hat connoisseur.
7421 : Ho-hohohoho! Too true, too true.
7422 : Ho-hohohoho! You did well, my dear. I'd throw my hat into the air if we weren't indoors.
7423 : Ho-hohohoho! I rather enjoyed that little bet I had with Baren-Moren over you.
7424 : Ho-hohohoho! Baren-Moren has a bee in his bonnet!
7425 : I'm in a bit of a fix... but it doesn't concern you.
7426 : If you're not here to buy one of my hats, then hurry up and leave.
7427 : I'm in a bit of a fix... Would you be so good as to hear me out...?
7428 : Some big-wigged madam wants me to make her a particularly luxurious hat... Arrrgh!
7429 : I'm reluctant, as my hats aren't just for appearance's sake.
7430 : Ho-hohohoho! You're just saying that, Baren-Moren, because you don't know what luxurious means!
7431 : I already told you, Bondada, I can make something as simple as a grande dame's hat with my eyes shut.
7432 : That's it! Hey, %! Want to help me out here?
7433 : Help make the lady's luxurious hat? Give it a try. Decline.
7434 : Why you...! You just came here to see me wear a dunce's cap too, didn't you?
7435 : I'm going to need feathers... Lots of big feathers! How about you get me three % from the monsters that live on the Meriphataud Mountains and Sauromugue Champaign?
7436 : Now you know what I need, so hurry up and get them!
7437 : Hurry up and get me those feathers! I'll make that woman eat her hat!
7438 : Well done. You were able to get all I needed.
7439 : That caps off this story! Here, this should pay for your efforts.
7440 : Prepare yourself, Bondada! I'll show you what a luxurious hat is!
7441 : Ho-hohohoho! You're one fine feather... Fine feather, indeed.
7442 : A little while ago, Barrren-Morrren asked Bondada what she wanted as a gift.
7443 : Those two always seem to be fighting and putting each otherrr down, but deep down they rrreally like one anotherrr.
7444 : Remember that luxurious hat I was making? Well, it seems that I don't have enough plumage.
7445 : Would you be so good as to help me out again? Then you can help me ruffle Bondada's feathers.
7446 : I need three more % that you can pluck from the monsters on the Sauromugue Champaign and Meriphataud Mountains.
7447 : So hurry up and plucking get me those feathers!
7448 : Who, me? I'm like, Angelica, the painter. You know, like, it's a pleasure, I'm sure...
7449 : You're, how do I say...? Close, but not close enough? Like...you're missing that certain factor, right. Umm, like, you know?
7450 : Well I suppose you could call it, like...a feeling. Yeah, a feeling, you know? Like when you meet that certain someone... You know what I'm saying, right?
7451 : I have to paint as many pictures as I can before I, like, leave this hostelry, you know?
7452 : Like, this hostelry will one day be famous as the place where I spent my formative years perfecting my unique style, right?
7453 : The old lady downstairs has been soooo kind to me, like, I really want to pay her back somehow... What should I do?
7454 : Hey, you there, kind [sir!/miss!] Like, hold on a tick...
7455 : Oh my Goddess! You're, like, totally perfect for this hazily vague image I have in my head for my next painting, you know?
7456 : Oh, you simply must model for my next masterpiece.
7457 : Model for Angelica's picture? Like, for sure... Like, as if...?
7458 : Your nobility is essential for the feel of this scenario I have, my pointy-eared friend.
7459 : Could you please, like, model for my next masterpiece?
7460 : Your muscular physique is essential for the feel of this scenario I have, my brutish friend.
7461 : Could you please, like, model for my next masterpiece, already?
7462 : Your daintiness is essential for the feel of this scenario I have, my halfling friend.
7463 : Could you please, like, model-wodel for my next masterpiecey-wiecey?
7464 : Your potential is essential for the feel of this scenario I have, my fellow Hume.
7465 : Could you please, like, model for my next masterpiece?
7466 : Your feisty femininity is essential for the feel of this scenario I have, my feline friend.
7467 : Could you please, like, model for my next masterpiece?
7468 : Oh my Goddess! You can't understand art when you see it, can you? Like, you're lower than the lowest tunnel worm.
7469 : That's the spirit! Like, I knew you'd come through!
7470 : Stand over there.
7471 : Oh, no! Like, my Goddess...
7472 : This is, like, totally imperfecto! You're missing that certain something, you know...?
7473 : Hmm... %!
7474 : That's it! I can't do without it. Go equip yourself with % and come back here.
7475 : Hmm... %!
7476 : That's it! I can't do without it. Go equip yourself with % and come back here.
7477 : Hmm... %!
7478 : That's it! I can't do without it. Go equip yourself with % and come back here.
7479 : Hmm... %!
7480 : That's it! I can't do without it. Go equip yourself with % and come back here.
7481 : Hmm... %!
7482 : That's it! I can't do without it. Go equip yourself with % and come back here.
7483 : Hmm... %!
7484 : That's it! I can't do without it. Go equip yourself with % and come back here.
7485 : But don't keep me waiting too long, right? I don't know how long I can keep this image in my head. So, like, hurry up already!
7486 : I can't start without you wearing one of those. Like, hurry up and go equip yourself with one and get back here.
7487 : Your image is, like, sooo five minutes ago. Like, I don't need your help anymore.
7488 : Sooorry, but it's, like, unavoidable. My flashes of inspiration change as fast as Tarutaru hat fashions, right? I have to, like, keep up with the latest trends, you know.
7489 : Oh, like, what kept you? But, anyway, I'm glad you got back before I, like, lost the image I was keeping in my head.
7490 : So, like, let's get on with it already. Stand over there, right?
7491 : Give me more passion. Oh yeah! Oh yeah!!! That's it! Ooooh yeah!
7492 : Now give me a little ennui. Ennui... Ennnnuuuiiii!!!
7493 : ......
7494 : Phew... Heehee. I guess that about does it. Here. I'll give you this portrait as a momento.
7495 : Phew... Heehee. I guess that about does it.
7496 : As a bonus I'll also give you my autograph, right? In the near future, you'll be able to, like, fetch a fortune for it.
7497 : Phew... I did some good work today.
7498 : I know it's, like, strange to say it myself, but...this is a work after my own heart.
7499 : I was able to, like, make another fine piece of art, so here... Take this as a reward for your help.
7500 : Phew... I was able to do some good work again, today. Like, now I'm all hot and sweaty. Guess that's the 99% perspiration to go with my inspiration. Just goes to show that I'm a genius, right?
7501 : Would you, like, model for me...not!? No way, Jose! I was going to ask, but on closer inspection...
7502 : You're, you're, you're...devoid of inspiration, banal, plain, monotone, run-of-the-mill, commonplace, ordinary, oh, so average...and like, sooo five minutes ago! Humph!
7503 : This is the north gatehouse of Windurst. If you're in need of a map of Windurst, head south to the Port District.
7504 : I heard a Mithra lady-wady was selling magic maps near the shops along the wharves there.
7505 : You look new to these parts. I guess we should introduce ourselves to each other-wother. This is the north gatehouse, and we're the guards whose duty it is to protect Windurst.
7506 : Huh? You have some kind of business with us, the North Winds? Mokyokyo is our leader-weader, so speak to her first.
7507 : Oh, a foreigner, huh? If you're looking for the [San d'Orian/Bastokan] Consulate, then head [yonder southeast/south]... It's in [Windurst Woods/Port Windurst]. Ta-taru.

7510 : If you're a citizen of Windurst, then pleasey-weasey sign up for your first mission here! We're having a bet with the other gatehouses over who can gainy-wainy the most new recruits.
7511 : ERROR: SAYING A MASKED ANSWER!
7512 : You cannot accept more than one mission at a timey-wimey. Please complete your current mission before applying for the next.
7513 : I shall now read out the missions you are able to receive...
7514 : Which mission will you accept? The Horutoto Ruins Experiment. The Heart of the Matter. The Price of Peace. Lost for Words. A Testing Time. The Three Kingdoms. Mission 2-3-1A. Mission 2-3-1B. Mission 2-3-2A. Mission 2-3-2B. To Each His Own Right. Written in the Stars. A New Journey. Magicite. The Final Seal. The Shadow Awaits. Full Moon Fountain. Saintly Invitation. The Sixth Ministry.

7515 : Was Miss Apururu well?
7516 : If Miss Apururu is well, then I'm happy-wappy.
7517 : If there's something you don't understand, just ask Jack of Hearts for a hand. You can find him in the plaza in fronty-wonty of the Optistery.
7518 : And even then, if you still don't understand something, pluck up the courage and ask your fellow adventurers for advice.
7519 : tHIsiS tHenOrTh gATeHOusE!tEn AMa CArDiANaSsiGNed tO tHe NOrTh WInDsgUaRds!
7520 : Can you stand on your own two feetsy-weetsy as an adventurer yet?
7521 : If so, then you should help out other new adventurers. Kindness is the most whooper-dooper magic that anyone can use.
7522 : The four gatehouses are competing over who can get the most new recruits. I wonder how it's going.
7523 : I bet we North Winds are winning!
7524 : Hello there. Welcome to the North Winds.
7525 : Have you checked out the rest of Windurst, yet? There are several gatehouses spread all over this city-wity.
7526 : This is the north gatehouse. Our group that gathers here at Odin's Gate goes by the name of the North Winds.
7527 : Huh? You don't know about gatehouses? Well, you're going to find the going tough if you don't learn soon. Want me to explainy-wainy...?
7528 : Hear the explanation? Yes, pleasey-weasey. No, thanky-hanky.
7529 : The gatehouses are meeting and resting points for us guards who protect Windurst.
7530 : They are also the places where missions from the Federation of Windurst are received and allocated to people.
7531 : When you receive a mission and successfully complete the task it involves, you will be awarded rank points.
7532 : Collect enough rank points, and your rank, or relative position in society, will rise.
7533 : At first you might only receive boring missions, but even those have their good side, allowing you to meet with people you would not normally be able to, and so on.
7534 : So how about it? Are you interested in serving your country? We really recommend you try them outy-wouty.
7535 : Receive a mission? Accept. Decline.
7536 : Don't need to hear the explanation, huh? Oh, so you consider yourself a scholar-wolar or something? Well we'll see about thatty-watty.
7537 : So how about it then? Try your hand out at a mission?
7538 : You're a citizen of Windurst, so you can receive missions here.
7539 : That's the spirit-wirit! Looks like it's my cue... I have a mission just right for you, so listen up!
7540 : You know the Horutoto Ruins out in Sarutabaruta, don't you? Well, they're about to conduct some kind of magic experiment there.
7541 : The Orastery, one of the five ministries of Windurst, is urgently requesting the dispatch of an adventurer to help them out.
7542 : Ask the Orastery's minister at their Mage Academy for the details.
7543 : The Orastery's Mage Academy is a big building in Port Windurst, far to the south of here. Well, good luck with your first tasky-wasky!
7544 : I guess there's no rushy-wushy. You'll be better prepared to complete your missions the more familiar you are with Windurst.
7545 : Come back when you feel ready-weady. We'll be waiting for you.
7546 : Oh my, oh why...? Well, that took the wind out of our sails...
7547 : I suppose you only just arrived in Windurst and want to see more of the area, so it's understandable. Come back when you're ready-weady.
7548 : Well then, hurry on over to the Orastery. It sounds like the Orastery is going to conduct some kind of magic experiment in the magic towers.
7549 : The Minister of the Orastery will explain the details.
7550 : Hmm... My first task was to clean up the garbage in Sarutabaruta. Thinking back now...boy, those days were peaceful!
7551 : Hurry on over to the Orastery. It's the big building in Port Windurst, far to the south of here.
7552 : Lucky you. Sounds like an exciting mission with that magic experiment going on. But, oh, I forgot! The Minister of the Orastery is THAT guy...
7553 : The Minister of the Orastery will tell you what the mission entails.
7554 : Now that you mention it, there's been an awful lot of these experiments going on lately. What is the Orastery up to this time?
7555 : hOrUtOtO RuInS... DaNgERoUspLaCE!
7556 : BAD cArDiaNslUrK iNsOMe PaRTs! beCArE-ful nOttO goTO WroNGplaCe!
7557 : Good to see you made it backy-wacky. Looks like you did well for your first task. We'll allocate you rank points according to our evaluation of your mission.
7558 : We look forward to you assisting us with our next task.
7559 : It might not feel like you're achieving much at firsty-wirsty, but your efforts are contributing to the peace of Windurst.
7560 : I'm sure my telling you that suddenly enthused you, didn't it?
7561 : Thank you for your continuing service. We hope you'll keep up the effort by helping us out with our next task.
7562 : ThAnK yOufOr yOuRpatRIOTism! YoU cOmPleTEdyoUR miSsIoNwElL aNdhAvE rEcEIvEdrAnk pOINts!

7564 : Your previous mission was the Orastery's magic experiment, right? Well then, this next tasky-wasky should be a piece of cake.
7565 : The Manustery is currently looking for an adventurer to help them in Cardian creation. Do you accept this mission?
7566 : Accept this mission? Accept. Decline.
7567 : Ask the staff at the Cardian workshop in the Manustery for the details of this mission.
7568 : Huh? You don't know where the Manustery is? Would you understand if I said it's near the round in Windurst Woods, the district where all those Mithra live?
7569 : The Manustery's Cardian workshop is southeast of here, in Windurst Woods.
7570 : To get to Windurst Woods, you have to pass through either Windurst Walls to the east, or Port Windurst to the south.
7571 : It's a long way to walk, but it's a good chance to get to know our country. Check your map to find the way, then consider it a leisurely strolly-wolly.
7572 : I can't hide the fact that I'm a big fan of Apururu from the Manustery!
7573 : She's always so nice and kindy-windy, never failing to show her shining smiley-wiley, despite her tragic past.
7574 : Listen here! You better complete Apururu's mission as fasty-wasty and as perfectly-werfectly as possible. Don't you dare mess up! You got it?
7575 : Cardians are our automaton guards. They were originally created twenty years ago by Zonpa-Zippa, the Minister of the Manustery.
7576 : It's hard enough to collect the materials to make them, but it takes even more effort to train them. Occasionally a few go bonkers-wonkers and run away...or that's what the guys from the Manustery say.
7577 : mOrEiNtElLiGEnt CArdiAnsbECoMe WInDUrsT'sTOwn GUarDs!STroNgercARdiaNS PATroloUtsIDe!

7580 : Have you become comfortable with performing missions yet?
7581 : Today, I'm thinking about asking you to do a very-wery important mission.
7582 : Your destination will be Giddeus. It's where the Yagudo beastmen dwell, on the other side of West Sarutabaruta.
7583 : Do you know much about the Yagudo? Windurst fought them in the war twenty years ago, but we currently maintain amicable relations.
7584 : As a sign of our friendship, we provide them with food offerings. That about sums up your mission-wission.
7585 : The Rhinostery prepares the food offerings. You can pick them up at the biological laboratory here at the south side of Windurst Waters.
7586 : Once you have received the food offerings from the researchers there, you should head straight to Giddeus.
7587 : I don't want you to get worked up about it, but this mission could affect the future of Windurst. It's that important!
7588 : Please be extremely careful!
7589 : First, head to the Rhinostery's biological laboratory here in the south of Windurst Waters.
7590 : Once you have received the food offerings from the researchers there, go straight to the food offering altars in Giddeus. Exercise the utmost caution-waution!
7591 : I know we shouldn't ask this, but... Why do we have to provide the Yagudo with all this stuff anyway?
7592 : The beastman hordes were utterly defeated by our allied forces in the war twenty years ago, weren't they? So what's the dealy-wealy?
7593 : Make no mistakey-wakeys! Although we're supposed to be on friendly terms with the Yagudo, Giddeus is still a dangerous dungeon.
7594 : Even if you explain that you're simply a messenger from Windurst, they'll say that they have to test you to determine the truth. Then they all start to attack you.
7595 : Of course, if you step in there without any real reason, they'll claim that you're encroaching on their sacred territory, and attack you in full force. They are most irritating.
7596 : THis MIsSiOniS VeRyiMpOrTaNt sOwHeN YoUfInIsh iTyOu cAnExPecT areWArd!
7597 : BuTdOn'T oVeRdoIT! yoU ONlyhAVe oNeLiFe! IfyOu GotOO fArYoU mAynEVeR rEtUrN!
7598 : What? Speak up! What's that you say? You're the help from the gatehouse, eh?
7599 : Wait right here, if you don't mind... I'll go get it, from out behind.
7600 : Here you go... Sorry for all the fuss. Today's offering for the altars of Giddeus.
7601 : In these bags are Yagudo's favorite cherries. These should give those ugly old beastmen their merries.
7602 : If you are wondering why there're now two bags, it's 'cause there're two altars in Giddeus's crags. A Yagudo by each altar stands. To each of them a bag you hand.
7603 : And though an offering you do bear, those Yagudo may attack you there. So take precautions, be prepared... Lest you return in states impaired!
7604 : The places where the altars of offering stand, are a little way into the Giddeus land. Before the entrances of the caves they are, so be careful not to venture in too far.
7605 : And though an offering you do bear, those Yagudo may attack you there. So be prepared and best of luck, unless you are a lucky...schmuck.
7606 : You're the adventurer who accepted our mission for today? Leepe-Hoppe has prepared the food offerings for you to take to Giddeus. He's waiting on the rooftop orchard right above us.
7607 : To get to the roof, go outside and take the stairs on the side of the building.
7608 : At first there was just one altar for offerings in Giddeus. So we only needed to take one bag of food.
7609 : Then one day, those sneaky Yagudo decided to build another altar. They are so greedy.
7610 : Food...bag...offering...
7611 : from...Culi...narians'...Guild...
7612 : has...juice...in...it...!
7613 : We of the Rhinostery would like to explore the underground canals too.
7614 : And investigate why the great beast disappeared after the war ceased.
7615 : But the entrance to the canals in Windurst Walls, has been off-limits for twenty years, 'spite our calls. Known only as the Priming Gate,  Cardians guard it as of late.
7616 : I know, I know. That's why I'm asking you for your cooperation.
7617 : Our objectives coincide... I'm in search of Karaha-Baruha's laboratory, and you're in search of the great beast's lair.
7618 : But opening the Priming Gate is no easy thing, the key is our Rhinostery minister's ring. And Minister Rukususu wouldn't to you lend, her ring even if you were really her friend.
7619 : You don't get what I'm saying. That's why I'm asking you!  Listen. On the night Rukususu comes back from the Northlands...
7620 : ...Let's continue this discussion later! Ta-taru!
7621 : Back from Giddeus now, I see! Your mission's done. What joy, what glee!
7622 : Oh, that was the Orastery minister, Ajido-Marujido, who wants to go to Karaha-Baruha's lab in the canals so...
7623 : So it really is the truth, what the rumors say... he's been asking about forbidden magic today.
7624 : I'm surprised he doesn't get caught without quibble, by Windurst's Sibyl Guards and the great Star Sibyl.
7625 : Anyway, your task's complete, your mission done, so return to the gatehouse where you begun.
7626 : Ha-ha! I'm sure something great, awaits you back at the gate!
7627 : Well, your task's complete, your mission done. Return to the gatehouse where you begun.
7628 : Ha-ha! I'm sure something great, awaits you back at the gate!
7629 : Well done. Relieved to see you made it back in one piecey-wiecey.
7630 : And congratulations are in order! You have successfully completed three missions, and have received enough rank points to go up in rank.
7631 : Now that you made rank two, you can participate in conquests. To find out more about conquests, ask one of the conquest guards.
7632 : You need to gain rank points by participating in conquests before you can receive any further missions.
7633 : Let's keep working together for the sake of Windurst.
7634 : You were able to deliver the goods to Giddeus, huh? Congratulations!  That means you're now rank two!
7635 : The higher-wigher you go up in rank, the harder-warder the missions become.
7636 : And you have to boldly rush into places where angels fear to tread. It really is tough!
7637 : Whoa!  You're alive? Are you sure you're not a ghosty-whosty?
7638 : Giddeus really was a scary-wary place, right? Anyway, I'm glad you made it back safely.
7639 : Ah! Doesn't this mean you go up in rank? ...Wow, congratulations!
7640 : TeN sAiDyOu WOulDgEt arEwARd...
7641 : kEEpUp tHeGooD wORktO MaKetHe NeXtrANk!
7642 : Hmm... A-ha!  You would be suitable for this mission...
7643 : I heard word that the Optistery's Library of Magic is after a highly capable adventurer. I don't know what it entails, but they say it's urgent.
7644 : How about it then? Do you accept this mission?
7645 : Accept Mission? Accept. Decline.
7646 : Very well... Go meet the Minister of the Optistery.
7647 : The Library of Magic is straight up the road there. The road runs between the two wings of the Optistery building.
7648 : If you head straight back up the road there, you'll pass through the archway of a two-story building that opens out into the Huntsman's Court.
7649 : That's the Optistery. The Library of Magic is housed there. The Optistery stores a vast collection of books and scrolls that it lends out to the general public.
7650 : It's very unusual for the Optistery to ask for assistance from the gatehouses.
7651 : For ordinary overdue library books, the Optistery just asks any passer-by to help them out. I wonder if something serious has happened!?
7652 : I don't read at all, so I have no interest in the library.
7653 : Reading books just isn't in vogue these days. It has to have the impact and excitement of a wandering minstrel's song or a street performance to grab the attention of people today.
7654 : tHeRoLe oFBOOKs IstO rEcORdtHe TRuTHstHaT gEtlOsT iNTiMe, ISit nOt?
7655 : BUt TeNhEaRD tHErEaRe soMebOOks ThaTREcorD UN-TruthS!WhYwOuLd pEoPledo tHat?
7656 : Hrm. Hrmmm... Hrrrmmmmmm...hrm!
7657 : ...Hrm!? Sorry about that. I was just thinking...
7658 : I'm facing my first crisis since taking over as Minister of the Optistery here...
7659 : .........Hrm? By the way, who in my stars are you? Wha-wha-what? You're the adventurer sent here to help from the gatehouse?
7660 : ......Hrmmmm? Oh, so you're the adventurer sent here to help from the gatehouse, huh?
7661 : Well then, let me explain. Hrmmm...... Where do I start?
7662 : Firstly, do you know the role of the Optistery's Library of Magic?
7663 : This is a repository for the storage and preservation of innumerable scrolls and books, from ages long past right up to the present.
7664 : The most important role of our librarians is to consign our entrusted writings to posterity, without ever losing a single one of them.
7665 : Why, even during that terrible war twenty years ago, we were able to protect almost all of the books.
7666 : But the restricted books section is another matter.
7667 : Restricted books are never allowed to be taken out of the Library of Magic, and are normally sealed away in a special room.
7668 : Manuscripts, life-threateningly dangerous to those weak in magical power...
7669 : Books of the dark arts, not to be viewed by mortal eyes... Ancient scrolls not even the Minister of the Optistery is allowed to open...
7670 : All of which are writings that, if taken outside, would cause great calamity. However, one very important book disappeared during the war twenty years ago, and has never been seen since.
7671 : But recently, I received word that said book had fallen into the dirty paws of that outrageous Mithran Cat Burglar who inhabits Windurst Woods.
7672 : Although the source of this information is dubious, the possibility that she has that book is a matter of great consequence.
7673 : That's where you come in... I want you to go meet that so-called Cat Burglar and confirm whether or not she possesses any of our restricted books.
7674 : The Optistery must retrieve any restricted books back as soon as possible, and at any cost. We are counting on you!
7675 : Hrmmm...... I wonder if that so-called Mithran Cat Burglar really has one of our restricted books.
7676 : If it is true, it's a gravely dangerous situation. Anyone with weak magical powers would be killed the second they opened such a book!
7677 : One of the restricted books lost during the war has come to light?
7678 : Tosuka-Porika has been searching so hard for those lost restricted books ever since he became minister.
7679 : We can all sleep easier if we find even one lost book.
7680 : I wonder what in Vana'diel is contained in the missing restricted book?
7681 : But, I guess with our level of magic, we couldn't open it, let alone read what's inside... Then again, I'd like to peek at what's on the cover, at least.
7682 : Some ancient manuscripts are enchanted with extremely powerful magic, and don't need to have the contents transcribed letter by letter like this.
7683 : They are the restricted books...special writings that only the Minister of the Optistery is allowed to handle.
7684 : ...Huah? What's that you say...? Oh, yeah, the restricted book that was lost twenty years back...?
7685 : Yeah, it sounds like a lot of trouble. So much of a hurry-scurry, I can hardly sleep...
7686 : What's going on? The minister seems to be troubled... But the dimwit at the counter is half-asleep as usual.
7687 : I'm quite knowledgeable about the war of twenty years ago, as it's in our history textbooks. When the town became a battlefield, the librarians carried the books through the flames to Heavens Tower.
7688 : Many of the librarians lost their lives as they ran there and back again, over and over through the flames.  Or so the history books say... Quite a tragic tale when you think about it.
7689 : Hrmm!? Oh, you're finally back!
7690 : How did it go? Did that so-called Mithran Cat Burglar really have her paws on one of our restricted books?
7691 : ...Wha-wha-wha-what!? Preposterous! The Book of the Gods...!? No...! The time for the Book of the Gods to lose its magic has come...!? Wha...!?
7692 : It's said that when the Book of the Gods loses its magic power and returns to blank pages, the shadows of destruction will set upon our world...
7693 : Hrm! Really, how could such a fearful thing ever happen!?
7694 : Ajido-Marujido! I bet you wanted the Book of the Gods so badly that you came up with this preposterous lie. Hrmmm...
7695 : Don't you worry about Ajido-Marujido! I'll report him to the Star Sibyl myself.
7696 : And as for you, adventurer. I must warn you to forget this ever happened! You understand?
7697 : Hrmmmm! You must not frighten the others with rumors that the Book of the Gods has gone blank. Forget everything that happened. You understand?
7698 : There are many restricted books, but the Book of the Gods is in a class of its own.
7699 : It's called a history book, but it doesn't just contain history. Sorry. It's not my specialty, so I don't know the details.
7700 : So, all that talk about finding one of our lost restricted books turned out to be empty rumors.
7701 : The minister won't be able to sleep any easier after all. Poor thing...
7702 : The Book of the Gods is said to contain fearful knowledge that is written in incredibly difficult incantations.
7703 : The previous minister of our Optistery, the great genius Karaha-Baruha, might have been able to decipher it...
7704 : ...Huah? What's that you say...? Book of the Gods?
7705 : I prefer a nooks of the nods myself... Leave me alone...  ZZZzzz...
7706 : What's going on? The minister seems to be troubled... But the dimwit at the counter is half-asleep as usual.
7707 : Hey, I wonder if they have any books written by one of the line of great geniuses?
7708 : I should ask the minister about it one day.
7709 : An interesting mission has just come in from the Aurastery's School of Magic.
7710 : What do you think? Do you accept this mission?
7711 : Accept Mission? Accept. Decline.
7712 : This is the first time you've accepted a mission for the Aurastery, right? The School of Magic run by the Aurastery is here in the eastern side of Windurst Waters.
7713 : The principal of the school is away as usual, so ask the teachers as to what your task is.
7714 : You've been to the Aurastery before, right? The School of Magic run by the Aurastery is here on the east side of Windurst Waters.
7715 : The School of Magic run by the Aurastery is here on the east side of Windurst Waters.
7716 : To find out what the mission is about, ask the teachers in the staff room there.
7717 : The School of Magic!? That place is a number-crunching hell! One step inside there and you're instantly differentiated and evaluated.
7718 : Shivers! That place is, like, 2.352 times scarier than Giddeus!
7719 : That School of Magic is full of cheeky little genius brats. They are constantly poking their noses into adult business, so it should be interesting to see what kind of adults they become themselves.
7720 : You got it! I abhor children. I don't even want to believe I was once one myself.
7721 : cHiLdrEn'sBoDieS mAyBe ImMAtuREbUt ThEiRhEaRtS ArESTroNg!
7722 : AdUlTs'bOdIeS aReSTroNG buttHeIr hEaRTsArE WEak!
7723 : TEN'sbOdY aNdHeArT areBOth weAK! ITis ShAmEfUl!
7724 : You actually accepted the Aurastery's skills exam assignment again? The best of luck this time too, then.
7725 : You remember the errand, I recall, but let me rapidly reiterate to be real sure...
7726 : We're setting up a skills test for our school's students to see how many monsters they can slay.
7727 : Are you the adventurer who accepted the Aurastery's ardent assignment? Excellent! We were excitedly expecting you.
7728 : The School of Magic is setting up a skills test to see how many monsters the students of the advanced class can slay.
7729 : We applied for an able adventurer to assist us in arranging our skills exam, all right?
7730 : You're expecting an elementary exam, except at the School of Magic it is an enormous event that affects the educatees' enlightened existence and so we extoll excruciating exactness.
7731 : First, fine friend, find out how ferociously fierce the foes are in the field where the skills test is being formulated.
7732 : Carry this charmed doll to Tahrongi Canyon, can you? My magic mannequin will memorize how many monsters you maim there.
7733 : The doll's enchantment expires at the end of one day. Once the wizardly works wear off it's worthless... So kindly come back quick.
7734 : I'll immediately magick my miniature marionette. I presume you are punctually prepared?
7735 : Ready already? Roger, Roger! Naysay, nay!
7736 : Incantation incorporated. Godspeed and Goddess bless!
7737 : ...Return when you're arranged, not deranged.
7738 : See how many monsters you may maim in Tahrongi Canyon, can you? The counting charm cast on the magic doll disappears in a day. Better be back by then!
7739 : The skills test will be performed in threes, pertaining it's particularly preferable to appropriate a party with experienced explorers.
7740 : Wow...I avow it's now #! So, lo, # [hour/hours] to go. Sublime! You've plenty of time till the chime.
7741 : Gee, I see it after # be. Fussed! There's just # [hour/hours] to bust. Get along there! Not much longer to the gong, hear?
7742 : Blast... It's at last past #. I'm bereft there's only # [hour/hours] left. Your time's as good as up I see, so return the magic doll to me.
7743 : There, there, don't be such a square. Loosen up a little, gee... Be more footloose and fancy free.
7744 : Do not worry that your grading shall smite the student's fate forever, pal. When he grows up, pray, he's not going to say, That teacher made me who I am today.
7745 : The Aurastery's School of Magic was creatively created to expansively expand the able abilities of child geniuses with the motto Wisely, Strongly, Correctly.
7746 : Our skills guidance and testing promotively promote the strongly part of that motto. We truly appreciate your cooperative cooperation.
7747 : Do your best to help us make this year's skills test as fair and square as we can. Improvisation is encouraged. The students can work in parties, and so can you.
7748 : Be careful of the time limit, though. If I were you, I'd give myself about an hour to rush back to Mr. Moreno-Toeno.
7749 : ...... It doesn't matter whether we hold exams or not. I don't care how people assess me.
7750 : Last year's skills test was held in Tahrongi Canyon. I wonder if this year's test will be held there, or on the Buburimu Peninsula...?
7751 : During the skills test, two Cardians are assigned to each student. How you make your party members fight is an important factor in the exam.
7752 : I can't wait. I'm good at skills tests. Fighting's what I do best!
7753 : I heard you're gonna do the prep work for our skills test.
7754 : Well, don't expect us to suck up to you. There are other candidates for test supervisor too, ya know.
7755 : The whole class is abuzz about our skills test. But how come they all know so much?
7756 : Am I the only one out of the loop?
7757 : Heh-heh-heh. Our day of total black magic destruction has come, dude.
7758 : Just you watch! It'll be like, BLAM! Those enemies will be blown sky-high! I'll get the five-star award if it's the last thing I do.
7759 : H-h-h-h-huh... G-g-go o-outside and f-fight m-m-monsters...? J-j-just the th-thought of it m-makes m-me, sh-sh-shake.
7760 : I'm having twouble-wouble with my study-wudies, so I came from the beginners class to ask the teacher-weachers here for helpy-welpy.
7761 : But they all say the testy-westys are at handy-wandy, and are too busy-wusy to talky-walky. Won't someone just answer-wanser my simple-wimple question?
7762 : Reckoning your recorded results...
7763 : Mysterious! My magic doll must be mucking up...? Current calculations confirm you only defeated # monsters in the duration of a day.
7764 : How horribly hopeless! We should really redo it... Agree to another attempt at it?
7765 : Current calculations conclude you conquered # creatures in the continuance of a day.
7766 : Oh so so-so! <Sigh>...Why, if you were my spry student, you'd only obtain the order of 55 points, pushing it to pass!
7767 : Ah...agree to another attempt at it? Spend some more quality time at Tahrongi Canyon, can you? Go on, give it another go!
7768 : Current calculations conclude you conquered # creatures in the continuance of a day.
7769 : That implies a passing grade of precisely 85 points, I presume.
7770 : Well then, the next treacherous terrain to try will be the Buburimu Peninsula, I bet. But still, that will have to wait till we've time to kill. Then that's all, thanks.
7771 : Current calculations conclude you conquered # creatures in the continuance of a day.
7772 : That's high higher than I had hoped. Well, it wasn't worth worrying with the talk that the monsters have grown potently more powerful lately.
7773 : The next treacherous terrain to try will be the Buburimu Peninsula, I proceed to presume. But still, that will wait till we've time to kill. Then that's all forthwith, thank thee.
7774 : Oh, you overtly overdid it, I say! The wizardly works have wasted away on our magic doll today.
7775 : So sad, but too bad... S'pose you'll simply have to start over from scratch...
7776 : Attempt it again after you've, say, significantly strengthened your skills some, eh? Sorry, but against all ambition, I'm failing you on my magician's mission.
7777 : This time, try to maim as many monsters as you may in the insular Buburimu Peninsula today.
7778 : The charming charm cast on the magic doll disappears in two days. So come back quick before the wizardly works wear off once more.
7779 : Wow...I avow it's now #! So, lo, # [hour/hours] to go. Sublime! You've plenty of time till the chime.
7780 : Gee, I see it after # be. Fussed! There's just # [hour/hours] to bust. Get along there! Not much longer till the gong, hear?
7781 : Blast... It's at last past #. I'm bereft there's less than # [hour/hours] left. Your time's as good as up I see, so return the magic doll to me.
7782 : Merci... But, hmm, my, how mighty mysterious!? My magic doll must've gone amuck...?
7783 : My meticulous math maintains you maimed a mere # monsters in two miserable days. Ah, how abominably atrocious!
7784 : Attempt it again after you've, say, strengthened your skills some, okay? Sorry, but against all ambition, I'm failing you on the commissioned mission...
7785 : My diligent determinations declare you defeated # despicable deed-doers during the duration of dual days!
7786 : Rah-rah! Rather well run there! We'll refer to your results record, sure I am, when we replan our next skills exam!
7787 : We'll give you word when we hold the test, which you're always welcome to watch!
7788 : My meticulous math maintains you massacred # monsters in a matter of days. Ah, you actually are an amazingly able adventurer!
7789 : Thank goodness-woodness you passed by. A very serious mission has been issued from Heavens Tower.
7790 : This is a large-scale mission suitable only for an experienced adventurer such as you.
7791 : The details will be explained at Heavens Tower, so hurry-wurry over to Windurst Walls.
7792 : I heard about the mission. It sure sounds serious.
7793 : Ah! Boy, am I gladdy-waddy I'm just a simple guard. I'm not cut out for such responsible missions.
7794 : Heavens Tower is actually a giant star tree blessed with the protection of the skies and stars. It truly-wuly is the center of Windurst.
7795 : ThE hEaD sEctIoNSof uscARdiAns aReCuLtIvAtEd iNtHe BAseMEnTOf HEaVeNs tOwEr!
7796 : SeE! lOOkCarEfuLLy aNdYoU wIllnOtE TEn'SHeAd isfrUIt oftREe!a-MaZinG, hUh!?
7797 : This current mission can probably only be accomplished by a person accustomed to adventure. Do your besty-westy for Windurst!
7798 : Hurry-wurry to Windurst Walls. The secretary of Heavens Tower will explain what you need to know.
7799 : It gives food for thought... You too have finally become an able enough adventurer to be hailed by Heavens Tower.
7800 : Huh? But the one who summoned you was Heavens Tower's guardian of law and justice, Semih Lafihna!?
7801 : Uh-oh? What trouble did you get into? Don't tell me you're being sent to that scary-wary prison!
7802 : Once that Sibyl Guard fixes her eyes on you, trying to deceive her is a waste of timey-wimey.
7803 : Semih Lafihna is an especially close friend of the Star Sibyl. You better get a move on to Heavens Tower, or you'll be thrown in the Horutoto Ruins' jaily-waily!
7804 : The Sibyl Guards who attend on the Star Sibyl are all Mithra.
7805 : But they are different from the other Mithra you see around town. They have made a heartfelt pledge of allegiance.
7806 : After the war, several Mithra cubs were sent to serve at Heavens Tower.
7807 : By rights they should have been mere ladies-in-waiting, but by the Star Sibyl's grace, they were allowed to serve as special protectors of Heavens Tower. That's how the Sibyl Guards were born.
7808 : OnLyA pRiVilEgEdfEw ArEaLLowEd toGo uPTO tHeSeCoNd aNdtHiRd flOOrsoF HEaVeNs TOwEr...!

7810 : Last time, Semih Lafihna called you to Heavens Tower. This time, it is the head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba, who has issued us with a writ of summons to give to you.
7811 : I can't even imagine what kind of mission-wission awaits you.
7812 : I just pray that they don't push some kind of completely unreasonable demand onto you. Anyway, you'd better hurry-wurry over to Heavens Tower again.
7813 : Zubaba, the Star Sibyl's head lady-in-waiting, has issued another writ of summons for us to pass on to you.
7814 : Sounds like she means business-wusiness. You'd better get a move on to Heavens Tower-wower!
7815 : If I had to pick one word to describe Zubaba, head lady-in-waiting, it would be...
7816 : ...naggy-waggy-craggy-daggy- shaggy-scraggy-baggy-haggy!!!
7817 : ...So, ahem, I strongly suggest you rush to Heavens Tower.
7818 : The Star Sibyl's vestal ladies-in-waiting are the admiration and dream of every Tarutaru girl.
7819 : Ahhh...I wish I was born a girl so I could serve at the side of the great Sibyl. Not that serving by the side of Mokyokyo is bad or anything...
7820 : According to the budding young ladies-in-waiting, the worst part about Heavens Tower is the mumbling-grumbling nagging of their head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba.
7821 : I wonder why the older you get, the louder you grow. I guess you can't chew on things as well as you used to, so you bite at people instead.
7822 : oNe NeEdSSPeCiaL quALItieStO bEcOmeA lAdY-In-WaITing!

7824 : Attention!!!
7825 : We have a formal writ of summons from Heavens Tower for you. It is officially and formally a mission of the utmost importance.
7826 : A high and noble person awaits you there. Drop everything and hurry on over to Heavens Tower.
7827 : Of all the official documents issued by Heavens Tower, the ones with a special star emblem on them are top-class super-important papers! And this one is in the handwriting of the Star Sibyl herself!
7828 : Gee... I wish I could get invitations to Heavens Tower from the Star Sibyl like this one.
7829 : Wow! A writ of summons with a star emblem on it! You are incredible! Incredibly incredible!
7830 : I knew there was something different about my friend, %. I bet you have a lucky star shining down on you. You should treasure it greatly!
7831 : You shouldn't be dawdling here. Hurry on over-wover to Heavens Tower!
7832 : You're nowhere near high enough in position to keep the Star Sibyl waiting. Not in a million light-years...! You better head to Heavens Tower immediately!
7833 : ThE NOrThgaTeHouSe wAsIn AbIg fUsSwHEn alEtter aRRiVedfRoM HEaVenS ToWer.
7834 : NoWTeN sEEstHe fUsSwAs ReAlLyoVeR yOu!
7835 : Keep your composure now, %. An emergency order has been issued to the guards and a select few adventurers loyal to Windurst.
7836 : The issuance of missions has been stopped pending-wending instructions from Heavens Tower. Please stand by till then.
7837 : What in Windurst is going on? For Heavens Tower to stop us from issuing missions...? Almost looks like we're about to go to war, or something!
7838 : Ah!? No, we couldn't possibly be...! Windurst is in a peace accord, right?
7839 : Hmm... Heavens Tower is in turmoil over something big.
7840 : My little sister is a lady-in-waiting, so I want to ask her about a lot of this stuff. But that would just be putting her on the spot.
7841 : wecaNNot iSSuemiSSionS fOrNoW!

7843 : This is an urgent-wurgent mission from Heavens Tower!
7844 : According to the mission instructions, you are to head to the cursed Northlands...or, more precisely, to the ruins of Fei'Yin, northeast of the Beaucedine Glacier.
7845 : You are to receive further details and a seal at Heavens Tower, so please head there right away.
7846 : According to the mission instructions, you are to head to the cursed Northlands...or, more precisely, to the ruins of Fei'Yin, northeast of the Beaucedine Glacier.
7847 : You are to receive further details and a seal at Heavens Tower. If you don't have the seal yet, you should go get it from the Great Star Tree before you proceed.
7848 : I heard from Mokyokyo that the talisman that sealed the Shadow Lord has been stolen!
7849 : The talisman itself was supposed to be sealed away in the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins with a magical barrier protecting it, right!? The one who stole it must be an extremely powerful magician!
7850 : Our fellow guards are currently checking whether the talismans sealed away in the other countries are safe or not.
7851 : You have already received the order to head out for the ruins of Fei'Yin. Carry out your appointed task well, my friend! We're counting on you!

7855 : Do your best to see your assigned task through. We are rooting-wooting for you!
7856 : %, another star emblem letter from Heavens Tower has arrived for you. You know the drill, right? Please head to Heavens Tower again.
7857 : Do your best to see your assigned task through. We are rooting-wooting for you!
7858 : Seems as though the conference of ministers has ended. I wonder what was on the agenda-wenda of that meeting?
7859 : Hey, now your position is high enough to come and go from Heavens Tower as you please, right? I promise not to tell anyone, so please let me know what's going on!
7860 : As soon as I heard the sudden convocation of the five ministries, I had a bad feeling about it.
7861 : After the last incident in the Horutoto Ruins, I knew there was something scary-wary going down.
7862 : TEN'sbrAIn TrIeDtO aNaLyZetHe cURreNtsITuaTIon!

7865 : Hey, you're high enough in position to freely come and go from Heavens Tower, right? I promise I won't tell anyone, so please let me know what's going on!
7866 : A little while ago, a letter with a shooting star emblem on it was delivered to each of the ministers of the five ministries.
7867 : A shooting star emblem signifies as fast as possible, so I delivered them as quickly-wickly as I could.

7873 : Hu-hmm See... Try a little taste. C'est parfait, n'est-ce pas?
7874 : Cooking is as much an art as music and painting are. Can your taste buds appreciate the full value of our works of art?
7875 : If you are confident enough, why not try your hand at cooking? You've come to the right place... That's what we're here for.
7876 : The Tarutaru in charge of the stew pot, Ranpi-Monpi, loves to experiment with his cooking.
7877 : But the results of his experiments are, well...perhaps a little too, erh...progressive...?
7878 : Kind of like the...rather unique way he speaks.
7879 : The qualities needed to be a good cook are strong arms, a sense of taste, and devotion.
7880 : It might not look as exciting or empowering when compared to other craft skills, but don't let that fool you. There's nary a more useful skill for long-distance travel.
7881 : If you want to enjoy each day, each meal has to be enjoyable too.
7882 : No matter how good it is for the body, unsavory food just isn't good for the soul.
7883 : The qualities needed to be a good cook may be strong arms, a sense of taste, and devotion. But without the finest ingredients, you won't go far...
7884 : Cooking is as much an art as music and painting. Can your taste buds appreciate the full value of our works of art?
7885 : If you want to taste our cooking, go try zee restaurant across zee way.
7886 : Zee food we make 'ere ees served at zee restaurant zere.
7887 : If you're out to enjoy the flavors, dainty little delicacies are all fine and well. But sometimes you've got to have your fill of food without much taste too.
7888 : Especially for a growing young'un such as yourself, it's a matter of volume, not taste, right? Well, I say, good for you! Eat up and grow strong!
7889 : Sacrebleu! What should I do?
7890 : Hey, you zere! Can you keep a secret?
7891 : Sacrebleu! Not again!?
7892 : Oh, you're back...and just in time!  Au secour! Pleeze save Windurst one more time!
7893 : I went and made zee same mistake as I deed last time!
7894 : Az I explained before, non? Windurst eez trying to maintain its hard-earned peace with zose Yagudo beastmen.
7895 : One of our efforts eez a promise to give zee Yagudo a regular peace offering of food.
7896 : But I went and mixed % into zee food offering by mistake.
7897 : If you race over to Giddeus, you should make it in time. Pleeze! You've got to help before one of zee Yagudo tastes my disaster and gets insulted by it!
7898 : Are you tight-lipped? Yes. Mum's the word! No, I can't keep my mouth shut.
7899 : Oh, then forget what I just said. You didn't hear anything!
7900 : Don't laugh or tease me, but, well...
7901 : Zee truth eez, I've made a terrible, terrible mistake!
7902 : You see, Windurst eez trying to improve its relations with zee Yagudo beastmen.
7903 : One of our peace efforts is a promise to provide zee Yagudo with food offerings, prepared and sent by zee Rhinostery and zis Culinarians' Guild.
7904 : But I think I went and mixed a horrible % into zee food offering by mistake.
7905 : Au secours! You've got to help me! Pleeze race to Giddeus as fast as you can and retrieve zee food bags with % mixed een zem.
7906 : Listen to his request? Oui. Non.
7907 : Ooh... Merci-werci!
7908 : Zee food bags with % mixed in zem were probably delivered by zee adventurers who received zee mission from zee gatehouse.
7909 : But if you race on over to Giddeus right away, you should make it in time. Pleeze, you've got to get zere before zee Yagudo try zem!
7910 : Zee food bags with % mixed in zem were probably delivered by zee adventurers who received zee mission from zee gatehouse.
7911 : But if you race on over to Giddeus right away, you should make it in time. Pleeze, you've got to get zere before zee Yagudo try zem!
7912 : The food offerings sent to Giddeus consist of Yagudo cherries from the Rhinostery and apple juice from the Culinarians' Guild.
7913 : But who would be so stupid as to mistake apple juice and %...?
7914 : The food offerings made to the Yagudo are first placed in the two altars in front of each of the cavern entrances in Giddeus.
7915 : But if you don't hurry up, the Yagudo will carry them off to their underground treasure chambers for later distribution.
7916 : It's like that cooking experiment Ranpi-Monpi tried a little while ago. Just as bad a mistake, that was!
7917 : He tried using % instead of apple juice, but the results was so sour, no one could stomach it.
7918 : Anybody--not just the Yagudo--would be livid if they were served a mess like that.
7919 : Ranpi-Monpi is really a great chef when he sticks to ordinary cooking...
7920 : It's his unparalleled curiosity and harebrained personality that often gets him into trouble like this.
7921 : Oh thank you so very much! You saved my life!
7922 : At zee moment, zis eez all I have to give you... Apart from my sincere gratitude, of course!
7923 : Merci! Thank you very much. We're all so obliged.
7924 : Zee peace of Windurst has been saved, thanks to you!
7925 : On the other side of this gate, the wild grasslands of West Sarutabaruta await.
7926 : Beginners might best start out fighting simple bumblebees. But be careful, for even in the same species of bee, there are strong ones and weak ones. Generally, the further you go away from town the stronger they get.
7927 : Whoa! Hold on there! Are you properly equipped to head outside?
7928 : Just holding armor and weapons in your inventory is useless. You first have to equip these items to wear them properly. You understand?
7929 : Whoa! Hold on there! Are you properly equipped to head outside?
7930 : Just holding armor and weapons in your inventory is useless. You first have to equip these items to wear them properly. You understand?
7931 : You are currently in the Windurst Waters district. There are three other districts in Windurst. Windurst Walls is to the east, Port Windurst is to the south, and Windurst Woods is to the southeast.
7932 : You can keep your bearings by using the giant star tree you can see far in the eastern sky as a marker.

7944 : MaChItAtA iSIn cHaRgeOf eXpLaInIngtHeSe!
7945 : Hiya! Are you lost or something? If you're in trouble, Anja-Enja's here to helpy-welpy!
7946 : Well, if you ever need help, feel free to ask one of us guards.
7947 : Helping out people in need is the calling of us guards in Windurst Waters's North Winds troupey-woupey.
7948 : Ask for help on...? Nothing right now. Where are we? How to leave town. Where's the residential area?
7949 : This is the Windurst Waters district. Just north of here are the Optistery, the Aurastery, and a general goods store. South of here are the Rhinostery and the hatter's.
7950 : What? You want to know more or something?
7951 : Ask for further info on...? Don't bother. What's north of here? What's south of here?
7952 : The quickest way to leave town from here is Odin's Gate, which takes you out to West Sarutabaruta. Head north and pass through the archway of the Optistery's Library of Magic.
7953 : Then go over the bridge until you get to the northern gatehouse. (That's where we guards of Windurst Waters meet, you know?) Head through the gate and you'll find yourself outside in West Sarutabaruta.
7954 : Windurst's residential area is northeast of here. To get there, first head north and cross the bridge to the east that leads to the Aurastery and Windurst Walls.
7955 : On the way, you'll come across a Cardian automaton guard. Turn right when you see him and you'll easily find your way there.
7956 : You know about the residential area's Mog Houses, rightaru? If not, just ask the guards at the entrance to the residential area for information.
7957 : AlLoW JaCk tO eXpLaIn mOrE aBoUt WiNdUrSt...
7958 : Don't know Jack about...? Battling. Shopping. Gathering info. Where you are.
7959 : Well, of course I can't see anything during the day. I know-wow that! I'm just saving this space so nobody takes it during the day. Yawn...
7960 : Nuah-ha-ha-ha... This is astronomical! It always amazes me how clearly-wearly we can see something so far away!
7961 : Every star has its own name, just like we do! Doesn't that just make you have a closer affinity with them?
7962 : Windurst is protected by the stars. Here at the Optistery, we record the position of the stars every night for posterity's sake.
7963 : They say the Planetarium in Heavens Tower can display all the star formations of every age. I would love to have a look at it, but it'd probably be beyond my understanding.
7964 : Things are a total blur lately... I'm having trouble focusing...
7965 : For instance, take the constellation of Ifrit that shines in the northwest sky. I can see the bright red star and kind of make out the next brightest star, but that's about it.
7966 : This telescope is really old, so perhaps it's the telescope and not me! It must be time to change its stellar mirror.
7967 : But it's said the material needed to make stellar mirrors is only dropped by powerful monsters found in the Northlands. Now I'm in a fix...
7968 : This telescope is really old, and it's about time to change its stellar mirror.
7969 : But it's said the material needed to make stellar mirrors is only dropped by powerful monsters found in the Northlands. Now I'm in a fix! I'll have to reflect on the matter...
7970 : The three telescopes found here are hundreds of years old and have become rather antiquated.
7971 : Many a time there's been talk of rebuilding them, but we've not been able to do it yet.
7972 : Just getting you hands on a crystal lens is hard enough, not to mention the other thingy-wingys you need.
7973 : I bet our ancestors who made these telescopes didn't think they'd be in use hundreds of years later. Nor that their old worthless currency would be so valuable to us now.
7974 : Ah! What's this? It can't really be %, can it!?
7975 : My stars! I was needing this to help me make a new stellar mirror for this telescope.
7976 : My dear adventurer, would you be willing to help me remake this telescope's stellar mirror?
7977 : To observe the stars properly, we first need to accurately inscribe the fundamental star positions onto this %.
7978 : In order to do that, we need %. These are the ancient shell coins made in the era of the first Star Sibyl.
7979 : There's hardly any of the old currency to be found these days, so it'll be a quite a job to find one of the precious coins.
7980 : It would help me so much to have one of those old coins. I'd be willing to pay you back greatly, so please do your best to find me one.
7981 : If only I had %, I'd be able to inscribe the correct star positions onto the %. Otherwise, I won't be able to make heads or tails of it.
7982 : I'm willing to pay you quite well, so please do your best to find me one.
7983 : In olden days, pirates used the ancient Tarutaru money, which had the constellations drawn on them, to help them navigate by the stars...or so the folktales go.
7984 : But now that most of the open seas have been charted into set shipping routes, they don't need % anymore.
7985 : Hanging on to old money-woney is useless, as it soon loses its value.
7986 : But then again, if it was sought after by our ancestors, I'm sure someone would find some kind of value in it these days. I wonder if anybody has some stashed away?
7987 : Wow! I never thought you'd actually find one of these! What, did you travel back in time to ancient Windurst or something?
7988 : Thank you so dearly! Now I can make a new stellar mirror for this telescope.
7989 : I'm so in debt to you. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation...
7990 : Oh then, Odin's to the north. Right and, Titan's to the south. Shivers, Shiva's to the east. And then, Leviathan's to the west.
7991 : The mysterious legendary gods drawn on this coin are said to be the avatars that the first Star Sibyl had encountered.
7992 : How did you manage to get your hands on %? I never thought we'd see one of those again!
7993 : Oh, I see... Wa-ha-ha! Those old buccaneers had some hidden away, eh? Even pirates come in useful at times too, huh?
7994 : When you gaze at the night skies, you note stars of all different colors, right? Placed together, those stars form the constellations of the gods.
7995 : The aqua-colored stars in the east sky that form the constellation of Shiva are so alluring... We astronomers like those stars the best.
7996 : I never thought you'd actually find one of these! What, did you travel back in time to ancient Windurst or something?
7997 : Huh? Hold on a second... This is a fake...! It's funny money!
7998 : The positioning of the constellations isn't right on this coin. I guess you'll have to search harder to find a real one.
7999 : That reminds me...I once read in an ancient scroll that there were too many forgeries of the old shell coins, so we Tarutaru abandoned them for gil instead.
8000 : Please find me a coin with the correct positioning of the constellations on it.
8001 : The real classical Tarutaru money has Odin drawn to the north, of course.
8002 : You can'taru go having Odin on the east or west now, can you?
8003 : Alexander shines bright and white in the northeastern sky. Titan's in the south and Leviathan's in the west.
8004 : See him spread his imaginary wings there? Connect the stars together and you can make lots of shapes... Look! There's the great Onion in the sky!
8005 : Whaddaya want-want? Can'tya see I'm busy-busy preparing for my astronomic observations?
8006 : Hm. I infer somebody wants to see my stellar stellar map, perhaps?
8007 : See the stellar map? Stellar! Map-schmap!
8008 : Then don't bug-bug me again! People's lives are but a fleeting moment when compared to the lives of the stars. There are so many stars to map, I don't wanna waste a second second!
8009 : Humph-humph. Good to see someone has an interest in the stars.
8010 : Climbing the northern sky is the famous Odin. The black point there is Odin's beloved steer, Sleipnir.
8011 : And above that--although in the actual night sky it appears below Sleipnir--is the North Star, the prominently bright star that sailors guide their ships by.
8012 : If you want to further further your interest in the stars, then you're always welcome to visit here and see my stellar stellar map.
8013 : This is the Rhinostery. We run a biological laboratory that uses magic to study all kinds of living things here.
8014 : Some people mistakenly think we're just a botanical garden, but we study fauna as well as flora.
8015 : It's just that we can't keep a zooful of animals here in the middle of town, right? So the staff here who specialize in zoology have to study out of town. That's why our minister, Rukususu, is out journeying right now.
8016 : I...am...Kenapa-Keppa...
8017 : Yeah...that's...my...erh...name...
8018 : We...mainly...study...nature...here...
8019 : Y'know...plants...and...animals... ...and...that...kinda...thing...?
8020 : Zzz... Mmm...<mumble-mumble>...
8021 : Mmm... I'm so full... Zzz...
8022 : Have you heard about the great beast, you therey? They say it's sealed inside Horutoto Ruins... How scary!
8023 : All let out a collective sigh, when they stopped seeing it in the night sky. Since the war of twenty years ago, its fate, our scientists strive to know.
8024 : Zzz... Mmm...<mumble-grumble>...
8025 : No... I haven't filled in the empty space yet... Wait... Zzz...
8026 : The...glowing...plants... you...see...around...town...
8027 : ...They're... Fluoro-flora...
8028 : Uh, excuse my tummy-grumbles. I'm utterly famished.
8029 : But now is the critical point that will decide whether this project is a success or a total failure.
8030 : I can't take my eyes off my work, so I can't move right now. Why, I can't even afford to sleep!
8031 : Oooh... But I'm so hungry! I feel like I'm starving to death...
8032 : Aagh! Nothing's left from the food I prepared in advance.
8033 : Our...work...
8034 : ...never...works...
8035 : Cause...we...always...
8036 : ...take...our...eyes...off...it...
8037 : <burp>... Well, excuse me. As you can see, I'm not the slightest bit hungry...
8038 : This room's the Rhinostery's meditation chamber. Say, I wonder how the manic work's going in the higgledy-piggledy laboratory next door.
8039 : Huh? Their food supplies have run out so they say they're starving to death? Silly fools!
8040 : Well, I've only just woke up, so I'm not going out to buy them anything.
8041 : Why don't you go pick us up something, or even better, cook us up something? It should be an easy task for an adventurer such as you. Come on, show us what you're made of.
8042 : Do a food run? Well, okay... No way!
8043 : Too much of a bother, eh? Gee... For an adventurer, you sure don't like helping people out much.
8044 : How can you sleep at night, knowing the lab staff could drop dead of starvation at any moment? It's just a simple walk to the shops or a little bit of cooking. Why won't you help out?
8045 : Good, good! Thank you, finally. Very well, then...
8046 : I'll have %! They're so finger-lickingly scrumptious.
8047 : Be sure to ask the lab staff for their orders before you go. I'm sure they'll be most happy.
8048 : I'll have %, thanks! Be sure to ask the lab staff for their orders before you go.
8049 : Huh? Where's the money? What do you take me for? It's pay on delivery, of course!
8050 : You volunteered to go buy us some food? Why, that's most kind of you! What a godsend!
8051 : Well, as for me... I'll have % and %...
8052 : Oh, and I'll have a side order of % with that. Did you get all that?
8053 : I'll have the % with % and a side order of % to go, thank you.
8054 : While I'm waiting for you, I'll sink my last remaining energy into continuing this project.
8055 : My...order...?
8056 : ...? Oh...food...? ...Um...?
8057 : A... A... A...boiled...egg...! Yeah...that's...what...I'll...have...
8058 : ...Juice... ..without...additives...
8059 : Or...whatever...
8060 : Hey! These look good! I'm glad I managed to keep waiting!
8061 : Thanks... Take this for your troubles...
8062 : What's this?
8063 : Humph. I guess this is what they mean when they say Close is my shirt, but closer is my skin. This'll have to do, then. So I'll take it.
8064 : Of course, you're going to get Kenapa-Keppa and Kerutoto's orders as well, aren't you?
8065 : Just hand each of them their orders directly. I'm sure they don't want to wait any more than they have to.
8066 : Whoa! That's a surprise. How did you know what I wanted to eat?
8067 : Well, I'm not complaining, just surprised. But seeing as you're giving it to me without my asking, I assume I don't have to pay, right?
8068 : A-ha-ha... Just kidding. Relax. I was really intending to pay.
8069 : Whoa! That's a surprise. What's this all of a sudden? Is it okay for me to have this?
8070 : But seeing as you're giving it to me without my asking, I assume I don't have to pay, right?
8071 : A-ha-ha... Just kidding. Relax. I was really intending to pay.
8072 : ......!
8073 : You...under...stood...me...?
8074 : Thanks...a...lot...!
8075 : ...<Grin>...
8076 : ......?
8077 : ...No...good...? But...I...can't...hold...out... ...much...longer...<sniff>...
8078 : ......?
8079 : How...did...you...know...? ...This...is...just...what... ...I...wanted...
8080 : ......?
8081 : Are...you...giving...this...away...? ...Oh...? ...Money...? ...Here...
8082 : That's it! Great! I just love these...
8083 : I bet it was hard to come by! Here... I'll add a big tip to the price of the food to show you my appreciation.
8084 : Did you get the others what they wanted as well?
8085 : Give it straight to them, so you won't keep them waiting. I'm sure they'll fix you up for it themselves.
8086 : Hey...! I didn't order this!
8087 : But I'm hungry, so I guess this'll do.
8088 : Sorry to make an innocent passerby such as yourself go to all that trouble for us...
8089 : Our Rhinostery is the most unusual of the five ministries, but we're a nice bunch once you get to know us. Do call by anytime, now.
8090 : Huh? We shouldn't be talking about ourselves in that way? Wa-hahahaha-ha!
8091 : ...... Oh-no...
8092 : ...Hey...erh... ...Can...you...help...me...?
8093 : ...Bag...delivered...to...Mhaura...
8094 : ...Please...bring...here... Quickly...
8095 : ...Must...hurry...
8096 : Li...sten...to...re...quest? Ac...cept... Re...fuse...
8097 : ...Um...
8098 : Must...carry...over...night...
8099 : Must...get...back... ...be...fore...dawn...
8100 : ... Please... Carry...bag...back... ...before...day...break...
8101 : Sometimes I spend all night trying to have a decent conversation with Kenapa-Keppa.
8102 : I guess unless you have a personality like his, you wouldn't be able to spend years studying plants that don't talk.
8103 : As far as the study of plants here goes, Kenapa-Keppa is the one who most knows.
8104 : Kenapa-Keppa has a great dream, I support him to the extreme!
8105 : ...Aah......
8106 : ...... Past...dawn...
8107 : ...<sniff>... ...I...can't...pay...you...now...
8108 : ...All...that...for...no...thing...
8109 : ...Phew...
8110 : ...Good... ...You...made...it...
8111 : ...... ...Your...reward...
8112 : ...?
8113 : ...Seeds...
8114 : ...of...fluoro-flora...
8115 : I was wondering what he was asking you to do. Now I see it was bringing him the cargo shipped in via Mhaura.
8116 : I hope you kept to the time limit. Those things are extremely hard to handle.
8117 : You've seen the flowers all over Windurst that serve as streetlights, right?
8118 : Those flowers are called fluoro-flora. We cast magic on their seeds to enhance their illumination.
8119 : But the % needed to carry out our enhancing work is running in short supply.
8120 : Could I dare ask you to obtain % for us? I must warn you, it involves going to some dangerous territory!
8121 : Go fetch some water? Yes. No.
8122 : Thank you. Please fill this canteen full of water from the springs at the back of Giddeus.
8123 : The depths of Giddeus are indeed dangerous, so I don't blame you for backing out.
8124 : Parts of Giddeus can get confusing, so I recommend you check a map as you go.
8125 : Ah, it would be unthinkable to try to go there alone. You should gather a few competent adventurer friends so you can travel together. But don't worry. Your remuneration will be most handsome.
8126 : What? You lost my canteen? Here, take another. But be more careful with people's things, okay?
8127 : Oh! Well done!
8128 : Right on time, too. I was down to my last drop.
8129 : Here's your remuneration. Please help us out again the next time our supply dwindles.
8130 : Currently, we can only obtain % from the springs at the back of Giddeus. However, the magic of that water has weakened considerably.
8131 : We used to be able to find stronger magic water in another place, but that was before the war...
8132 : What? It looks like I've been sleeping all day and haven't done any work?
8133 : How rude! Despite my appearance, I'm a brilliant and busy researcher who is feeling quite hard-pressed at the moment.
8134 : I specialize in the study of the heart and soul. You've heard the saying, Illness arises from the sickness of the spirit, right? Well, I'm researching the spirit part of that.
8135 : Whenever something strange happens, people call me. For instance, if you find a suspicious item, you should bring it to me to check.
8136 : What's this grubby little ribbon you brought me? Huh? You can hear strange voices?
8137 : Now that is peculiar! Please give it to me. I'll pay you # gil for it.
8138 : I enjoy collecting strange or mysterious things. It's part of my job to investigate them.
8139 : Hey, you! You should take responsibility for your evil actions!
8140 : This ribbon belongs to a deceased person whose body now rests in a grave somewhere. I don't care how poor you are! Grave-robbing is just plain criminal!
8141 : What do you mean, you didn't steal it? It was passed around until it came to you?
8142 : Well, now that it has fallen into your hands, you should return it to its rightful owner. I'm sure the poor old soul who lost this misses it greatly.
8143 : That % came from a grave somewhere. It belongs to a dead person.
8144 : You should return it to its rightful place. I'm sure the poor old soul who lost this misses it greatly.
8145 : You were able to purify that cursed ribbon? Well, that is good news. It was so noisy every night, I could hardly sleep.
8146 : Tonight, I'll be able to sleep well and have pleasant dreams. Well, time to get some well-earned sleep. Goodbye and sleep tight.
8147 : Zzz... Mmm...<mumble-mumble>...
8148 : Hiyaaa! Power punch!!!
8149 : Hey, is that the same ribbon as before? You mean it came back to you somehow?
8150 : Is it really one and the same? Please lend me this ribbon again for a little while.
8151 : Huh...? What did you do with that %? Don't tell me you threw it away somewhere!
8152 : Well, if it happens to come your way again, please bring it to me so I can check it. Cursed items are like boomerangs. They just keep on coming back!
8153 : There's a suspicious-looking book here...
8154 : Check its contents? No way! Take a peek.
8155 : Oh, no! You've been cursed!
8156 : ...or so you thought for a second there.
8157 : There's a thick book with a title you can't make out.
8158 : Have a quick look inside. No way! Take a peek.
8159 : Wow! You received 300,000 gil!
8160 : ...or so you thought for a second there.
8161 : You hear a strange sound... It appears to be coming from this book.
8162 : Check out what's inside? No way! Take a peek.
8163 : .........You simply can't open it!
8164 : Hrmm. Hey you! What are you doing there?
8165 : You look like an adventurer or some other riff-raff. It doesn't seem like you'd have any business with our distinguished Library of Magic!
8166 : Huah...? Say what...? This is the Library of Magic. If you make too much noise, we'll kick you out, so look around quietly!
8167 : Oh, and be warned. If layfolk such as you go around opening books at random, you could find yourself in more trouble than you bargained for. Huah...! ZZZzzz...
8168 : Shh...! Can't you see I'm in the middle of transcribing this book here? Please keep your voice down!
8169 : This is the manuscript room. This is where we carry out the transcription of the library's older books into new books.
8170 : This copying of manuscripts has been repeated for hundreds of years. It is a work that never finishes.
8171 : The books in this Library of Magic have special spells cast on them.
8172 : Those spells only last a few hundred years or so. That's why we recast them with new magic. If we don't, the knowledge found within these books will perish.
8173 : One of these ancient manuscripts has such extremely potent magic cast on it, it doesn't need to be transcribed over and over like this.
8174 : This manuscript is called the Book of the Gods. It is a special book that only the Minister of the Optistery is allowed to handle.
8175 : I'm going to read as many books as I can. With all that knowledge, I can become valedictorian of the School of Magic!
8176 : Then when I graduate, I'll enter one of the ministries, work my way up to minister, then become a professor when I retire.
8177 : Adults are always telling us not to say unchildish things. But we youths have to know the so-called workings of this world if we're going to survive.
8178 : If you go too slow, you'll be left behind in this ever-changing world of ours.
8179 : Hrrrrm... That can't be it... Then again... Hr-hr-hr-hrmm...
8180 : Hrm! Hey, you're the adventurer from the other day! I don't believe it! I don't believe a word anyone says!
8181 : Hr-hr-hr-hrmm... Thanks to some adventurer somewhere, I was able to awaken from an inescapable nightmare.
8182 : The resurrection of the Shadow Lord and the Book of the Gods losing its magic... Those things couldn't possibly happen. It was all but a dream...
8183 : Shh...!  Can't you see I'm in the middle of transcribing this book here? Please keep your voice down!
8184 : Heretofore, source of magick...primarily extrinsic energies...fill terra and caelum.
8185 : Tarutaru...analyzed...extrinsic energy...classifying into eight...elements. These...give birth magick...resides in soul...woven into spells...both...er, both...
8186 : ...What's this?
8187 : I don't know how to read this glyph. That's the trouble with ancient writings; the letters and characters are too hard to read...
8188 : Hey, you there! You wouldn't happen to be passing through West Sarutabaruta anytime soon, would you? If so, I have a little favor to ask...
8189 : Listen to Hariga-Origa's request? Listen. Don't listen.
8190 : Well, I guess it can't be helped then... I'll just have to give up until someone can go there for me.
8191 : One of our researchers just headed off to the Horutoto Ruins in West Sarutabaruta.
8192 : She specializes in paleography, so she should be able to read these glyphs with no trouble at all.
8193 : Could you do me a favor and pass her this memo? Her name is Ipupu.
8194 : Hurry up and pass that memo to Ipupu. She's in West Sarutabaruta, probably in one of the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins.
8195 : Until I can read the glyph I wrote in that memo, I have to give up... But I can't rest now, as I have so many other books to do. Guess I'll just have to get on with them in the meantime.
8196 : The transcription of these manuscripts is so bothersome. It's impossible to read the ancient letters, and if you make a little mistake in their pronunciation, BOOM! The whole book goes and explodes in your face.
8197 : But if you avoid the old books, you'll only have more trouble when it comes to reading the ancient writings. You just can't win.
8198 : Lately Ipupu has been transcribing some ancient scrolls regarding the Horutoto Ruins.
8199 : So my guess is that she's headed for the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins.
8200 : Oh, welcome back. Were you able to get any feedback from Ipupu?
8201 : Hu-hum... So, this glyph just has the meaning of sanative? Why didn't they just write healing, for crying out loud? Anyway, so where was I...
8202 : Heretofore, the source of magick was primarily the extrinsic energies that fill terra and caelum.
8203 : The Tarutaru had analyzed that extrinsic energy, classifying it into eight elements. These elements give birth to magick that resides in the soul to be woven into spells both sanative and hostile.
8204 : However, after many long years of study, the existence of a converse of extrinsic energy, intrinsic energy from the soul itself, was discovered.
8205 : Phew! This book is way too complicated. I think I'll leave it here for today...
8206 : Oh, that's right, I had better reward you with something for helping me out there. Let me see... How about this map I have here? I'm sure you'll find this useful in your adventures!
8207 : Let me see... What was that book about? Something to do with extrinsic energy and the soul's own intrinsic energy...?
8208 : That reminds me of something I heard in one of my lessons at the School of Magic... Magic from the heart that uses the soul's energy is what gave birth to magic dolls and automaton guards.
8209 : Hrmm. Hey you! What are you doing there?
8210 : Hrmm!? Just a second... I could use you. Would you be willing to do a little chore for me in return for some money?
8211 : Take on the chore? Accept. Decline.
8212 : You don't need the cash? Hah!  Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover, then... Anyway, I'm busy, so off with you!
8213 : Good!  First, let me explain a bit about our distinguished library.
8214 : Wha-wha-wha-what??? You don't need me to tell you? You already know?  Hr-hr-hr-hrmm...
8215 : This library's official name is the Federal Book Repository for Magical Knowledge and Research...
8216 : Also known as the Book Repository of General Knowledges. It is under the jurisdiction of the Optistery, the ministry that forbids the loss of knowledge.
8217 : Under the strict supervision of successive ministers, our Optistery has protected the knowledge stored here with a system that doesn't allow even a baby ant to go unaccounted for.
8218 : For instance, the diary that disappears into blank pages after three days, or the housekeeping account book that's so red, it makes your eyes weep.
8219 : Once a book or scroll is placed in our care, we will never allow its content to be lost.
8220 : Hrmm... However...several misfortunes have thrown the wheels of fate into disorder.
8221 : We want you to hunt down those books that have suffered such a sad fate, and bring them back to us.
8222 : Ask the librarian at the counter, Furakku-Norakku, for the details. We're counting on you, the savior of knowledge!
8223 : Hrm? Wha-wha-what's wrong? Are you fulfilling your role as the savior of knowledge?
8224 : Huh...? Savior of knowledge?
8225 : Oh...you mean the overdue book collector's job, right? Great. We need all the help we can get.
8226 : Let me see... This week, the following book is overdue...
8227 : Some Hume named Orn still has the book % out on loan.
8228 : First, ask around town to track the borrower down, hand him this card, get the book from him, and return it to me here.
8229 : Well, good luck. Phew... That's one less chore to do.
8230 : Huh? You forgot? You're supposed to be getting the overdue book, %, back from a Hume named Orn.
8231 : A Hume named Orn? Why would we know that? If it doesn't appear in our exams, then it's not worth learning!
8232 : You should ask adults such trivial questions. They have more time on their handy-wandies.
8233 : There's an adult who spends all day sitting in the tavern.
8234 : He's a reporter for the Magic Paradise Weekly. He boasts that nothing goes on in Windurst Waters without him knowing about it.
8235 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... What's that? You have a question you want to ask me, the walking library?
8236 : Oh, that's easy-weasy. Orn, the Hume gentleman you're referring to, is a traveler who's staying in the hostelry room right above us.
8237 : You disturbed my custard, cake, and jelly for such a trifling matter? Munch-munch...chew-chew...
8238 : Who are you?
8239 : Ah! Oh, no, %? Gosh, I've been meaning to tell them...
8240 : I don't know how to say this, but...I kinda lost the library book I borrowed...
8241 : I was on my way back to Mhaura when I was attacked by some Yagudo beastmen. In my desperation to escape, I started to throw my belongings at them...
8242 : ...Including that library book! I was intending to return to Mhaura and raise some money to take back to the library...
8243 : ...so I was wondering, could you ask the librarians to give me a little extension on the due date?
8244 : Some guy told me that the stuff the Yagudo steal is massed in the treasure chamber in the depths of Giddeus... But I can't exactly walk in there and get it now, can I?
8245 : Yagudo are smarter than your average monster, and tend to be downright vicious.
8246 : Huah...! What to do when you lose one of our books?
8247 : If that's the case, you've just lost an important national treasure! You can't just pay money to get out of it. You'll be sent to scary-wary prison! Just the thought gives me the shiver-wivers...
8248 : Anyway, you shouldn't be asking that. Hurry up and get % back off of him. I sure hope he hasn't lost it...!
8249 : That book you've got there!? Don't tell me you went all the way into the nest of the Yagudo in Giddeus!
8250 : What a courageous person you are! I can't believe you convinced the Yagudo to give the book back! I'm truly impressed!
8251 : Sorry to ask, seeing as you went out of your way and all, but...could you be so good as to return it to the Library of Magic for me?
8252 : I can't possibly show my face in there ever again!
8253 : Huaaah...? Oh, you got our overdue library book back?
8254 : Ah, but look at the poor thingy-wingy. It's been all ripped up and dirtied. I wonder what hideously hideous thing happened to it?
8255 : Here you go... This is for your troubles. Let's do this again sometime! The pleasure was mine, entirely...
8256 : Let's do the lost book retrieval again sometime, eh? Sorry, at the moment I'm all booked out! Huaaah... ZZZzzz...
8257 : Hrm. I hear another book crying somewhere... Hrrrmmmmmm...
8258 : If your journeys seem to have lost purpose of late, why not help out my ministry in your capacity as the savior of knowledge again?
8259 : Help out the library again? Listen to offer. Don't.
8260 : Let me see... Oh yeah... This week we have the following unreturned book...
8261 : Hae Jakkya from the Windurst Woods auction house.
8262 : She's still got the book % out on loan. Erch... That's one of those hot and steamy, mushy and slushy, love romance novels.
8263 : Huh? You forgot? It's Hae Jakkya, who runs the auction house in The Windurst Woods.
8264 : She's got a romance novel out called % that is now overdue. Please get it back for us, okay?
8265 : Ask Furakku-Norakku, librarian at the counter there, for the details. We're counting on you, the savior of knowledge!
8266 : Did you know...? They say that everyone in this world has at least one other person who looks exactly like them.
8267 : So that means there's another Kotan-Moritan who looks exactly like me out there somewhere! Man, that's pretty cool when you think about it.
8268 : Mithra names are so hard to pronounce with all those h's and stuff. I can't remember them at all.
8269 : But it's okay, because I have the perfect system. You just call them all Miss all the time. But no matter how old they are, never call them Missus, Lady, or Granny...they don't seem to like that.
8270 : Huh? What do you mean, she says she didn't borrow it? It says so right here...
8271 : But come to think of it, she doesn't seem the type to borrow such a tacky book. This is strange.
8272 : But look, it says Hae Jakhya right here on the borrower's card...
8273 : Huaaaah...? You found that overdue book?
8274 : Huh? Someone with almost the exact same name had it out on loan? Hm... Same diff...
8275 : Anyway, here's your payment, bucko. See you around next time, I s'pose...
8276 : I'll talk to you next time we have an unreturned book to fetch. Till then...  Huaaah... ZZZzzz...
8277 : Hae Jakkya from Windurst Woods' auction house? I remember now... She's a regular here. Never had a late book in her life.
8278 : If only all the Mithra were as diligent as she is. But don't get me started with my grumblings...
8279 : Shh...!  Can't you see I'm in the middle of transcribing this book? Please keep your voice down!
8280 : There are many books and scrolls preserved in Windurst, but the most important one, with the highest historical value, is the Book of the Gods.
8281 : The Book of the Gods is tightly guarded in innermost chambers of the Optistery. We don't know for sure what is contained in it or who wrote it.
8282 : As for this book, in the past it had been handed to the Yagudo by some wicked person. The scholar who retrieved the book back was able to reveal one of its secrets to us.
8283 : Just a second...?
8284 : My word! What are these brown smudges here? Thanks to these, I can't read the essential first page!
8285 : Hey, you again! You wouldn't be able to fetch me % and %, would you? If I have both of them, I'll be able to clean away these smudges, leaving these pages as good as new!
8286 : Accept request for help? Listen further. Decline.
8287 : Well, I guess it can't be helped, then... I'll just have to give up until someone can get some for me.
8288 : I've heard that % can be obtained from the monsters in Ordelle's Caves. It's pretty far, but hey, you're an adventurer, aren't you?
8289 : I've heard that % can be obtained from the monsters in Ordelle's Caves.
8290 : If we can get % too, then we'll be able to wipe away those smudges in a jiffy. Good luck in finding them.
8291 : Umm... Where was I... Umm... Oh, I just can't concentrate... I'm too worried about Hariga-Origa's work.
8292 : If only I had % and % to give him... Oh, can'taru you hurry up and find him some so we can erase the stains and get that book back to its rightaruful place?
8293 : Serukoko's not getting much transcription work done today.
8294 : She usually works so fast that we can't make out what she's saying! Perhaps she went too fast and tired herself outaru?
8295 : Oh, welcome back. Great. Now that I have these, we're set!
8296 : Here we go... Squeak, squeak, squeak... Swish, swish, swish!
8297 : Look! See how clean it is! Huh? What the...? Oh, my word!
8298 : The Book of the Gods is tightly guarded in the innermost parts of the Optistery. We do not know for sure what is contained in it, nor who wrote it.
8299 : As for this book... In the past, some wicked person had handed it to the Yagudo. The scholar who retrieved the book was able to reveal one of its secrets to us.
8300 : Wondering why the writing in the Book of the Gods doesn't need transcribing? It's because the writing is penned with water from the Full Moon Fountain!
8301 : Only the Star Sibyl can enter the Full Moon Fountain... Oh...does that mean the author is actually...???
8302 : Yikes...! Oh, my word! Oh my word! I just realized...this is a restricted book! It's forbidden to move it, let alone transcribe it!!!
8303 : What in heaven's name is a restricted book doing here!? As soon as I start reading its contents aloud, I'm going to be caught for sure!
8304 : Hey, you... Here, I'll give you this, so keep this whole incident quiet! Promise not to tell anyone, okay?
8305 : Eww... What if those smudges I removed from the book were bloodstains...?
8306 : Ooo-ah! Perhaps that was the famed blood-sucking book of yore!? Shivers! Thank goodness it wasn't hungry, otherwise it could have attacked me!
8307 : Umm... Where was I... Umm... Oh, I can't concentrate because I'm so worried! I hope Hariga-Origa can hurry up and get rid of that stain from my little juice-spilling incident.
8308 : Now I wish I never listened to the Minister of the Orastery's request. Oh, I'm too weak when it comes to assertive men...
8309 : Oh, so you want to know a little about magic, huh?
8310 : Well, you've come to the right place. We can teach you the basics...
8311 : Listen to their explanation? Decline. Accept.
8312 : Well then, let us explain... There are basically two types of magic...white and black.
8313 : White magic is predominately used for healing. It is what white mages specialize in. White magic includes healing spells such as Cure, and Poisona, which removes poison status...
8314 : High-level white mages can use Raise to revive fallen comrades.
8315 : Then there's black magic...
8316 : Hey, leave the explanation of black magic to me!
8317 : Black magic is used mainly for attacking. As you can tell from their names, black mages are pros at casting black magic.
8318 : Black magic has a strong connection to the elements, the magic power abundant in nature. That's why there are spells called Fire and Thunder, which correspond to the elements of fire and lightning.
8319 : Black magic is the best. Whenever you say magic-user, you immediately think of black mages, right?
8320 : Hold on there! Aren't the two of you forgetting a particularly important kind of magic? Magic isn't just about attacking things and healing people. Listen, and let me explain...
8321 : Do you know about enhancement magic? Spells such as Enfire and Phalanx can be cast on weapons and armor, adding a temporary magical aura to them.
8322 : To use such enhancement spells, you have to study both black and white magic.
8323 : That's why red mages are the best! Not only can you use both kinds of magic, but you can cast it on your weapons and stuff! Red mages always come in handy!
8324 : Oh yeah? But red mages can only use a little bit of black and white magic. I'd call them monochrome at best! They're so limited!
8325 : Calm down, guys... Cool it!
8326 : So, how about it? Do you understand more about magic now? We're currently studying the basics here at the School of Magic.
8327 : Actually, there is one more type of magic that is forbidden now, but I guess that doesn't concern an adventurer such as yourself. Anyway, good luck with your magic studies. Bye-bye.
8328 : I never thought when I was a wee child I'd grow up to be a teacher reviled.
8329 : My pet theory in my childhood, I stated, was that studying is overrated!
8330 : But now my pet theory is, I'm fated, that rather teaching is overrated!
8331 : This semester's students, you see, differ tremendously in ability. It's a pretty perplexing problem!
8332 : Aim at the able adolescent, and the late-learners are left lagging.
8333 : Lower the level and lo...the superiority and selectness of the students this school sends out suffer. How my haggard head hurts!
8334 : Every student is differently different. Unless one strives to understandingly understand each individual, one cannot educatedly educate in the fullest sense of the word.
8335 : At the very least, one should try to rememberingly remember their students' names... I'm not pointedly pointing the finger at anyone in particular here, but...
8336 : The School of Magic's system of determining your future while you are young is quite practical, really.
8337 : You don't have to fear an uncertain future, leaving you to enjoy the freedom of your youth. That way, you won't have any regrets as you get older, saying I wish I had more fun as a kid...
8338 : Today we will brush up on our level ten-and-above black magic spells.
8339 : School is a lot more fun than I expected. I'm glad I listened to my mother and enrolled here.
8340 : I made a lot of friends, and learning's fun when we're together.
8341 : Where's our teacher, you ask? The teachers are all in the staff room, of course!
8342 : In the advanced grade, we learn by ourselves and only go ask the teachers for help when we don't understand something.
8343 : We refer to the schedules the teachers prepare for us, but we decide by ourselves which magic we should learn next, and how many days we should spend on it.
8344 : I'm Koko Lihzeh, the School of Magic's first Mithra student.
8345 : I'm studying real hard so I can prrrove that Mithra can become as skilled as anyone else in the use of magic.
8346 : Tsk. Don't tell me another adventurer has wandered into our class with eyes wide open in wonder...
8347 : I know our school is liberal and open to all and all that, but I don't see why that means any ill-mannered trespasser can walk in and disturb our studies.
8348 : Here at the School of Magic, we've got famous teachers who excel in all the fields of magic. There's Ms. Fuepepe, who specializes in black magic, Mr. Pechiru-Mashiru, an expert in white magic, and Mr. Moreno-Toeno, who's a master in red enhancement magic.
8349 : Too bad each teacher has conflicting policies and methods of teaching. It sucks, 'cause us students are always confused over who to believe and what to do.
8350 : Heh-heh-heh. I, like, totally dig our black magic lessons, dude! They look so cool and have such wicked effects...those black mages' robes really rule!
8351 : When I graduate, I wanna enter the Orastery's Mage Academy. But it's the most popular ministry to go into. The position usually goes to the kid who gets the best grades. Dammit...
8352 : Our class's overachiever is Kirarara. She's the smarty-pants standing up there behind the lectern.
8353 : Aaargh! I, I, I still d-don't understand these at all! A-a-after a-all that pr-preparation...<sniff>
8354 : If you think of it as studying, then it's no fun, right? So pretend it's a memory game and...oh, what if you forget to pretend?
8355 : It's not that we in the beginners class can't do magic properly... It's just that those guys in the advanced class are too good at casting them spells.
8356 : It's true that you can only improve magic with plenty of practice. But the first step is to study a multitude of difficult books.
8357 : In order to read such tricky books, you have to have a sense of magic in the first place. It's kinda hard to explain, but it's like an ingrained feeling you just have.
8358 : I'm having twouble-wouble with my study-wudies, so I came from the beginners class to ask the teacher-weachers here for helpy-welpy.
8359 : But all the teachers-weachers say it's not their field of study-wudy, so I should asky-wasky another teacher-weacher. Is this what you call giving someone the wunawound?
8360 : Hey, how dare you there! You mustn't touch my teaching materials!
8361 : Huff! I don't have enough stuff as it is. Fumble-mumble-grumble...
8362 : Hey, you'll do! Can I ask you to do a tiny task, too?
8363 : Hear his humble mumble? Listlessly listen. Downright decline.
8364 : Please part promptly. Dumbly dawdling there is damned distracting!
8365 : I lack the indispensable items essential for my important lesson!
8366 : Seems the sum of students is the same, but the number of them making mistakes has multiplied. The level of the little learners lowers every year lately...
8367 : Anyway, attempt to acquire % and %.
8368 : Actually, acquiring % is amazingly arduous. But I best beg and beseech you, then bid you bye-bye!
8369 : Obtain one % and one % or I'll obstinately run out of replacements.
8370 : At last I can conduct a comely class!
8371 : Right...regarding your reward... Sorry it's not so stately a sum, but some is better than none...
8372 : This semester's students, you will see, differ tremendously in capability. It's a pretty perplexing problem!
8373 : Aim at the able adolescent and the late-learners are left lagging.
8374 : Lower the level and lo...the superiority and selectness of the students this school sends out suffers. How my haggard head hurts!
8375 : My dear adventurer... are you busy now? I have a problematic problem you may be able to help me with.
8376 : This is a matter that could sully our school's reputable reputation, so it is rather hard to ask, but... Yesterday, we had a burglary at our staff room here.
8377 : The only thing stolen was a pile of students' answer sheets. If it is possibly possible, I'd be greatly grateful if you could find them and bring them back to me.
8378 : Helpfully help the teacher out? Acceptingly accept. Decliningly decline.
8379 : I don't care who stolidly stole them. I just want my students' test answers back. Please help me.
8380 : I need to check the answers and see where each and every one of my students went wrong.
8381 : ......
8382 : It's my faulty fault. I should never have left them on my desk when I went outside. There's no forgiving my negligent negligence.
8383 : Please bring back the answer papers to me. Without them, I can't gradually grade my students. Learning starts from recognizably recognizing one's mistakes, you know?
8384 : What kind of person would pilfer Ms. Fuepepe's papers?
8385 : What would anyone want with them?
8386 : Tests are a load of mumbo jumbo, you bet! Even if the students cram for an exam, I regret, the moment it's over they all but everything forget.
8387 : A bit like life. And you ask why? You strive and strive, and then you die! And everyone forgets you. <sigh!>
8388 : Yesterday, a student from the advanced class named Chomoro-Kyotoro came looking for Ms. Fuepepe.
8389 : I wonder if he finally met Ms. Fuepepe? When I came back to my counter, he was already gone.
8390 : Test papers? What has that got to do with this lesson?
8391 : I'm pretty confident about my results for the written exam. In fact, I think I did better than Kirarara!
8392 : But poor Chomoro-Kyotoro is in hot water. If he gets less than 50%, it's back to the beginners class for him.
8393 : If I get above an 80% on the written test we had the other day, I'm gonna get a new wand!
8394 : But it's taking an awful long time for the test results to come back. I wonder what's taking so long?
8395 : Oww! I'm sure I totally failed my test. I forget everything as soon as I'm put under pressure.
8396 : If only I had thirty minutes more, I could have taken my time and relaxed a little.
8397 : I expect to get about 50%... That's 'cause I chose by intuition...not tuition.
8398 : But I got 90% in the test before last, so I don't have to worrrry about dropping down to beginnerrrs class.
8399 : Argh! Don't speak to me about that written test. I failed it totally, dude.
8400 : Once that test comes back, they're gonna make me study like crazy. Ahh...I wish that test would never come back!
8401 : During the test the other day, Chomoro-Kyotoro was as white as a moogle. I wonder what kinda results he's gonna get?
8402 : But I'm not worried, myself. I'm on easy street!
8403 : I-I-I'm pretty confident too, you know? I, I bet I'll get over 50%!
8404 : But, it's gre...I mean, too bad the results aren't coming back, huh? A-he-he-he-he...
8405 : Oh, looky-look at the answer sheets! They're all so tattered and torn. Why, I can't make heads or tails out of them.
8406 : But at least they're back in our possessive possession. Say, could you take them to the principal for me?
8407 : Please take the answer sheets to the principal. Thankingly thanking you.
8408 : ...Oh dearie-dear? Don't tell me you don't knowingly know who the principal is? Why, I thought everyone knew he was the eccentrically eccentric old man who livenly lives in a manor in Windurst Walls.
8409 : H-huh...!? You, you found the answer sheets!?
8410 : ...... R-really? All the answer sheets? A-a-are you sure...?
8411 : Goodness gracious! Chomoro-Kyotoro's answer paper was missing? My, isn't that strangely strange? Why, I counted them myself and was surely sure there was one from every student.
8412 : I guessingly guess it can't be helped then... We'll just have to make young master Chomoro-Kyotoro sit the test again.
8413 : He was a little under the weather last examination, so I hope his effortful efforts since then bear fruit and his resultant results this time 'round are better.
8414 : Here is your requitable requital. I hope you find it satisfactorily satisfactory. Thank you for your assisting assistance.
8415 : The principal himself has had the experienced experience of failing the grade and being sent down a class...quite a few timely times too, I may addingly add.
8416 : On the surface he appears inscrutably inscrutable, irresponsibly irresponsible and absurdly absurd, but he's actually considerately considerate, you know.
8417 : Huh? Wh-wh-what's that? The principal said I should have this?
8418 : !!!
8419 : ...... ...I-I'm sorry! Sorry for the trouble, I caused you. I-I promise I'll never do it again!
8420 : ... I-I-I promise I'll never do such a thing again!
8421 : I-I'll never throw this answer sheet away again. I-I now know you have to learn from your mistakes...
8422 : Hey, are you busy?
8423 : Busy...? No. Just a busybody. Yes. Busy as a bee!
8424 : Well then, buzz off!
8425 : Good, 'cause I have a favor to ask!
8426 : The other day, Mr. Moreno-Toeno gave us a homework assignment on the cultivation of plants.
8427 : I've got better things to do with my time than watch grass grow. I'd prefer to ask someone like you, who's not busy, to do it for me.
8428 : Help out with your green thumb? Thumbs up! Thumbs down!
8429 : Gee... It's not like I'm asking for an arm and a leg, or something. That's why I hate adults!
8430 : Great! Thanks. Then go plant % in a flowerpot for me, and check on them once a day until they grow into something that'll impress everyone.
8431 : Just telling you...I'm out to impress. You've got to grow at least %, or else I'm not paying you anything for your help, all right?
8432 : For me to be top of the class, then you'll at least need to grow % from %, okay?
8433 : Don't think I'll be cheap just 'coz I'm a kid. I'll reward you on how good a gardener you are.
8434 : Homework? What has that got to do with you?
8435 : The advanced class has been given a gardening homework assignment. It's used for experimenting on how the elements of crystals affect potted plants.
8436 : I was given grain seeds, so hopefully it will grow into %. But if it dies, does that make me a cereal killer?
8437 : Gardening is so easy, even gnomes could do it! All you have to do is throw the seeds into a pot and forget about them, right?
8438 : Whaddaya mean I'm wrong? So, I need to cast some spell on it or something? What, like Open Sesame or something?
8439 : Ohw!  I got some vegetable seeds...
8440 : I hope they don't grow into %. I just abhor that vegetable!
8441 : Our horticultural homework is required for the runts to realize the Rhinostery's remarkable role. Plus, it helps us pick which pupils have a particular talent in that area for recommendation to the Rhinostery.
8442 : When you grow the plant in a flowerpot and feed it a crystal at just the right time, you'll get a different result.
8443 : I rrreceived frrruit seeds! I'll trrry and grrrow some %.
8444 : I, I, I thought growing p-plants was supposed to be easy. L-l-like they just g-grow by themselves, r-right?
8445 : B-but I let mine b-be and they d-dried up! It's actually r-r-really hard!
8446 : I didn't tell you the due date, so I thought you wouldn't make it in time...
8447 : What in Vana'diel is this? Is this all you could grow? I'll get a zero for this! Zilch!
8448 : Didn't you study agriculture when you were a kid? The goal isn't just to stop the plant from withering, you know? I guess that's why you became an adventurer, huh? Ohw!
8449 : Humph! You only brought me what I asked for... I guess it would have been expecting too much for anything more than that, huh? Stick to adventuring next time...
8450 : I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to meet a higher-level adventurer?
8451 : Being stuck in this School of Magic all day means I don't get to meet many people.
8452 : Wow! Well done! What kinda crystal did you feed it to grow something like this?
8453 : I might even be able to beat Kirarara with this. You deserve every gil of your reward!
8454 : With this, I'll be able to beat Kirarara at last! But, wait... What if Kirarara also got an adventurer to help her with her homework, too?
8455 : What's wrong with asking others to do the stuff you can't do yourself?
8456 : It's much more efficient, and if you pay them a proper reward, then you both benefit. This is the ideology that keeps the world turning.
8457 : But Mr. Moreno-Toeno must be the only one who doesn't know that. Anyway, that's the reason why I'm having you help with my horticultural homework again.
8458 : I assume it's not appropriate to articulate this at an adventurer such as yourself, but...
8459 : Lately there's a lamentable lad who asks adventurers to arrange his homework for him. He worries me greatly!
8460 : If one overly relies on others, then when there isn't anyone around to assist you, you run aground! One needs to stand on one's own two feet.
8461 : <Nod...nod...doze...>
8462 : I'm soo sleepy, dude... I'm falling asleep on my feet here...
8463 : ...Huh!?  <Yawn!> What do you want? Stop bugging me!
8464 : <Nod...nod...doze...>
8465 : Paku-Nakku's attitude to learning is so bad. He's always half-asleep in class lately.
8466 : His consistent yawning gets on my nerves. If only there was some spell to stop yawning, I'd soon fix him!
8467 : Falling asleep in class shows you lack excitement and motivation in your daily life.
8468 : When he wakes up, the next thing Paku-Nakku will know is that he's been dropped down into the beginners class!
8469 : That has nothing to do with me.
8470 : That magic that Paku-Nakku showed off during practical training at the Orastery was really something!
8471 : But if the Orastary staff finds out, he'll get a real scolding!
8472 : What's up with Paku-Nakku? He's always dropping off to sleep in class lately.
8473 : He's usually the rowdiest one in class! I wonder if he's okay.
8474 : Durrring our magical prrractice the otherrr day, Paku-Nakku and Foi-Mui brrroke the rrrules and got extra homeworrrk as punishment.
8475 : I don't underrrstand why boys love to do forrrbidden stuff all the time.
8476 : I, I w-wonder how c-come Paku-Nakku c-can use all those d-different magic w-wands so w-well?
8477 : I-is h-he a n-natural b-born g-genius? I, I, I w-wish I w-was m-more l-like h-him!!
8478 : Hey, what's that you say? Paku-Nakku just sleeps all day?
8479 : That's strange indeed, I tell you...! The Sleep spell cast on Paku-Nakku should have worn off by now, too.
8480 : An accident occurring during a precarious practical at the Orastery's Mage Academy? This is true? Tsk, that's terrible! For one of our students to be so capriciously careless...
8481 : A teacher must take trouble to be true to their task. Sounds like some seriously slack supervision! That's through and through, one of Mr. Pechiru-Mashiru's lessons for you...
8482 : An accident with a Wand of Sleep...!? The other teachers said that? Oh *bleep*!
8483 : Magic practice at the Mage Academy is just tough luck! There's always one or two kids who run amuck! Put yourself in my position...I'm a sitting duck!
8484 : It's rather hard to say that Mr. Pechiru-Mashiru is respectingly respected by his studious students, let alone his peerless peers!
8485 : He should take a hardy hard look at himself as an educated educator.
8486 : ......
8487 : ...Huh...?
8488 : Drink...thissszzz...?
8489 : Nothing <yawn!> happened...!? <Nod...nod...doze...>
8490 : What? Oh, hell! Even after having drunk % well, Paku-Nakku still hasn't woken from the Sleep spell?
8491 : There's something fishy I smell... I'm sure I negated the Sleep spell that was cast on that Paku-Nakku rebel!
8492 : Let me look, by hook or by crook... I made him write his impressions of a book as punishment for the acts he took...
8493 : That's it, I bray! To wake him up right away, to Paku-Nakku you must say:
8494 : Wake up, fool! Rise now, I bid it! The automaton butler's the one who did it!
8495 : You got that?
8496 : To wake him up right away, to Paku-Nakku you must say...
8497 : Wake up, fool! Rise now, I bid it! The automaton butler's the one who did it! You got that?
8498 : Did Paku-Nakku yell at you? To be expected, that is true. Fear not, he'll soon get over it, too.
8499 : I never thought he'd go so reading beserk that it would affect his other classwork. Glad that's over, yes, my lord! By the way, here's a reward...
8500 : So Paku-Nakku went angry at you... I suppose it's only natural to. Don't worry, he'll soon get over it too.
8501 : ...Huh...?
8502 : The murderer was...? You! You did it! Me. Yes, I did it! The automaton butler did it!
8503 : Noooooo!!!
8504 : Ohhh maaan! I can't believe you gave away the ending! I was only halfway through reading Murder on the Jeuno Express, too!
8505 : I really hate you! I'll never forgive you for that! Go away!
8506 : ......???
8507 : ...Adventurer dude...
8508 : ...You have waaay too much time on your handsszzz...
8509 : I hate you sooo much, dude! I'll never forgive you! Go away!
8510 : What's all the noise about? You're disturbing the class.
8511 : If you and Paku-Nakku don't shut up, I'll cast Silence on the both of you!
8512 : Looks like Paku-Nakku finally woke up. What spell did you use on him?
8513 : Anyway, thank you, I guess. Even if he is such a pain, I still want us all to graduate together.
8514 : What have you got to do with me?
8515 : You're so mean! Giving away the ending of a book to someone who's still reading it is just bad manners.
8516 : I'm glad I finished that book before Paku-Nakku did. Otherwise you would have spoiled it for me as well.
8517 : Ooowww......
8518 : I hadn't read that book yet! <sniff>
8519 : What, so you didn't know? Paku-Nakku was tirrred lately because he was hooked on the Agatha Crystalie mysterrry serrries.
8520 : They are so cool! I just love Detective Poiroto-Boiroto and Miss Marpelpel... Unforrrtunately, the librarrry doesn't have the last book in the series yet...
8521 : Wo-wow, the A-agatha Cr-Crystalie whodunit s-series!? I-if they're th-that g-good, m-maybe I sh-should r-read th-them too!
8522 : B-but, I'm a s-slow r-reader. I d-don't w-want to k-keep the n-next p-person w-waiting, s-so m-maybe I sh-should w-wait till e-everyone e-else h-has f-f-finished r-r-reading th-them...
8523 : Recently my big sister joined some good-for-nothing organization.
8524 : She won't tell me what kind of things they're up to. This is the start of her fall into delinquency! Next thing I know, it's going to break my family up!
8525 : I'm trying to think of ways to shut my kid brother up, but the little brat is always making such a fuss I can't hear myself think.
8526 : HUH??? WHAT'S THATARU SAY? SPEAK UP THERE, YOUNG'UN... I'M A LITTLE DEAF!
8527 : HWAH...! NOW I GIT YA! WELL THEN, HOW ABOUTS... IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE, THEN DON'T SAY ANYTHING ATARULL!? THAT HELP YA?
8528 : You came to ask our gramps for pearls of wisdom, huh? He was once a famous wandering fortune-teller.
8529 : So if you keep that in mind when you listen to him, you kind of feel like his sayings have some sorta hidden meaning. Tee-hee.
8530 : ...<sniff>. Leave me alone...
8531 : I, I, I... can't take it... ANYMOOORE!!!
8532 : The boy in the house opposite here has been down in the dumps lately.
8533 : The poor thing flunked the School of Magic several times until he gave up trying to become one of the elite. He then tried his hand at the auction house until there was an accident. Now he's resting at home waiting for his wounds to heal.
8534 : I guess you could say he was unlucky, or in the wrong place at the wrong time, or he was just plain asking for it... Oops... Maybe that last one's taking it a bit too far.
8535 : Ahhh... What should I do? Oh, woe, woe, woe is me!
8536 : <Sigh>...
8537 : Oh, the sunshine, how it sparkle-warkles... Oh, the unfulfilled desires that spill out of my hearty...
8538 : Oh, how much nicer it would be if I could become a flower swaying in the breeze...
8539 : Ah, a flower? That's it!!!
8540 : Hey, you, you, you...! Could you please go to the Rhinostery and get me a flower?
8541 : Say it with flowers? Yeah, flower-power! No. Nip it in the bud!
8542 : The rarest, mysticalest, elegantest flower there is!
8543 : Oohh... How could you... Just when I had a bloomin' good idea...
8544 : All as I wanted was for you to buy me a flower...
8545 : The rarest, mysticalest, elegantest flower there is!
8546 : What a blooming good idea! Now that it's arranged, I've got to do all the preparations that stem from it!
8547 : You want a flower? What kind do you want?
8548 : Firstly-wirstly...? The brightest... The fragrentest... The rarest...
8549 : Secondly-wecondly... The mysticalest... The cheeriest... The beautifulest...
8550 : And, thirdly-wirdly... The remarkablest flower. The elegantest flower. The popularest flower.
8551 : Well then, that'll be %. Here, it's # gil, please.
8552 : Alright, % it is then. Here, that'll be # gil, please.
8553 : So, you'll be wanting %, then. Here, that's # gil, thank you.
8554 : Sorry, but we don't have that sort of flower in stock right now.
8555 : What do you mean, you don't have enough gil? Well, you can't expect to buy our flowers without money, can you?
8556 : Hmm... The flower you talk of does exist, but...
8557 : I think Kerutoto is using the last one we have in some kind of experiment. She's in the meditation chamber next door.
8558 : Hey, Kenapa-Keppa! Where do you actually get % from?
8559 : ...Umm...well...?
8560 : Guess you should go ask Kenapa-Keppa where you can get them, so you can go get your own %. It's probably somewhere dangerous, but hey, at least you'll be getting it for free.
8561 : You should go ask Kenapa-Keppa where you can pick your own %. It's probably somewhere pathetically dangerous, but at least you'll be getting one for free.
8562 : Thank you and ta-taru!
8563 : ......?
8564 : ...Umm...
8565 : ...They're...found...in...
8566 : ...Tah...ron...gi...Can...yon...
8567 : ...But...
8568 : ...it's...dan...ger...ous...!
8569 : Zzz... Mmm...<mumble-mumble>...
8570 : West of the Crag of Mea......
8571 : Oh, what a wonderful flower!
8572 : Oh, I'm so glad I asked you! Thanks, bud! Here, as a token of my appreciation.
8573 : Ah...... Now all I need to do is write a letter to express my heartfelt feelings...
8574 : Ah...... Now all I need to do is write a letter to express my heartfelt feelings...
8575 : Is this flower really...
8576 : ...the rarest, mysticalest, elegantest flower there is!?
8577 : ...Well, I guess it set you back about this much, right...?
8578 : Oh, excuse me, but... I don't think that flower you brought me will work...<sigh>...
8579 : Sorry to put you out again, but could you go to the Rhinostery and get me another?
8580 : Yes, this is it...
8581 : ...The rarest, mysticalest, elegantest flower there is!!! That's what I want!
8582 : Yes, this is it...
8583 : ...The rarest, mysticalest, elegantest flower there is!!! That's what I want!
8584 : This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where a Mog House has been prepared for your use.
8585 : Let me see... Have I explained Mog Houses to you before? If not, please allow me to.
8586 : Listen to Mog House explanation? Yes. No.
8587 : A Mog House is a personal apartment that we've provided for your convenience.
8588 : Within your Mog House, you can carry out such activities as storing items, changing jobs, and healing HP and MP.
8589 : As you are a citizen of Windurst, there's already a Mog House prepared for you. You'll find it up the stairs behind me.
8590 : You are completely free to use the room as you see fit. Why, you can even arrange it to suit your own bad tastes.
8591 : This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where a Mog House has been prepared for your use.
8592 : Let me see... I've explained Mog Houses to you before, right? Do you want to hear me explanation again?
8593 : Well, that put a damper on my day...
8594 : This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where a Mog House has been prepared for your use.
8595 : Hmm... Hey! You currently have a Rent-a-Room leased out in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kahzam/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], right?
8596 : Do you want us to return the Rent-a-Room in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kahzam/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], and bring back all your belongings from there to your Mog House here in Windurst?
8597 : Move out of Rent-a-Room? Yes. No.
8598 : There you go. The procedure is finished. The keys to your Rent-a-Room in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kahzam/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi] have been returned and you are free to rest in your Mog House here.
8599 : This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for your use.
8600 : Let me see... You already have a Rent-a-Room leased at the moment, right? Well then, you are free to go through the archway behind me and use the Rent-a-Room as you would your Mog House back in your own country.
8601 : This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for people's use.
8602 : Let me see... You're not a citizen of Windurst, are you? That means you can only lease a Rent-a-Room.
8603 : When you lease a Rent-a-Room here, you can use that room as you would use your personal Mog House back in your home country. Isn't it just kupo convenient?
8604 : Lease a Rent-a-Room? Yes. No.
8605 : There you go. The procedure is complete. You now have your own Rent-a-Room in Windurst's residential area, located right behind me. Have a nice stay.
8606 : What's the mattaru?
8607 : Oh... Seeing you standing there gazing into the distance, I thought you were looking at something interesting. Seems as though you were just taking in the atmosphere of peaceful old Windurst.
8608 : But I couldn't say that these are the most peaceful times Windurst has seen...
8609 : If the Great Tree were to wither up and die, this whole country would pass away with it. Sadly, that end could be nigh...
8610 : Ajido-Marujido!!! Are you bothering another poor adventurer?
8611 : Excuse my big brother, friend. I am sure you were in the middle of something important before he rudely interrupted you.
8612 : You've got it all wrong again, Apururu. This poor adventurer was lost, so I kindly offered to help. Isn't that rightaru?
8613 : Is that so? Excuse me for asking, but...you wouldn't happen to be new to Windurst, would you?
8614 : First time in Windurst? Yes. No.
8615 : Well then, allow me to give you some tips. Windurstians are obliged to show kindness to those new to our neighborhood.
8616 : So, what do you want to know? Is there anything you need to do in particular? If so, don't be afraid to ask sweet Apururu!
8617 : Oh, really? Are you trying to trick us city folk into thinking you're not some yokel or country bumpkin?
8618 : Oh, don't get the wrong impression. We just haven't seen you around these parts before...
8619 : So, hey, erm... Where are you heading? Do you want to chat a little?
8620 : Find out about...? Going outside to battle. Where to shop. Gathering information. Where am I and who are you?
8621 : Goodness-woodness! You've just arrived, and the first thing you want to do is run off to fightaru?
8622 : Heh, brawn over brain, huh? As I always say, a life lived short is a life lived well!
8623 : Ajido-Marujido!!! Bite your tongue!
8624 : Why? It's true, isn'taru it?
8625 : I'm ignoring my brother... The quickest way for you to die a horrible, unnecessary death is to go back along that road behind us.
8626 : That will lead you to a stone gatehouse. On the other side of the town gates is Sarutabaruta. It's dangerous out there, so be careful.
8627 : Say, you know how to check a monster and see how strong it is before you attack it, rightaru?
8628 : Target your opponent and choose Check from the action menu. This will tell you the creature's strength relative to your current level.
8629 : Don't attack opponents who you can't beataru. If you get into trouble, you can always select Call for Help to ask for assistance from the people around you...
8630 : ...But whether or not there are fellow adventurers nearby who want to lend you a hand is another mattaru.
8631 : If no one comes to your help, well, that's just your bad luck, I suppose.
8632 : Yes, my brother is correct for once...even though his manners could use some work.
8633 : ......
8634 : Oh, and if you gather too many items to hold, head on down to Windurst's residential area.
8635 : Each and every Windurstian citizen has their own personal residence, or Mog House, set aside for them. You can store your items in your room's Mog Safe.
8636 : The residential area of Windurst is to the east of here. Head over the bridge into the neighboring Windurst Walls district and go to the right.
8637 : I'm sure these pearls of wisdom will help you as you set out on your new adventures. Don't forgetaru them, now!
8638 : Enough already! So much information at once is bound to confuse even the smartest Tarutaru. Besides, I don't have the time to be offering newbie-woobies free tours of our town.
8639 : Wait a second, brother-wother!
8640 : Sorry, but I have to go, too. If you need to know more, just ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol in the vicinity of the Huntman's Court.
8641 : Here. If you give him this, I'm sure he'll reward you. To pass him the item, target him and select Trade from the main menu.
8642 : I hope we meet again soon. Good luck, adventurer!
8643 : Now you're talking my language! Shopping is my specialty.
8644 : There are three shops in the Windurst Waters area: a general goods store, a magic dealer, and a milliner.
8645 : Firstly-wirstly, the general goods store, Ensasa's Catalyst Shop, is a fine place for your basic shopping needs.
8646 : Not too pricey, and with good service. I recommend it for items such as potions and ether, but they have quite a selection of other items, too.
8647 : Secondly-wecondly, there's the Federal Magic Reserve, and thirdly-wirdly, Baren-Moren the Hatter. These are both to the south of here, across the bridge.
8648 : Baren-Moren the Hatter, as his name implies, deals in all kinds of headwear.
8649 : Hee-hee. We Tarutaru take great pride in our headwear. A hat speaks volumes about the kind of Tarutaru you are.
8650 : The hatter, Baren-Moren, is always looking for help in publicizing his wares. Many a new adventurer has earned pocket money there.
8651 : The Federal Magic Reserve next door to Baren-Moren's is one of two magic shops in Windurst. It deals in higher-level magic.
8652 : But you're just a beginner, so I don't think you'll be needing their services rightaru away. Then again, it pays to know these things for the future.
8653 : If you're looking for beginner's magic or slightly stronger weapons and equipmentaru, you can always head to the port area, you know?
8654 : To get to Port Windurst, head though the tunnel south of Baren-Moren's and the Federal Magic Reserve.
8655 : The port area has a weapon shop, an armorer, and a magic shop, all in a row of quaint little boats docked on the wharves. I would even recommend it just for the scenery.
8656 : But as we shopping specialists know, you need plenty of money...cold, hard gil...to buy what you wantaru.
8657 : You can gain gil by selling raw materials and other items gained from defeating the monsters outside of town.
8658 : Well, that's about all the advice I have for the novice adventurer.
8659 : Hee-hee. Shopping is great fun, but be careful not to waste money on things you don't really need.
8660 : If you need to know more, just ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.
8661 : Here. If you give Jacky-wacky this, I'm sure he'll reward you somehow. To pass him the item, target him and select Trade from the main menu.
8662 : I hope we meet again soon. Good luck, my new adventurer friend!
8663 : ...Phew! Impossible to get a word in edgewise, isn't it? She may be my little sister, but I don't understand her at all.
8664 : Well, I'd best be off, too. See you around, I suppose. Ta-taru!
8665 : Duh! That's easy-weasy. Just walk around the whole town and talk to anybody and everybody.
8666 : Oh, Ajido-Marujido!!! Bite your tongue!
8667 : Let me see... I can tell you all the helpful information I know. Anything in particular you're interested in?
8668 : Ask about...? Helping people. Monster patrol. Easy money. Looking for work.
8669 : If you're volunteering to help, then please come to my ministry. It's called the Manustery, and is located in Windurst Woods. That's the district southeast of here.
8670 : My members and I will tell you the details when you turn up. We'd be most appreciative of an extra hand.
8671 : Humph. Watch out if you're going to deal with her. She loves to boss people around. Especially new arrivals like yourself.
8672 : How dare you, Ajido-Marujido! Why don't you shut your mouth!
8673 : Anyway, if you get stuck or don't know what to do, try asking other adventurers for advice.
8674 : Only my brother is such a nasty, lying fiend. The rest of the people should be comparatively nicer.
8675 : What did you call me!? That's rich, coming from fuddy-duddy, hoity-toity, you! Don't forget who's been looking after you all these years!
8676 : Well, I never! I don't have the time for this nonsense. I'm off!
8677 : Hey!  Wait up, Ajido-Marujido!
8678 : Sorry, but I have to go, too. If you need to know more, ask our friend Jack of Hearts who is on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.
8679 : Here. If you give Jacky-wacky this, I'm sure he'll reward you somehow. To pass him the item, target him and select Trade from the main menu.
8680 : Bye-bye, and good luck, my new adventurer friend! Please drop by my Manustery when you're in Windurst Woods.
8681 : Tsk. Adventurers these days... You shouldn't go around saying that when it's your first time in a big city. You're sure to run into trouble.
8682 : Don't be too hard on novice adventurers. I think it's only rational to first improve one's economic standing before setting out on a new adventuring enterprise.
8683 : In fact, I think I know justaru the right person to help you out...
8684 : Oh, really? Who would ever tell you that they need help...?
8685 : The hatter! Lately he's been calling out to my students, telling them that he'll give them some pocket money if they help him show off his wares.
8686 : I'd say that the shape of your head isn't too displeasing, so you might be able to earn some money...
8687 : Well, if you count that type of job as easy then, yes, it could be considered easy money, but...
8688 : ...See, then it's up to how well our friend performs. The more effort one puts in, the more one will earn!
8689 : I guess so. Well, good luck with it! I hope to see you again soon.
8690 : If you need to know more, ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.
8691 : Here. If you give Jacky-wacky this, I'm sure he'll reward you somehow. To pass him the item, target him and select Trade from the main menu.
8692 : The dhalmel farmer up near the Manustery seems to be having a pest problem. She's been asking for help in reducing the number of Crawlers in these parts.
8693 : Speak to Illu Bohjaa. She's a Mithra who looks after the dhalmels at the dhalmel farm in Windurst Woods.
8694 : Windurst Woods is the southeastern district of Windurst. Follow that little road eastwards, through Windurst Walls, on to the Woods district.
8695 : It's quite a distance from Windurst Waters, but those dhalmels have such long necks, you should be able to spot them from a malm away.
8696 : I hate that place. Windurst Woods is all so higgledy-piggledy, I get lost every time I try to walk through it.
8697 : Really? If you just follow the path around, you'll find the dhalmel farm and Manustery relatively easily.
8698 : But I don't go to those places. I usually go to... ...... ............
8699 : Oh, no! I totally forgotaru! I should be preparing for my experiment. Sorry. I've got to run!
8700 : Oh brother-wother! What evil scheme are you up to now? Hold on a second!
8701 : If you need to know more, ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.
8702 : Here. If you give Jacky-wacky this, I'm sure he'll reward you somehow. To pass him the item, target him and select Trade from the main menu.
8703 : Good luck! I hope we meet again, soon. Ta-taru!
8704 : That's easy. If you're looking for work, then head on over to one of the gatehouses.
8705 : Follow that road behind you and it'll lead you to a big stone building. That's the north gatehouse.
8706 : Gatehouses are special places that hand out missions on behalf of the Federation of Windurst.
8707 : When you successfully complete missions obtained from the gatehouses, the town guards will increase your rank points.
8708 : Collect enough rank points and your rank, or position within this country, will rise.
8709 : Oh, and you're currently rank one, by the way.
8710 : In other words, you're the lowest of the low, the weakest of the weak...
8711 : ...Pay no attention to my brother.
8712 : You can only accept one mission at a time, but if you do each one properly, your rank is sure to go up in no time at all.
8713 : Yeah, and then you'll be second-lowest of the low, the second most weakest of the weak...
8714 : Oh, shut up already!
8715 : Missions are done for the love of your country, so don't expect to make much money out of them. But give them your best shot! Not all rewards can be measured in gil.
8716 : As you increase in rank, you can gain better things than gil can buy.
8717 : Yeah, if your rank goes up enough, you might even be able to talk to us on equal footing.
8718 : If you need to know anything else, ask our friend, Jack of Hearts. He's on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.
8719 : Here. If you give old Jack this, I'm sure he'll reward you. To pass him it, target him and select Trade from the main menu.
8720 : That's all the help I can give you for now. Well, see you around, newbie.
8721 : Ah! Wait up, Ajido-Marujido.
8722 : My brother always does things his own way, regardless of others.
8723 : Good luck, adventurer! Hope to see you around someday. Bye-bye!
8724 : This is Tarutaru. We are Windurst. You are our new slave...
8725 : Oh, Ajido-Marujido!!! Bite your tongue!
8726 : This place is called Windurst Waters. It is the oldest of the four districts of Windurst, and has been the center of Tarutaru life for ages.
8727 : In Windurst, there are five educational and governmental ministries. The ministers themselves support the Star Sibyl, who rules over Windurst.
8728 : Three of the ministries are here in Windurst Waters. Many Tarutaru are involved in studying a variety of subjects at these institutions.
8729 : These three ministries are known as the Optistery, Rhinostery, and Aurastery. Respectively, they administrate a library, biological laboratory, and magic school.
8730 : You'll also find several Tarutaru-run shops in this area.
8731 : There's a hostelry, a general goods store, a milliner...oh, and the Culinarians' Guild, and the tavern... It will take you more than a day to see all the sights.
8732 : Ah, and one shouldn't forget the residential area. Follow the little road that leads to Windurst Walls and turn right to find the entrance.
8733 : In Windurst's residential area, there is a Mog House for you to store items and rest up in. Talk to the guards at the entranceway for the details.
8734 : Ummm... What else were you asking aboutaru...?
8735 : Huh?  Oh yeah, just who in Vana'diel are we...!?
8736 : Hee-hee. Well, if you haven't figured it out already, I'm Apururu. Nice to meetaru you.
8737 : Oh, yeah, and I'm Ajido-Marujido. It'll pay to remember me.
8738 : Well, I guess you still have plenty of questions to ask, but we have to get going now.
8739 : I suggest you ask your fellow adventurers for help. Vana'diel is a huge place, so you'll need to make as many friends as you can.
8740 : Hah! Friends... I had better warn you...don't go around telling people you're my friend, rightaru?
8741 : Ah, Ajido-Marujido! Wait up a moment!
8742 : Oh, before I go, here, take this. Give it to our friend, Jack of Hearts, who is on patrol near the Huntsman's Court.
8743 : Jacky-wacky is a good little Cardian who will tell you anything else you need to know. To pass him the coupon, target him and select Trade from the main menu.
8744 : I hope to see you around some time. Good luck, my shiny-whiny adventurer friend. Ta-taru!
8745 : What's that, a-tat-tat? Principal Koru-Moru is secretly searching for something special?
8746 : A burnite shell...? Well, oh well...! Say, if it's shells you're seeking, your should speak to a son of the sea.
8747 : A book on Alchemy, eh? I'd love to take a look at one myself, I say.  But they were all banned years ago. 'Twas said that they were a bad influence on children, you know?
8748 : I'm not certain whether they really were or not. All I do know is--if I haven't forgot-- that getting your hands on one now will be close to impossible, I avow!
8749 : Principal Koru-Moru is searching for a scholar knowledgeable in the art of Alchemy, eh? Still the dilly-dallier, I see...
8750 : I wonder if he's seriously considering studying something so sinister as Alchemy? If so, he's not setting a good example for his students, is he, eh?
8751 : Alchemical Alchemy? Now that you mention it, ever so long ago, a student wrote a graduation thesis on such a dubiously dubious topic...
8752 : If I rememberingly remember, the principal at the time orderly ordered that student to stay back another year.
8753 : What? You wantingly want to read that student's graduation thesis?
8754 : It shouldn't be a problematic problem... Ask Katzun-Nattzun at the Acolyte Hostel to help find it for you.
8755 : The hostel is the humongously huge building to the north of here.
8756 : Graduation theses are tests to indicatingly indicate whether the students are able to graduate from the School of Magic.
8757 : Katzun-Nattzun should knowingly know where that thesis is. You'll find him in the Acolyte Hostel, a humongously huge building to the north of here.
8760 : What a fine sailor's cap... Such a shame it's so terribly torn...
8761 : And these are made out of leather, too... It would be a damn sight quicker to make a new one.
8762 : To-ho-ho... Might as well try full-scale surgery to see if we can resurrect the poor blighter.
8763 : Listen up. I'll need four % to save this worn and torn sailor...and a little bit of luck as well.
8764 : To-ho-ho... Might as well try full-scale surgery to see if we can resurrect the poor blighter.
8765 : Listen up. I'll need four % to save this worn and torn sailor...and a little luck as well.
8766 : Wish me luck, 'cause here it goes...
8767 : Tada The operation was a success! To tell you the truth, I had been working on it using some of the leather I had lying around here. To-ho-ho.
8768 : Oh, and here, I also made a little something for you, too...
8769 : To-ho-ho! I just made it using the scraps of leather I had left over, but it's quite a dandy little design, isn't it?
8770 : To-ho-ho! Not that it would happen, but if you ever lost your % again, just bring me four %, and I'll make you a new one.
8771 : % to disguise yourself with, dearie? Oh...like Detective Poiroto-Boiroto in those Agatha Crystalie mystery series?
8772 : Oh, my daughter put you up to this? Well then, I guess it can't be helped...
8773 : If you can collect four lumps of the fluffy cotton wool that the monsters in Tahrongi Canyon drop, I'll try and make you one.
8774 : This should be enough. Hair nose, oops, I mean... Here goes...
8775 : In the books, Detective Poiroto-Boiroto could change his appearance in a blink of the eye. That's why he's also known as the Mastaru of Disguise!
8776 : Isn't he the mostest!?
8777 : A while ago, I borrowed a chocobo so I could go on a fishing trip. But zee silly chocobo went and caught a cold.
8778 : To make up for eet, I took some of my special stew to zee stables so zee chocobo could drink eet... Oh, so you want moi to make some of zat stew for you?
8779 : I think it eez possible, but zee special stew I made that time had % in eet. You'll have to bring moi three of zose little champignons...
8780 : Without zose special mushrooms, eet will just be a plain old stew.
8781 : Zee % can be found in Jugner Forest, I believe.
8782 : Zey grow on zee bodies of zee toadstool monsters that lurk zere. Zey look grotesque and smell awful, but zee taste ees just exquisite!
8783 : I need about three % in order to make zat special stew for you.
8784 : In order to get zose mushrooms, I recommend you try Jugner Forest. You should be able to collect zem by defeating zose toadstool monsters zat lurk zere.
8785 : Zat's it! Once you've tried a dish with zese in zem, you'll keep coming back for more.
8786 : One moment pleeze. I'll add a leettle of zis and a leettle of zis and...
8787 : Voil! Zis should get zat chocobo back on his feet again!
8788 : Make sure you bring eet to heem while eet's still warm.
8789 : Zat should get our chocobo friend back on his feet again!
8790 : Make sure you serve it to heem while eet's still warm.
8791 : I'm sure you've heard by now that there are five ministries in Windurst, haven'taru?
8792 : This building houses one of those ministries, the Optistery, which runs a Library of Magic. For ages, they have been in chargey-wargey of the preservation of Windurst's books and scrolls.
8793 : Welcome to the magical city of Windurst! Have you checked out the whole town yetaru? What's that...? You're having trouble talking with us Tarutaru?
8794 : Well, we may be small and speak a little funny-wunny, but we're the best when it comes to using magic! If you have time, you should stop by the School of Magic and see how we learny-wearny!
8795 : The research of magic is malms ahead in Windurst compared to the other countries. That's because the land in these parts was originally overflowing with magical power-wower.
8796 : In Sarutabaruta, the land that surrounds Windurst, you'll find the Horutoto Ruins. They're incredibly ancient remnants from a sorcerous society!
8797 : Don'taru you think the world's become all so rowdy-dowdy lately? The Manustery making Cardians like there's no tomorrow... The Orastery has gone and allowed the sale of high-level magic...
8798 : A guy's got to think of an escape plan in case the whole place gets pulled into a war or something.
8799 : Ahaha... You're such a worrywart. There won't be another war!
8800 : So long as the Star Sibyl blesses us with her presence, the peace of Windurst is a given.
8801 : I've come here to return the book I borrowed-worrowed from the Optistery's library. I'd really like to have kept it out a little longer, but...
8802 : See, you have to return it back by the due date. If you don't, the magic placed on the books can fadey-wadey, and all the letters in the book will vanish in an instant!
8803 : Do you know of them beastymens? Them be some smaaart monster-wonsters! They's attack peoples and steal peoples's stuff and all sorts of other nasty-wasty things.
8804 : But they say them Yagudo aren't baaad beastymens. Them not like them other beastymens, they says. But is it true-wrue...? I wonders!
8805 : When my daddy-waddy still had his health, he fought them Yagudo. He says all four countries united their powers to defeat the king of the beastymens at a castle waay up northy-worthy. I wish I lived back then.
8806 : Ew! An indescribable smell occasionally comes wafting across from that building over yonder-wonder.
8807 : That's the Culinarians' Guild, isn't it? What in Vana'diel are they cooking-wooking in there?
8808 : That's the Culi...Culin...Culnira...Cooks' Guild! We's all likes Ranpi-Monpi who works there. He lets us taste all sortsa great stuff!
8809 : He sez I've an iron-clad tummy-wummy, so I comes in mighty useful!
8810 : Nanah-nananah! Before a new dish gets added to the menu at the westaurant over there, we's alweady tasted it! I bet you're jealous, 'coz we're sooo wucky!
8811 : Let kids be kids is what I say. Even if they're mischievous and hate to study, it's fine, so long as they are sound and well.
8812 : Though it wouldn't hurt for them to master a few magical techniques, just in case the Yagudo Theomilitary decides to bear their beaks like they did twenty years ago...
8813 : My mommy-wommy works in that shoppy-woppy there! When you comes back from your twavels outside, you just gotta stop by there!
8814 : Want to learn how to use a little magic? You should stop by the School of Magic, which is run by the Aurastery. It's across the bridge here and up to your left.
8815 : Oh... It's probably quicker to ask the students than the teachers. The educatees there are more eager scholars than the educators.
8816 : Have you seen the Great Star Tree, the symbol of Windurst's peace? In the old days, we celebrated a Festival of the Stars where the Star Sibyl made the tree suddenly bloom with nuts.
8817 : In the good old days, it was the custom to hold a Festival of the Stars as a welcoming after the Star Reading ceremony.
8818 : But that was in the years before the war... After an ill-omened fortune was told in the Star Reading ceremony, we stopped conducting the Festival of the Stars.
8819 : Across the bridge to the south of here is Baren-Moren's hat shop, and the Rhinostery with its biological laboratory.
8820 : Further to the south is Windurst's port area. Ah, how I'd love to have a new hat made! I could wear it as I set off on a trip across the open skies...
8821 : Among the guards of Windurst are the automatons who speaky-weaky in the words of the stars.
8822 : They are the Cardians, magical puppet-like dolly-wollys that are made at the Manustery.
8823 : Once in several hundred years, a great wizard is born out of the Tarutaru in Windurst. This wizard is so powerful, he is called the Mastermind of the Millenium.
8824 : Decades ago, a child formidable enough to carry that title graduated at the top of his class from the School of Magic. I'm sure you'll hear his name mentioned as the hero who saved Windurst.
8825 : The Horutoto Ruins in Sarutabaruta are also called the magic towers, and are said to have the power to control the monsters of Sarutabaruta.
8826 : But they were damaged terribly-werribly during the war. Now, most of the magical gizmos in there don't work anymore.
8827 : Ahhh... If only those magic towers could be restored, the Sarutabaruta region could have peace once more.
8828 : With all the powers that the elite scholars of Windurst have, you'd think we could repair the Horutoto Ruins right away. The engineering skills of the ancients must be more complicated than we think. It's most disappointing-wointing.
8829 : But speaking of scholars, I wonder what happened to all the combat scholars that made up a large portion of the Federation's ranks during the Crystal War. It was rumored that there were more than a handful of suspicious characters among them.
8830 : Please, oh pleeeeeease. Can'taru you buy me just one more hat?
8831 : I need one for daytime and one for nighttime. That means I need eight more hats!
8832 : Enough is enough, already-weddy! Eight hats are sufficientaru for all the days of the week.
8833 : In the Tarutaru estates area here, the biggest and grandest house is inhabited by a super-rich Tarutaru.
8834 : But he's the perfect picture-wicture of a miser. When you just walk by his house, he judgmentally glares down at you as if you are a pauper-wauper or something. I can't stand it!
8835 : This certainly-wertainly is the road to the School of Magic. But what business do you have there? Aren't you a little old to be applying for school?
8836 : My daughter's in the School of Magic. She spends her days working hard at her studies there.
8837 : Does she realize her daddy-waddy is here on this hill every day worrying about her? Is she eating her lunchy-wunchy properly? Is she being teased by the class bully-wully?
8838 : Daughter dearest!  Your Daddy-waddy's here, cheering you on! You go girl! Woo-hoo!
8839 : In the School of Magic, there is an advanced class for the smarty-warties and a beginners class for the mediocre students.
8840 : What's that!? You think you can enter the advanced class, huh? Well, the last year had a Mithra pass the grade, so maybe even you could give it a try...?
8841 : Grrr... I don't have enough gil to buy anything worrrthwhile. Guess I've got to head back out to Sarrrutabarrruta and hunt some more rarrrabs.
8842 : Doesn't seem like therrre's any good offerrrs for half-baked adventurrrerrrs like you and me. Betterrr off sticking to rabbiting forrr the time being.
8843 : What was it called again? You know, the grrreat, whopping whatchamacallit monsterrr that stopped appearrring, allowing old Windurst to returrrn to its peaceful state?
8844 : Back in the old days, when therrre was a full moon, the Tarutaru would lock and barrr theirrr doorrrs, too afrrraid to even peek outside.
8845 : Aren't you an adventurer from [San d'Oria/Bastok]? Instead of staying in a hostelry, wouldn't it be cheaper for you to stay in a Rrrent-a-Rrroom in Windurst's rrresidential area?
8846 : The rrresidential area is east of here. Cross the bridge there and turn rrright where the Cardian is on guard.
8847 : Hey, aren't you a Windurstian? Instead of staying at a hostelry, why don't you use your Mog House in Windurst's rrresidential area? It's free, isn't it?
8848 : The rrresidential area is east of here. Cross the bridge there and turn rrright where the Cardian is on guard.
8849 : Therrre's a strrrange lady staying in the rrroom on the second floor of the hostelrrry. She's funny, even forrr a Hume!
8850 : But she's loved by the Tarrrutarrru. I guess it's trrrue what they say about chocobos of a featherrr flocking togetherrr.
8851 : Ahh!? Maybe, just maybe...she could be a prrrincess underrr some wicked spell?
8852 : That building therrre is a hat shop, of all things. Don't you think it shows how carefrrree a rrrace those Tarutaru are to make such a whimsical business?
8853 : Hats arrre totally useless! Give me a properrr armorrr helmet any day!
8854 : When I look at these flowerrrs, I feel like having a drrrink. But then again, I feel like having a drrrink all of the time.
8855 : If only I had some fluoro-flora juice. It's as bitterrr as uncooked gysahl greens, but the taste rrreminds me of home.
8856 : The orrriginal fluoro-flora seeds are from the Mithra homeland, you see...
8857 : Huh... So this is the biological laborrratory that is rrrun by the Rhinostery, eh? Doesn't seem so exciting, rrreally...
8858 : I hearrrd that they carry out some weirrrd experiments herrre. Do you know anything about that?
8859 : Those strange plants that glow in the dark? They say that they make them in the Rhinostery.
8860 : How do you make plants that glow? Windurst is truly a land of wonders. Why, I heard rumors that during the Crystal War, the ministry spent a great deal of Federation funding on queer biotechnological experiments such as the development of sleep-inducing fruit and vegetables that would not spoil for years.
8861 : The residents here are a timid people, yet they know very well the beauty of the night. I'm amazed that they can create such exquisite plants.
8862 : Phew... I finally made it! So this is the city of Windurst...?
8863 : I had a nasty experience when I was attacked by those awful Yagudo out there in Sarutabaruta. All that talk of the Tarutaru and Yagudo being on friendly terms is just a bunch of lies, eh?
8864 : But the Windurstians seem to be saying it with a straight face...?
8865 : Ahhh, I'm sooo full! I just ate ten servings! Hahaha... Are you impressed? Well, that there restaurant sells only Tarutaru-sized servings, and ten is quite an easy amount to stomach.
8866 : However, the owner was telling me that during the Crystal War, there were times when a lack of rations forced the restaurant to close its doors. Can you believe it?
8867 : In the war of twenty years ago, Windurst received a painful blow from the beastmen. Yet the constructions around here are rather new, leading one to assume these were built after the war.
8868 : Well now, my son and I came to view the ruins here, so we should be heading on over to Windurst Walls. They are east of here, are they not?
8869 : Why doesn't Windurst have high castle walls like San d'Oria? They should learn how to build proper towns from us San d'Orians!
8870 : You're now in Windurst Waters. If you like, I'll use my incredible magic abilities to send you over to Windurst Woods, far to the east of here.
8871 : Warp to Windurst Woods? Warp away! Maybe another day.
8872 : Oh, wow! When did you rrreceive official rrrecognition as an adventurrrerrr?
8873 : Why, only the otherrr day you werrre a novice adventurrrerrr like me. Imprrressive!
8874 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... What's that? You have a question you want to ask me, the man on the spot?
8875 : I'm the ace reporter for the Magic Paradise Weekly. Why, I don't even have to move a finger. All the news just comes to me. Munch-munch...chew-chew...
8876 : Welcome to the Evensong Restaurant...the jolliest way to end the day...
8877 : Take your time and enjoy some of our many delicious dishes.
8878 : Welcome to the Morning Star Restaurant...the perfect place to start your day.
8879 : Take a moment to relax and savor the quietude.
8880 : Welcome to the Bridge of Dreams Restaurant...the place where your culinary desires are fulfilled.
8881 : We have many healthy dishes for you to try.
8882 : Welcome to the Cerulean Stairs Restaurant...the cheapest and tastiest place in all Windurst.
8883 : Today we have fresh seafood by the boatload. Why not try our fish for lunch or dinner?
8884 : The cooking herrre is carrried overrr from the Culinarrrians' Guild, so that's why the taste is top class.
8885 : People come from farrr and abrrroad just to taste ourrr dishes. Arrren't you imprrressed?
8886 : I'm the house flutist. I do nightly performances at this restaurant.
8887 : Have you ever visited us here at nighty-nighty?
8888 : People are strange when it comes to food. It seems our tastes change with the time of day. I recommend you try our dinner dishes here too!
8889 : Please enjoy some soul-soothing music for a while.
8890 : I'm in charrrge of the daytime perrrforrrmances. Durrring the nights, I also enjoy listening in on Jatan-Paratan's flute perrrforrrmances.
8891 : By the way, I hope my daughterrr hasn't offended you. She's a little rrrowdy at times...
8892 : Enjoy yourrr stay herrre.
8893 : It took us twenty long years to restore our town, and just when we think we have it good, along come the rumors of war again...
8894 : Don't tell me we need to sacrifice the lives of so many mages...not to mention the innocent lives of our wee children...?
8895 : If it takes some tribute offerings to the Yagudo to avoid a full-blown war, then I'm happy to offer it to them.
8896 : This may be a little rude of me, but have you, my fair customer, ever listened to one of my performances?
8897 : I perform here during the nights. My job is to assist you in your enjoyment of our fine food and drinks with my dreamy-weamy melodies.
8898 : Please stop by the next evening you are free, and enjoy the rhythm of the night.
8899 : Have you, my fair customer, ever listened to one of my performances? If you don't mind giving your opinion, perhaps you could let me know your thoughts for my future reference.
8900 : How did you like his performance? It was like music to my ears. Face the music! It wasn't so good. I have no recollection at all.
8901 : So you think my playing still needs work?
8902 : I appreciate your honest opinion. I shall strive to continuously improve my skills.
8903 : Why, thank you so very much. I'll take that as encouragement to continuously improve my skills.
8904 : Please stop by and listen again some time.
8905 : As a simple musician that would be taken as biting criticism, but as a restaurant performer, it is the greatest of praises. Thank you very much.
8906 : I strive to create music that complements your meal and doesn't distract from your conversation. Please stop by and enjoy the atmosphere again some time.
8907 : My fair customer, what are your thoughts on our restaurant here?
8908 : I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked that. It's not like I'm the owner of the place or anything like that...
8909 : I just love the tastes and atmosphere of this restaurant. I shall never forget the bliss I encountered here in the middle of my long, hard travels.
8910 : After discovering this place, I simply forced the proprietor into allowing me to have a position here. Alas...but then...
8911 : ...... I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me... Please forget it.
8912 : ...... I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me... Please forget what I said.
8913 : Come to think of it, a little while back, a barrrd from Jeuno came herrre to stay forrr a spell.
8914 : My motherrr said that everrr since that barrrd arrrrived, Jatan-Paratan has been acting all strrrange.
8915 : That tenant was a Hume with the most amazing facial hair I've seen!
8916 : I worrrry about Jatan-Paratan lately. He only performs quiet numbers now...
8917 : Before, he used to play cheerful tunes that seemed to make us forrrget about the day's fatigue. I wonder what is troubling him?
8918 : Naturally, I also am most worried about Jatan-Paratan.
8919 : That bard who came from Jeuno the other day appears to be an old traveling companion of his. So I assume that when they got caught up on each other's tales, he suddenly got the urge to start wandering again...?
8920 : Ah? What's this...? Where in Vana'diel did you get this...?
8921 : Don't tell me you traveled all the way to Jeuno to meet Ruslan! Why would you do such a thing?
8922 : What? Yung and Yuli Yaam were worried that I'm not myself of late...
8923 : I am sincerely touched by the fact you all care so much about me...
8924 : Allow me to share my heartfelt feelings with you...
8925 : 'Twas a little while ago that Ruslan, an old acquaintance who practiced music with me, came to this very tavern and let me hear of his recent tales.
8926 : He praised my performance greatly, but had no interest in the food of this restaurant.
8927 : Despite sojourning here for several weeks and eating the food here every night, he couldn't remember the slightest thing about the restaurant's cooking.
8928 : 'Twas then that I realized that my flamboyant performance itself was detracting from the tastes and atmosphere of this tavern.
8929 : It was like I was repaying the tavern owner's kindness with evil...or biting the hand that feeds me--no, everyone...
8930 : And so now I'm searching within myself for a more appropriate sound. Alas, I've been unable to find it yet.
8931 : I apologize for the trouble I've caused...drawing you into my own personal problems...problems that shouldn't concern one as esteemed as yourself.
8932 : But, yes indeed, this was once the goal I sought after. I shall gladly accept it from you. However, let me pay you back with this...
8933 : That is also a little something I collected while I was first obsessed with music.
8934 : I was going to throw it away, but I suppose if one were to sell it, it would fetch quite a sum. Please take it. I hope it assists you in your travels.
8935 : I beg your pardon, but, if you don't mind...could we kindly keep this between you and me, and not bother Yung and Yuli Yaam with my problems?
8936 : I don't want to worry them any further with my problems. It might affect Yuli's philosophy towards music...
8937 : I just love Yuli Yaam's music.
8938 : Perhaps it is selfish of me, but when I first came here midway through my journeys, I wished both this place and its music would stay the same.
8939 : I don't know what is botherrring Jatan-Paratan, but I've decided to carrrry on as if nothing has changed.
8940 : I hope that my warrrm-hearrrted music will prrrovide him with morrre comforrrt and encourrragement than worrrds can...
8941 : I hope my harrrp can ease Jatan-Paratan's melancholy hearrrt, even a little.
8942 : Motherrr is such a worrrrierrr! Jatan-Paratan seems his same old self again to me.
8943 : But I must say that I did prrreferrr the cheerrrful little ditties Jatan-Paratan used to play beforrre. They werrre morrre my type of music.
8944 : Each and every one of us have their own problems. But such is the spice of life...
8945 : Welcome to the restaurant that resounds with its own sound! Welcome to the Timbre Timbers Tavern!
8946 : Welcome to my little catalyst shop, where you'll find a range of general and unusual goods!
8947 : For adventurerrrs on the go, Ensasa's Catalyst Shop is the place for all you need in generrral goods!
8948 : Erg! I'm sooo busy-wusy! I thought this job would be a great way to meetaru people, but they've got me out in the backy-wacky all day doing odd jobs!
8949 : Oh, hidey-widey! This is the Federal Magic Reservey-wervey. What can I do for you today-oway?
8950 : Welcome to the Federal Magic Reserve, the only place in the Federation where high-level magic is allowed to be sold.
8951 : Welcome to Baren-Moren's, makers of the finest headwear. Our slogan is: The smarter the hat, the smarter the head.
8952 : He-he-he... I've got stuff going cheap.
8953 : May I take your order, please...
8954 : Psst... Check out these things my suppliers in Aragoneu dug up.
8955 : Sorrrry, but I'm waiting on my next shipment from Aragoneu, so I'm all out of things to sell you at the moment.
8956 : Can I interest you in some of Sarutabaruta's wares? Come on, have a look, and see how I fares!
8957 : Sorry-dorry, but I'm taking a breaky-wakey! (Or, as you'll be knowing,  since control of Sarutabaruta was lost, I'm out of stock, so go on, get going!)
8958 : Psst... Wanna buy somethin' cheap from Kolshushu?
8959 : Hee-hee-hee... Can you hang on a while? I can start selling you good stuff from Kolshushu once I'm ready.
8960 : Hello, adventurer! Can I interest you in something a little different--something from Elshimo?
8961 : Well, um, let me see... This should be a good spot to open shop. There are some wealthy-looking Tarutaru houses nearby. It's quiet and yet there're plenty of passers-by...
8962 : He-he-he... Hey! How's about... Items from Li'Telor that you can't do without? Reckon you could do, with one of these or two?
8963 : Oh... Phew... My heart is so blue... Bluer than these flowers... Leave me be for a couple hours...
8964 : Greetings.  Can I interest you in some of these goods from Ronfaure...?
8965 : Greetings! I am Jourille, your friendly neighborhood traveling merchant. I would most like to sell you something from Ronfaure right now, but I regret that I am waiting on my next shipment. Please call by later!
8966 : Who the hell are you? Did you know that this residence belongs to the unspeakably rich Honoi-Gomoi--oh, that's me, you know!--before you so rudely barged in?
8967 : I'm rolling in money, but I haven't a single gil to give to the likes of you! Get out of here! Go on... Shoo, shoo!

9042 : Welcome to the Rarab Tail Hostelry, dearie. The warmest warren for rest and relaxation of all our rarab-like friends.
9043 : Windurst is a fun place best enjoyed by leaving all your little worries behind, and letting yourself go with the flow of nature's rythm.
9044 : Ouch... I was attacked by Yagudo the other day, and my wounds still haven't healed.
9045 : I intend to keep resting up here in Windurst until all my wounds have completely healed. In the meantime, I've left my house in Mhaura in the care of my younger brother.
9046 : We merchants have to travel in order to make any real money. Yet, as you well know, there are so many strong monsters out there in the wilderness.
9047 : Merchants have to be as strong as warriors in order to survive in this mauthe-doog-eat-mauthe-doog world!
9048 : Hello, dearie!  You're an adventurer, aren't you? Mind if old Chamama asks you for a little favor-wavor, luv?
9049 : You see, dearie, it's about our Rarab Tail Hostelry's souvenir dish, Rarab Tail Pickles. Do you know of them? They're famous throughout the whole Federation!
9050 : Anyway, to make our Rarab Tail Pickles, we place a whole lot of % into a barrel and weigh the lid down to slowly pickle them.
9051 : Now here's the problem, dearie--I dropped the stone we use to weigh the lid down with, and it shattered into pieces.
9052 : If possible, I'd like an adventurer, such as yourself, to find me another stone that I could use to weigh the pickle barrel's lid down. A smooth, round, heavy stone...
9053 : Help Chamama out of her pickle? Yes. Leave no stone unturned. No. Stonewall her.
9054 : Well, I guess you're a busy person. Don't worry, dearie, I'll ask someone else to help me out. I'll just pay them the reward instead...
9055 : Thank you for offering to help me, dearie. Bring me any smooth, round stones you happen to find, and I'll see if any fit the job.
9056 : The perfect stone has to be just the right weight. Not too heavy and not too light. It might take us several tries to find the right one, but we'll just have to keep at it until we do.
9057 : If you bear with me until we find just the right stone, then I'll give you a fitting little present.
9058 : I can't pickle my % properly unless I have the proper weighing stone to press the barrel's lid down.
9059 : Bring me any smooth, round stones you happen to find, and I'll see if any fit the job. We'll just have to keep on trying, dearie, until we find just the right one.
9060 : Sorry to be such a nuisance, dearie, but could you please try and find me just the right stone for pickling with?
9061 : I know it seems overly fussy, but please understand. These pickles bear the name of my hostelry on them. Their quality affects our store's image.
9062 : Hmm... Um... Hmm... It needs to be a tad heavier...
9063 : It's no good, dearie. We'll just have to find another one!
9064 : Hmm... Um... Hmm... It needs to be a teensy-weensy bit bigger...
9065 : It's no good, dearie. We'll just have to try another!
9066 : Ah! Now this is more like it. Just the right size... Just the right weight...
9067 : Thank you very much, dearie. You did well, finding such a perfect pickle stone. I'm sure this will ensure the perfection of our prized pickles!
9068 : Here, this is your reward, dearie. It's something I wore back in the old days when I was a traveling performer. Please use it well.
9069 : Just the right size... Just the right weight... Oh, and so smooth and round, too.
9070 : I'm sure this will make my pickles just perfect. Our customers should be just delighted, dearie.
9071 : Oh dearie, you won't believe this, but I went and did it again. Do you mind helping out old Chamama again?
9072 : Once again, I accidentally dropped the smooth stone you found for my pickle barrel... And it broke into pieces.
9073 : Would you be so good as to find me another smooth, round stone there, dearie?
9074 : Here... Please take this as a reward. Use it well, dearie.
9075 : Work harder! Work harder!
9076 : The Tarutaru Times Company can never rest! We can't afford to miss the publication deadline of our Magic Paradise Weekly! It's the only source of reliable news in Windurst. So work harder!
9077 : Our editor is all fired up...more so than usual.
9078 : All our staff are tired and worn out from our last special report, What Happened to the Star Reading Ceremony?. He's just wasting his breath and annoying us all.
9079 : I'm the editor of the only source of reliable news in Windurst, the Tarutaru Times Company's Magic Paradise Weekly!
9080 : Hmm... What should I do for our next feature? I need a snappy exclusive to hook the customers!
9081 : Your average news item just doesn't cut it with the intelligentsia who live around Windurst.
9082 : Come to think of it, those reporters we dispatched to each of the different districts of Windurst haven't reported in at all. It's way past their deadline...!
9083 : Hey, you there...kid! Have you seen any of my reporters around town? If you happen to see them, make yourself useful and tell them to hand in their news articles!
9084 : The reporters we dispatched to each of the different districts of Windurst haven't reported in at all. It's way past their deadline, too!
9085 : If you happen to see them, kid, make yourself useful and tell them to hand in their news articles!
9086 : There should be a reporter in each of the four districts of Windurst.
9087 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... What's that? You have a question you want to ask me, the man on the spot?
9088 : ...? Naiko-Paneiko? <choke>-<gasp>-<burp>!
9089 : Don't ever mention my editor's name while I'm enjoying my steak! I have a beef with him!
9090 : I'm busy eating here. If you can handle it, I'll give you my scoop. So bowl outta here or we'll both be in the soup!
9091 : Don't cheese me off by mentioning my editor's name while I'm enjoying fondue!
9092 : I've forked over my scoop to you, so take it back to him. Come on... Chop chop! Act like a whisk and beat it!
9093 : Well done, kid. Seems like you got the lot here...
9094 : Humph?
9095 : Hmm...
9096 : A-huh.....?
9097 : ..............................
9098 : ......................This could be it!
9099 : Hey, kid! Did you confirm the veracity of Umumu's article properly before submitting it to me?
9100 : If her information is correct, then this could be the exclusive scoop we've been looking for!
9101 : This year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism will go to our article on Where the Cat Burglar Hides her Kitty!
9102 : Well done. Nicely scooped, kid! I'll make Umumu's article the exclusive feature of our next issue.
9103 : This year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism will go to our article on Where the Cat Burglar Hides her Kitty!
9104 : Well, we better get busy and put this into production. Here's your reward, kid. Now scram!
9105 : Hurry up and get this article into production! Move it! Move it!
9106 : Heh. Looks like we scooped quite a story here.
9107 : We've all got to get cracking now! We've got to get this baby into production!
9108 : Hey, kid! Did you confirm the veracity of Umumu's article before submitting it to me? Did you check whether the Cat Burglar's hideout is under the Horutoto Ruins or not?
9109 : What the...? The first rule of journalism is to always check your sources, kid. We ain't no amateur tabloid here!
9110 : No matter how great and sensational the story is, it's totally useless if it turns out to be a bunch of lies.
9111 : A good reporter needs a good nose for uncovering the story, then good legs to go check [his/her] sources. Learn that and you'll go far.
9112 : St-st-stolen! Our proof copy has been stolen!
9113 : The proof copy of our next Magic Paradise Weekly with the exclusive report on the Cat Burglar's hideout is gone!
9114 : Someone st-st-stole it! Aaawwrrghhh!
9115 : There's only one person who could have done this... None other than the Cat Burglar herself! We've got to get it back, kid!  Go! Get moving!
9116 : There's only one person who could have stolen it...the Cat Burglar herself! We've got to get the proof copy back, kid!  Go! Get moving!
9117 : What's that dirty little box you have there, kid? The Magic Paradise Weekly editing room has no need for that, do we, now?
9118 : The Cat Burglar must have smelt a rat... Nanaa Mihgo didn't want us to expose her hideaway, so she stole the story before it could go into circulation. Agh...someone really let the cat outta the bag!
9119 : Aaah! This week's edition of the Magic Paradise Weekly is going to be canceled as well. It happens so often, though, that nobody's going to notice anyway...<Sigh>
9120 : What's that, you say? The stolen proof copy of next week's Magic Paradise Weekly is in this box?
9121 : Let me see... Hmm... Let me see...
9122 : You're rightaru! This really is the stolen proof copy of our Magic Paradise Weekly!
9123 : Now that we have this magic doll back, everything's all right! This talking doll has recorded all our reporters' articles and interviews with important people. Everything we need to go to production is in here.
9124 : Here we go...! Switch on!
9125 : THE...KEY...IS...IN...THE...CAR-DI-AN'S...STOM-ACH...
9126 : Wha-wha-wha-wha-what!?
9127 : THE...KEY...IS...IN...THE...CAR-DI-AN'S...STOM-ACH...
9128 : Damn that cursed Cat Burglar!!! She recorded over our data by making the doll memorize a new message!
9129 : Waaah! This means we've lost the entire contents of our next Magic Paradise Weekly! <Sniff>... Boo-hoo-hoo!!!
9130 : I guess it just goes to prove the old saying... If you can't say anything nice about someone, then don't say it atarull!
9131 : You there, kid! Bravo on getting our magic doll back from the paws of that thieving Cat Burglar!
9132 : Let me show my appreciation for your work there, kid... Thanks!
9133 : What!? You thought our Magic Paradise Weekly was a newspaper or a book or something?
9134 : Don't assume we're behind the Times, kid. Magic Paradise Weekly is at the forefront of modern technology.
9135 : The Cat Burglar must have caught wind of us... Nanaa Mihgo didn't want us to expose her hideaway, so she stole the story before it could go into circulation.
9136 : But you did real well to get the magic doll back off of her! It's practically impossible to retrieve anything stolen by the Cat Burglar!
9137 : Did you check? Yes. No.
9138 : Oh, excuse me, but...the % you got me dried up and died while I was contemplating how I should hand it to her...
9139 : Sorry to put you out again, but could you go to the Rhinostery and get me another?
9140 : FiVE'sGRe-EtinG? OF COu-RSeiTIsheL-Lo!
9141 : You show off the %.
9142 : The advertising effect of the % wears off.
9143 : You show off the %.
9144 : Blast... It's past # at last. I'm bereft there's less than # [hour/hours] left. Your time's as good as up I see, so return the magic doll to me.

9191 : I'll bring you a nice present from the moogles' hometown, kupo! I'll be back in a few days, kupo!
9192 : Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
9193 : Here's your present--the behemoth of Mog Safes, kupo! Now you can store as many as 70 items, kupo!
9194 : The capacity of your Mog Safe has increased!
9195 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
9196 : After resting on the %, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?
9197 : Give your moogle some time off? Have fun, kupo! No, I am your only friend now!
9198 : Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!
9199 : The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take % for my friends there, kupo!
9200 : And my other buddies need % for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!
9201 : I can't help out my friends if I don't have % and %, kupo...
9202 : I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!
9203 : Master! I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!
9204 : We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!
9205 : %? Hmm... Sorry, but I never heard that name before.
9206 : Try doing some missions for Windurst. Bust you britches, and everybody'll know who you are.
9207 : That's when the real work starts rolling in. People won't trust you unless you give them something to trust.
9208 : %? Hmm... Now, was that the name of the...? No, that was some other [guy/lady].
9209 : Either way, you're still not making much of a name of yourself here yet. Hard work and perseverence--that's what's going to put you on the map.
9210 : Oh, you're the % that people are starting to talk about. I've heard pretty good things about you.
9211 : Hard work and perseverence--those are the only things that'll put you on the map.
9212 : Why, if it isn't %! I heard some guys talking about you over their dinners at the eatery last night.
9213 : They had nothing but good things to say about you. Keep up the good work!
9214 : Hello there, %! There aren't many Windurstians who don't know that name.
9215 : We're all proud to have you on our side! Keep up the great work!
9216 : [Mister/Miss] %! You'd have to be living in a hole somewhere not to have heard that name.
9217 : All the bards in the land are singing songs of your outstanding deeds. Keep up the extraordinary work!
9218 : [Mister/Miss] %! There isn't a soul in all of Windurst that has yet to hear the tales of your feats.
9219 : Why, I remember when you were just a fledgling adventurer. It seems like just yesterday...
9220 : [Lord/Lady] %! I am honored to have the hero of Windurst in my presence.
9221 : Every man and woman in the country knows by heart the tales of your courage. May the Goddess shine her light of grace upon you.
9222 : I am a friar of the San d'Oria Cathedral, come to Windurst as part of a pilgrimage.
9223 : Now that my devotions at the Crag of Mea in the Tahrongi Canyon are complete, I have orders from the cathedral to research the union between the magical arts of Windurst and miracles born of faith.
9224 : I debated on how to best proceed, but finally settled on the field of putting troubled spirits to rest.
9225 : After hours of painstaking research, I was able to create an item that could be said to stand at the pinnacle of white magic!
9226 : Behold my creation! Please take this % and journey to the Eldieme Necropolis, a veritable city of restless souls.
9227 : In the Necropolis, you will find a brazier with a flame that wavers from time to time. If you hold this % aloft in that place, it should bring the spirits into a state of tranquility. Please return and inform me of the outcome.
9228 : Why not go there myself, you ask? I am on a pilgrimage, and must not travel north of Jeuno.
9229 : Furthermore, I am but a simple scholar. It would be impossible for me to enter a place such as the Eldieme Necropolis.
9230 : Please give peace to the spirits of the Eldieme Necropolis.
9231 : Ah, you're back! And the result? Oh, I see...I was so sure it would work...
9232 : In any case, I must thank you for your assistance. I would like to reward you immediately, but I do not possess anything of value...
9233 : Please take this letter of introduction to Eperdur of the San d'Oria Cathedral.
9234 : May Paradise open its gates to you.
9235 : Please take this letter of introduction to Eperdur of the San d'Oria Cathedral.
9236 : A communication from the cathedral arrived to encourage me in my ongoing research.
9237 : The Gates of Paradise are yet distant, I fear.
9238 : What's that smell, dude? My eyes are all itchy and my nose is all twitchy...
9239 : ...but...<yawn!>
9240 : I'm...still...pretty...slee...py... ZZZzzz...
9241 : Well gee, I'll be! That's just swell... Usually a sniff of % cures any Sleep spell. I wonder what's wrong with Paku-Nakku? Ah, hell!
9242 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
9243 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
9244 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
9245 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
9246 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
9247 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
9248 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
9249 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
9250 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
9251 : You've earned conquest points!
9252 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
9253 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
9254 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
9255 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
9256 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
9257 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
9258 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
9259 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
9260 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
9261 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
9262 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
9263 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
9264 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
9265 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
9266 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
9267 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
9268 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
9269 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
9270 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
9271 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
9272 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
9273 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
9274 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
9275 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
9276 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
9277 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
9278 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
9279 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
9280 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
9281 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
9282 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
9283 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
9284 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
9285 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
9286 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
9287 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
9288 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.

9290 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
9291 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
9292 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
9293 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
9294 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
9295 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.
9296 : Good work, citizen. We've awarded you rank points for the crystals you've donated.
9297 : You currently have # conquest points. Would you like to use them to purchase items?
9298 : Which item do you wish to purchase?

9300 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
9301 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.
9302 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 50 conquest points.
9303 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 100 conquest points.
9304 : It is possible to fully recharge % by trading it to one of your nation's guards, including outpost guards. One charge requires 200 conquest points.
9305 : During the time of the Great War, it was possible to have this item recharged in exchange for Allied Notes. From my understanding, that practice has recently become commonplace in the Near East. Though you'll be needing Imperial Standing credits if you wish to use the service there.
9306 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.
9307 : Please be aware that you can only purchase or recharge % once during the period between each conquest results tally.

9324 : Do you really wish to be teleported? Yes. Teleport with gil. Teleport with conquest points. No.
9325 : Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
9326 : It should please you to know that I now also deal in %. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!
9327 : I see that your home country has control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
9328 : I see that your home country is allies with the country in control of this region. Feel free to browse through my wares.
9329 : I can teleport you to your home country for # gil or # conquest [point/points].
9330 : Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered.  Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
9331 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
9332 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
9333 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
9334 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
9335 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.
9336 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points moderately. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.

9346 : You do not have enough gil to set your home point here.
9347 : I will set your home point here.
9348 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
9349 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
9350 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
9351 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
9352 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
9353 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.
9354 : Requirements for participating in an E.F. are simple. Your party must consist of # members. Each member must be from this country, rank 3 or higher, and have reached a sufficient level.
9355 : Once your party is ready, come to me and I will teleport you to the nearest outpost.
9356 : There, you will receive an insignia of the Expeditionary Force. When you succeed in taking control of the area, you can exchange the insignia for your reward.
9357 : Join the E.F. in [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Join the E.F. Not this time.
9358 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
9359 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
9360 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
9361 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
9362 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
9363 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
9364 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...

9366 : Quit the E.F.? Yes. Change locations. No.
9367 : Are you sure?
9368 : Really quit the E.F.? Yes. No.
9369 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
9370 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
9371 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
9372 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
9373 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
9374 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
9375 : You received # conquest points!
9376 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
9377 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
9378 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
9379 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
9380 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
9381 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
9382 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
9383 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
9384 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
9385 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
9386 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
9387 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
9388 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
9389 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
9390 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
9391 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
9392 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
9582 : PAUSE
9584 : Phooey, Dewey! I'm sooo confused. This goes over...no, that goes...no, this needs to be...no...
9585 : What? No... Here from Bastok, are we? Yes? How may I help? No...assist, yes, assist.
9586 : Really? No... You say you're looking for %? Yes...yes, I remember that one, I do.
9587 : It turned up the last time, or was it the first...no...the last time I cleaned out the old book vault. That text was filled with lots of important-looking blacksmithing techniques.
9588 : One look, and I knew this book didn't belong here in Windurst, I mean...not here in this library...I mean.
9589 : So, I decided to take it to Bastok and see if I could shed any light on the mystery surrounding the text...and that's when I was attacked by a band of rogues...Yagudo rogues, they were.
9590 : If we ever want to see it again, we'll have to travel to Giddeus and get it back from that thief, Vaa Huja the Erudite, ourselves.
9591 : Well, I didn't exactly mean ourselves. You're the adventurer, aren't you...yes?
9592 : That thief, Vaa Huja the Erudite, is probably using % to line his birdcage as we speak!
9593 : We must do something...yes, something quickly!
9594 : Well, I'm happy to see that we were successful in retrieving %... Yes, very happy.
9595 : Oh, yes, and when you take that back to Bastok, could you ask them if there are any other books they can donate? If they don't have any, a generous donation of gil would work just as well.
9596 : If you pursue the procurement of additional % and %, please proceed here posthaste!
9597 : Our prompt payment will be a pleasant perk!
9598 : Perchance, if you pursue the procurement of additional % and %, please proceed here posthaste!
9599 : Our prompt payment will be a pleasant perk!
9600 : I just can't understand what those people from the Tenshodo are thinking! Who would want to buy something that rots their teeth? You wouldn't...would you?
9601 : I just can't understand what those people from the Tenshodo are thinking! Who would want to buy something that blows up? You wouldn't...would you?
9602 : A day doesn't go by when I fail to hear a tale of your deeds.
9603 : I am proud to be a citizen of the same great country as [Sir/Lady] %. Keep up the marvelous work!
9604 : The door is firmly shut...
9605 : I wonder what is to become of Windurst? Is there anything that a simple-wimple guard like me can do...?
9606 : For now, I just practice my swordplay with Ten of Hearts every day. He doesn't get tired, so he makes a good training partner.
9607 : At times like these, you've gotta be cool, calm, and... Um...
9608 : We guards are Windurst's last line of defense. No mattaru what happens, I must keep Miss Apururu safe from harm.
9609 : PeOPleaRe VeRYuNPrEdICt-aBLe.  ItiS hARdfOr TEnto GUeSsThEIr NeXtMOve.

9611 : %, have you ever met with Minister Ajido-Marujido? He has issued orders for you to proceed to the Orastery with all due haste.
9612 : It's surprising that he asked for you personally, but even more unusual is the fact that the minister issued a mission in the first place.
9613 : I hear that he hates this kind of bother-wothersome procedure... Whatever it is, it must be importantaru.
9614 : This is a mission from Minister Ajido-Marujido. Please hurry to the Orastery.
9615 : You should really get to the Orastery while the minister is still in Windurst. He tends to disappear without so much as a ta-taru.
9616 : How goes the adventuring life? Your new mission is from the Orastery, rightaru?
9617 : Minister Ajido-Marujido is the most super spell-slinger in Windurst. Or maybe that would be Doctor Shantotto?
9618 : I wonder who would win in a duel of dweomers? It would be a close match, don't you think?
9619 : There's a well-known story from the time when Minister Ajido-Marujido was in magic school.
9620 : The minister got stompily-womped in the monster-hunting exam on Buburimu Peninsula when he tried to beat the record held by Karaha-Baruha. He really-weally hates to lose.
9621 : AJiDO-MaRUjIdo..? TEnknOWs hImWeLL.
9622 : HeiS MoTHerApUrUrU's bRoTHer. WhiCHmAkES hIMtEn's uNCle...
9623 : ...TeNreMeMbeRS bEInGhIt WiTh A wAnDWHen tEnSAiD ThAT.
9624 : Looks like Ajido-Marujido has finally been restrained by the Sibyl Guards!
9625 : Has his search for power blinded his judgmentaru? How dare he set foot in the Full Moon Fountain, sacred-wacred place of our beloved Star Sibyl!
9626 : Have you heard? Minister Ajido-Marujido has finally incurred the wrath of the Star Sibyl and was thrown into the Dark Dungeon-wungeon!
9627 : It's a frightening place. Lawbreakers sent to the Dark Dungeon are said to go loopy-woopy from fear.
9628 : ...But enough about that. The Star Sibyl has sent a summons for you to appear at Heavens Tower.
9629 : This is probably none of my business-wusiness, but your previous mission was issued by Minister Ajido-Marujido, wasn't it?
9630 : ......? Could that mean that you too will be...?
9631 : Minister Ajido-Marujido's imprisonment has been kept a secret-wecret from the general public. If this news were to reach the ears of a foreign spy or a beastman, there are those who would take advantage of the situation to stage a coup.
9632 : ...But enough of my idle-widle speculations. The Star Sibyl awaits your presence at Heavens Tower.
9633 : The mages of the Orastery must all be in a flurry-scurry. The imprisonment of a minister is unprecedented.
9634 : What can be done to soothe the fury-wury of the Star Sibyl? No matter how much I ponder-wonder, I justaru can't think of anything!
9635 : The Star Sibyl awaits you at Heavens Tower. It appears to be a very gravy-wave matter.
9636 : If you're thinking of running off to another country, now's the time to do it. I should tell you, though, the guards will definitaruly come after you. I'm sorry you gotaru mixed up in all this.
9637 : ThESmaLL cHAmbErSuNdER tHeCenTraL tOwEriN SaRuTaBaRuTaaLL hAvenAMes cOr-rEspONd-iNgtO oNeoF tHeeLeMeNtS.

9639 : It was pretty tensey-wense for a while there, but thank the Goddess the Star Sibyl has forgiven you.
9640 : And now you have another mission-wission from the Optistery. Something about giving a hand with the ministry's spring cleaning...
9641 : Why would they ask a rank seven adventurer to help with something like that? They must want you to handle some spooky-wooky tomes or gruesome grimoires.
9642 : Your mission from the Optistery is a request to help with the ministry's spring cleaning...
9643 : Why would they ask a rank seven adventurer to help with something like that? They must want you to handle some troublesome tomes or gruesome grimoires.
9644 : Did you think things would get easier as your rank got higher?
9645 : Heh-heh-heh, you've got it all topsy-turvy. There aren'taru too many high-ranked adventurers, so you get to do all the really difficultaru missions!
9646 : Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery was never very buddy-wuddy with Minister Ajido-Marujido.
9647 : So when the Minister of the Orastery was captured, Minister Tosuka-Porika was pleased as punchy-wunch. He's that sortaru of guy.
9648 : TeNoFTeN sEEsMotHEr ApUrUrUruNNiNg tOaNd fRO.
9649 : SHewAS leAViNgtHe OptISterYeARLieR. TeNwONdeRs wHaTiS hAp-pENiNg.
9650 : Hrm. Hrmmm... Hrrrmmmmmm...hrm!
9651 : ...Hrm!? Aren'taru you the adventurer who completed my last mission?
9652 : Heh-heh-heh... Actually, the mission I issued to the gatehouse was justaru a cover-up.
9653 : Since the incidentaru with Ajido-Marujido, the Sibyl Guards have been paying too much attention to the mission statements...
9654 : ...Rightaru, down to business. Do you remember the mission I issued last time?
9655 : The Book of the Gods... We had no idea of its location for all those years after the war. That was the tome you recovered for us from the dastard-wastardly Cat Burglar.
9656 : Ajido-Marujido then swiped the book, and delivered it to the Star Sibyl himself.
9657 : Then a few days ago... The Star Sibyl summoned me to Heavens Tower and handed the Book of the Gods over to me.
9658 : I was ordered to never letaru that tome see the light of day again.
9659 : ...Hrmmm... That's what the Star Sibyl ordered, so I mustaru obey! But I...that is something I just cannot do!
9660 : The pages of the Book of the Gods are blank! I cannot turn my eyes from the truth. As the name of the Optistery suggestarus, we are the eyes of Windurst!
9661 : If I ignore the truth before me, how can I call myself the Minister of the Optistery?
9662 : Here is the deal. What I am aboutaru to tell you must be in the strictest-wictest of confidence. You mustn'taru leak a word of it to anyone.
9663 : When I was still justaru a student, I heard about the Book of the Gods from the minister at the time...Minister Karaha-Baruha.
9664 : The Book of the Gods refers to the True History written by the first Star Sibyl for the benefitaru of the Star Sibyls that would succeed her.
9665 : The truth contained in this book can be extremely-wemely dangerous, and it has been passed down through generations of Ministers.
9666 : Consequentaruly, the Book of the Gods is sealed by powerful spells. This seal can only be broken through the expenditure of huge amountarus of magic while employing the Diza Star that hangs from the neck of the Star Sibyl.
9667 : ...I don'taru know how he did it, but Minister Karaha-Baruha managed to obtain the Star Sibyl's permission to open the Book of the Gods.
9668 : To breach the seal on the tome, the minister utilized the power of the Horutoto Ruins' magical towers...
9669 : ...And from the Book of the Gods, he learned a certain truth. This truth was indeed a dangerous thing.
9670 : Karaha-Baruha carried outaru his research in a laboratory hidden within Toraimarai Canal...
9671 : You mightaru call this laboratory the sixth ministry of Windurst. ...The Animastery...
9672 : Adventurer, find that ministry. If you enter the Animastery, you may find something from Minister Karaha-Baruha's research.
9673 : We mustaru discover the reason why the writings contained in this tome have vanished.
9674 : Ah yes, I mustaru give you this. You should be able to enter the Animastery using this ring. It is the %. Try your bestaru not to lose it.
9675 : Go to Toraimarai Canal and find the Animastery. There you may find the remnantarus of Minister Karaha-Baruha's research.
9676 : ...Hrmmm! Ah yes, don't go losing that %! I'm trusting you to take good care of it!
9677 : How's the mission going? You know, the cleaning of the book vault?
9678 : Up until now, we've been giving up our holidays to keep things clean and tidy around here. But it looks like Minister Tosuka-Porika has finally agreed to get an adventurer to help us.
9679 : There can't be a soul in Windurst who doesn't know the name of former Optistery Minister Karaha-Baruha.
9680 : He was a great genius who gave his life to save Windurst... The greatest Minister of the Optistery.
9681 : This is just between you and me, but there's a rumor that the great genius Karaha-Baruha only became the Minister of the Optistery so he could read the Book of the Gods.
9682 : It's definitaruly unusual that a mage of his caliber wouldn't become head of the Orastery instead.
9683 : ...Phewaaah...? Huh? You found an old %?
9684 : ...That looks like the ring that belonged to our previous minister, Karaha-Baruha. It was lost during the trouble-woubles of the Great War. But somebody was wearing it, rightaru?
9685 : ...Huaaah...? We're in the middle of cleaning out the book vault, so no borrowing today. Terribly sorry.
9686 : What's going on? The minister seems to be troubled. But the dimwit at the counter is half asleep as usual.
9687 : Hey, I wonder if they have any books written by one of the line of great geniuses?
9688 : I should ask the minister about it someday.
9689 : Hrm!? Oh, you finally made it back.
9690 : How did it go!? Did you find anything!?
9691 : Wh-wh-wh-wh-what!!! The Star Sibyl was there!?
9692 : Oh, my goodly Goddess... Charges could be brought against me... If they throw me in the Dark Dungeon, all is lostaru!
9693 : Hrm, adventurer! My life is in your hands. Take this and keep it safe.
9694 : I-i-if I am imprisoned in the Dark Dungeon, take it to the Star Sibyl and use it to secure my freedom.
9695 : Hrmmm! This is not blackmail. ...This is negotiation! Yes, you will negotiate my freedom with the Star Sibyl!
9696 : Don't breathey-weathe a word of this to anyone! Now quickly, get yourself away from here!
9697 : I-i-if I am imprisoned in the Dark Dungeon, take it to the Star Sibyl and use it to secure my freedom.
9698 : Hrmmm! This is not blackmail. ...This is negotiation! Yes, you will negotiate my freedom with the Star Sibyl!
9699 : For some reason, the words Book vault cleaning have been written in hugey-wuge letters on our schedule board.
9700 : There must be some mistake. You've already cleaned out our book vault, rightaru?
9701 : The sixth ministry of Windurst? Of course, everyone's heard the rumors. But they're justaru rumors...
9702 : What!? There really was a sixth ministry!? That's abolutely-wutely astonishing! Who was the minister, I wonder?
9703 : Why is Minister Tosuka-Porika so crimsony-red in the face?
9704 : Oh, I think I know. You messed up the book vault when you cleaned, didn't you?
9705 : A mission has been issued by the Rhinostery. They must have been in a hurry-wurry, as there's not much written here.
9706 : Please talk to Leepe-Hoppe on the second floor of the Rhinostery for the details.
9707 : A little while ago, I happened to see Minister Rukususu of the Rhinostery go past.
9708 : I wonder if her homecoming means she made some important-wortant discovery? I'd really like to know what this mission-wission is all about.
9709 : Most people think that the Rhinostery justaru researches plants, but actually, their research encompasses all living things.
9710 : Biology researchers wander all over Vana'diel. The mostaru capable adventurers of the Rhinostery always accompany these researchers on their treks into dangerous territory.
9711 : Minister Rukususu is so dreamy-weamy. If she stays Minister of the Rhinostery, the number of members will go through the roof.
9712 : Hm? How is she dreamy-weamy? How can you not know? It's that fragrance. I'm so head over heels, I can't think straight anymore.
9713 : WhYdOn't tHERhiNoSTeRy Re-sEaRchERstAKe CaRdiANsLiKE TeNwiTH tHEmoN tHEiRtRekS?
9714 : TeNtHiNKs tHAtwE CaRdiANswOuLd cOMeiN VeRyuSefUL...
9715 : You've come! You're here! No more to fear!
9716 : I want you to stop Minister Rukususu! She's run off on the trail of Mr. Iru-Kuiru,  All the way to the southern continent. It's terribly dangerous, in any event!
9717 : Ask Kerutoto for greater detail. She's on the first floor, with the whole sorry tale.
9718 : I want you to stop Minister Rukususu! She's run off on the trail of Mr. Iru-Kuiru,  All the way to the southern continent. It's terribly dangerous, in any event!
9719 : Ask Kerutoto for greater detail. She's on the first floor, with the whole sorry tale.
9720 : Have you talked with Leepe-Hoppe on the second floor?
9721 : Please go talk with him firstaru. If he doesn't know someone has accepted the mission, he won't be able think straight for worry.
9722 : The truth of it is, Minister Rukususu made an importantaru discovery in Fei'Yin and brought back an item with her.
9723 : I can'taru explain what that item was exactly, but it gave me the heeber-jeebers.
9724 : When I meditated on it, I sensed something unusual.
9725 : Do you know of Iru-Kuiru? He was a member of the Multinational Expedition that traveled to the Northlands thirty years ago, and was originally a biology researcher for the Rhinostery...
9726 : ...I could feel his spirit. He seemed to be somewhere on the southern continent...
9727 : ...When I told this to Minister Rukususu, she immediately took off in a terrible scurry-hurry.
9728 : What is it between those two? It was definitely not the reaction I was expecting.
9729 : The item that Minister Rukususu found appears to be suffused with Iru-Kuiru's memories of his visit to the Northlands.
9730 : Hmm? How do I know that? Because I'm one of the besty-west researchers at the Rhinostery, that's why.
9731 : Go to the southern continent right away, And rescue Rukususu from her path gone astray!
9732 : Iru-Kuiru was cursed unto death! It's been thirty years since his last living breath! Our beloved minister could end up sharing his fate, So be on your way, before it's too late!
9733 : ...Please...save...Minister...Rukususu...
9734 : ...<sob>...<sniff>...
9735 : When the chance to join the Multinational Expedition came to the Rhinostery, no one was particularly eager to sign up. The Northlands is a dreadful-wedful place.
9736 : Only Iru-Kuiru had the courage to put his hand up and volunteer. I wish that I could be as brave as Iru-Kuiru.
9737 : You're back! Is the minister safe and sound? Justaru a moment, I don't see her around!?
9738 : ...Don't tell me you returned and left her behind! Explain yourself, adventurer, have you lost your mind!?
9739 : Leepe-Hoppe, whatever is zee matter?
9740 : What are you shouting about? If it's moi you are looking for, I'm right here.
9741 : Minister Rukususu! It's so good to see you!
9742 : It seems my Rhinosterie peers have been quite worried pour moi.
9743 : Of course we are always going to worry, Whenever you take off in such a big hurry!
9744 : %, thank you for all you have done. I have one lastaru favor to ask vous...
9745 : Please keep what you saw in zat place just between vous and moi. Now is not zee time to be explaining zat particular truth to everyone.
9746 : Zee matter you heard about at zee Temple of Uggalepih is far too upsetting for us Tarutaru to cope with...
9747 : I'm so relieved to have the minister home. But she'll soon be off for another Northlands roam...
9748 : The other researchers are still up there on the ice. On Beaucedine Glacier, you can freeze in a trice!
9749 : ...<Mumble, mumble, mumble>...
9750 : ...%... Opens the Priming Gate... <snore>
9751 : ...Thank you...for...saving...the minister...
9752 : ...<grin>...
9753 : Was Iru-Kuiru living somewhere on the southern continent?
9754 : ...... Oh, so the curse did kill him. I guess that's why the minister went back to the Northlands. Even your memories become frozen up there...
9755 : Congratulations on reaching rank eight. You're steadily racking up the missions, huh? The other adventurers mustaru be in absolute awe when you walk past.
9756 : Your nextaru mission is one from the Aurastery. Please get the details from the instructors at the School of Magic.
9757 : This mission from the Aurastery is totally tip-top secret. I can't imagine what it could be...
9758 : ...Nope, drawing a completaru blank. The Aurastery is supposed to be the most peaceful of the five ministries, though, so how bad could it be?
9759 : The principal of the School of Magic is a very pleasant, although eccentric, character.
9760 : When we were kids--just normal students at the school, the principal would come and join in our Tarutaru games.
9761 : Have you met Professor Koru-Moru? He's the very, um, unique professor in Windurst Walls.
9762 : He once retired as the principal of the School of Magic, but due to an incidentaru a couple of years ago, he was reinstated.
9763 : PeoPLeaRE frEEtO ChOOsewHEthER oRnOt tHEyaTTeNd tHESchoOL oF MaGIc.
9764 : HoWEveR,wHEthER eNteRInGtHE SchoOL oF MaGIcLeADs tO a hIGh pOsItIoNiN sOCieTydEpEnDS oNtHE TeACheRs'eVaLu-aTIonS.
9765 : Sorry to keep you waiting. I guess you must be the gallant who got our mission at the gatehouse.
9766 : Are you acquainted with the amazing academic who administers our School of Magic?
9767 : Acquainted with the amazing academic? Absolutely! Actually, no.
9768 : [Ah, so you've met/I'm sure you've met] Professor Koru-Moru. As you are assuredly aware, Professor Koru-Moru rarely roams from his residence in Windurst Walls... He barely bothers with the barest bones of his principal business...
9769 : Four years ago, he took a rest from his responsible role. During that time, the person who took his tenure had the title of Sedal-Godjal.
9770 : With his dynamic endurance and diligent deductions, Sedal-Godjal was a marvelous nominee for Minister of the Aurastery.
9771 : However, for some reason, he eloped and left us in the lurch. We put Professor Koru-Moru back in the position of principal, and now you perceive our present predicament.
9772 : For three long years our lecturers have lived with the lack of a leader and luckily allayed any alarming eventualities. But if we continue to conduct our school on this course, I am concerned it will conflict with the cultivation of our students.
9773 : This is where you come in. I supplicate you to search the span of Vana'diel, and bring back Sedal-Godjal.
9774 : Our elusive educator was equipped with %. This Star Seeker should come in handy.
9775 : Professor Koru-Moru called for the construction of this Star Seeker in case the location of the principal's ring became obfuscated. It can sniff out the power of the stars and the moon infused in the ring.
9776 : When the professor was young and careless, he used it to search for the ring whenever he misplaced it.
9777 : The Star Seeker will suddenly start speaking, so be sure not to let its spiel slip by you.
9778 : Stand by. Power on!
9779 : Ahahahahaha! Let's go, slacker! Start heading north!
9780 : Use the magic doll you have been given to follow the magical emanations of the principal's ring and track down our wayward Mr. Sedal-Godjal.
9781 : Don't forget the Star Seeker will suddenly start speaking, so be sure not to let its spiel slip by you.
9782 : I wonder to where our former principal Sedal-Godjal disappeared?  If he showed up in the morning, now wouldn't that be weird?
9783 : I wonder why he ran away? Couldn't he take the day-to-day?
9784 : When our new principal disappearingly disappeared it didn't come as much of a shock, but without anyone to replacingly replace him, the Aurastery was in quite a fix.
9785 : ...What's that? Me? Oh no, no, no, far too troublingly troublesome.
9786 : The Manustery is currently mass-producing Cardians, but they used to manufacture magic dolls.
9787 : Relatively few people can master the techniques required to make them. I wonder why Professor Koru-Moru never took a position at the Manustery!
9788 : I'm having twouble-wouble with my study-wudies, so I came from the beginners class to ask the teacher-weachers here for helpy-welpy.
9789 : They told me to go ask Professor-wessor Koru-Moru. My brainy-wain is all in a bustle-wustle.
9790 : Ah! Have you sniffed out the slippery Sedal-Godjal?
9791 : ...I see. So that's why he gave up the principal position at the Aurastery and parted for parts unknown.
9792 : Of course, it's still unforgivable! However, since he seems to be regretting his actions and can't actually move from where he is, I guess we have to leave it at that.
9793 : Now, please return the magic doll.
9794 : ...Excuse me? You declare that the doll once gave you deceitful directions?
9795 : That's strange. It was thoroughly tested before I entrusted it to you. The easiest explanation is that the doll sensed an emanation of energy exceeding that of the ring.
9796 : In closing, there is the case of Mojiji... With the sudden cessation of Mojiji's correspondence, Professor Koru-Moru slid into an unsettling slump.
9797 : Let me just say that some of us struck on the same solution as sly old Sedal-Godjal...
9798 : I overheard you talking about Sedal-Godjal before. He always worried about things that I would just ignore. On issues such as student satisfaction he would ponder, I personally don't have that much precious time to squander.
9799 : I always say that keeping expectations low is best. By keeping to this simple rule, you'll never see me stressed.
9800 : Sedal-Godjal had a completely different nature to Professor Koru-Moru. I supposingly suppose that some people just can't enduringly endure certain hardships.
9801 : ...Hm? Me? I have overcomingly overcome such trivial trivialities. I am aware that all things in this world are transiently transient.
9802 : I'm so relieved that Sedal-Godjal was alright. I was worried that he'd met his demise in some horrible beastman's cookpot.
9803 : ...There's a mission here from Minister Apururu of the Manustery.
9804 : This mission hasn'taru actually been authorized by the Sibyl Guards. I've talked it over with the other gatehouse guards, and this is what we've decided...
9805 : %, please do everything in your power to help Minister Apururu.
9806 : Please go to the Manustery. Minister Apururu is waiting for you.
9807 : I also ask that you keep this mission a secretaru, especially from the Sibyl Guards.
9808 : I can't bear to see Miss Apururu's tears. I'll personally taru and feather anyone who messes with my Apururu!
9809 : I detestaru that Ajido-marujido. This is all his fault!
9810 : Minister Apururu hates it when people call her Miss Minster Apururu, so everybody leaves off the Miss.
9811 : She's also the youngest of the five ministers, but probably works the hardest at managing her ministry. It's still in the red, though...
9812 : PLeaSEtAkE tHIsmISsiON fRoMtHE mANusTEry. MoThERApUrUrU nEEdsYouR hELp.
9813 : Have you, like, brought me a letter from the Chieftainness in Kazham?
9814 : ...Huh? You're telling me the Temple of Uggalepih is totally crawling with icky monsters and stuff?
9815 : What a drag! ...But no, Angelica is not a girl who gives up that easily! It's been my lifelong dream to have that exhibition!
9816 : I'm not gonna change my mind. This is, like, a test to see whether I fall on my face, or spread my wings like a psychedelic butterfly!
9817 : You just wait right there. I'm gonna write a reply, and I want you to, like, take it back to Kazham for me, okay?
9818 : D'ya wanna hear my plan? With my paintings, that temple is gonna go from being a moldy old ruin to, like, a center for modern art.
9819 : Each piece will take totally ages, but real perfecto art takes real dedication, y'know? I'm ready for the long haul.
9820 : I'm not gonna throw away my dream! I'm gonna paint the canvas with my ambition! Hand me my brushes! Bring on the inspiration!
9821 : Mana Orbs...!!!
9822 : Hmph!!! What the hell do you know about Mana Orbs!?
9823 : ...Unbelievable! After I specifically told those little brats at the port not to talk to anyone about this!
9824 : ...What did you say!? You're friends with those meddlesome minors? Hmph! Aren't you embarrassed to tell people you hang around with kids at your age?
9825 : Well, that's your business, I guess. If you're buddy-wuddies with those whippersnappers, I have only this to say to you: Give me back my Mana Orb!
9826 : For the past few years, I've given % to the thief from Windurst Woods, Nanaa Mihgo, and had her search the towers of Sarutabaruta...
9827 : When I thought I finally had one within my grasp, that idiot Mithra dropped it somewhere! Do you know how much trouble I went through to find out it was those S.O.B.'s who had picked it up!?
9828 : I'm not letting this mattaru drop! You can deliver a message to them...
9829 : GIVE ME BACK MY MANA ORB!
9830 : For years I've had Nanaa Mihgo search...
9831 : Just thinking of that moronic Mithra losing my precious Mana Orb, only to have it claimed by a bunch of anklebiters... Argh, it makes my blood boil!
9832 : What the hell is this?
9833 : Are you trying to tell me to give up on my Mana Orb by giving me this?
9834 : You've got Yagudo droppings for brains, stripling! This has nothing to do with money!
9835 : And while I'm at it, you might as well know that I gave Nanaa Mihgo one % every week as payment for searching for that Mana Orb!
9836 : Take a look over here! Feast your eyes on all the wonderful goods that I possess! I'm rich beyond your wildest dreams!
9837 : I've got so many %, I'm throwing them away! Here, take one if it'll make you disappear and leave me be!
9838 : Hm? What're you making that face for?
9839 : I'll take this to the Manustery! It's a crime against Cardians to have a Mana Orb. You'll probably get thrown into prison and made to break rocks all day!
9840 : You've got Yagudo droppings for brains, stripling! This has nothing to do with money!
9841 : I can take this to the Manustery, you know! That is, if you don't mind those S.O.B.'s getting into hot water for hiding a Mana Orb!
9842 : ...!?
9843 : You used that Mana Orb on a Cardian!?
9844 : Er, I'm s-sorry.
9845 : ...Unbelievable... All that incredible power... Wasted on a useless puppet... A puppet...
9846 : That's it! Disassemble that Cardian right this instantaru!
9847 : Then pull out the Mana Orb and bring it here to me! You got that!?
9848 : How can you say that!? Diss-a-sem-bull means to take something apart, doesn't it?
9849 : Joker will die if we do that!
9850 : Here's a linkshell, tell somebody who cares! You've got no clue of the value of that Mana Orb, and I don't need to hear your meaningless sniveling!
9851 : That Mana Orb is more than it appears to be. Its worth is incalculable!
9852 : Go and start taking that automaton to pieces! You hear me!
9853 : I can't diss-a-sem-bull Joker, I just can't!
9854 : What am I going to do...?
9855 : Go and start taking that automaton to pieces! You hear me?
9856 : ...You again! What do you want with me now? Have you come to stand up for those S.O.B.'s? You're wasting your time!
9857 : Unless, of course, you're willing to listen to my offer. I'll make it worth your while, so you'd be smart to take me up on it.
9858 : Take the offer? Worth my while...? No thanks, ya big meanie.
9859 : You're not going to amount to much as an adventurer if you don't recognize your opportunities.
9860 : Well now, an adventurer worthy of the name. You realize you have to look at things with a cool head on your shoulders.
9861 : If what those S.O.B.'s say is true, I doubt they'll be able to disassemble that Cardian on their own.
9862 : I don't know too much about Cardians, but I'm sure it won't just sit there quietly while someone tries to take it to pieces. More than likely it'll lash out and we'll have all sorts of trouble on our hands.
9863 : This is where you come in. To keep the little moppets safe, you're going to have to be the one to do it.
9864 : They'll probably be upset with you for a long while, but they'll get over it. Surely you don't want to see them suffer over this mess any longer.
9865 : If you care for those kids, you'll take it upon yourself to do the dirty work... That's what adults are there for, right?
9866 : If you care for those kids, you'll take it upon yourself to do the dirty work... That's what adults are there for, right?
9867 : Unbelievable!
9868 : You're refusing to carry out the task you've already agreed to?
9869 : And you call yourself an adventurer? Only a fool would pass up the chance to work for me.
9870 : ...Fine, then. There's no sense going on about it. Plenty of other adventurers out there. I'll just find myself one with a backbone.
9871 : This conversation is over. Go live with your S.O.B. friends in your happy little fantasy world. That's more your level.
9872 : This conversation is over. Go live with your S.O.B. friends in your happy little fantasy world. That's more your level.
9873 : This is awful! Whatever is the Rhinostery to do...?
9874 : We...could...ask...the...minister...
9875 : It's too late for thataru! I've had a terrible premonition. If we don't act quickly, our city will be swallowed by darkness.
9876 : What's all this fuss and noise I hear? An emergency, huh? What's there to fear?
9877 : Leepe-Hoppe, where have you been? There's globby-wobs of miteslime all over the Priming Gate. The other side of the gate must be teeming with them.
9878 : Miteslime...is...the...secretion...of...the...starmite...bug...
9879 : The...starmite...is an...insect...that...feeds...on...tree...roots...
9880 : Oh my Goddess, this cannot be! You know the roots of the Great Star Tree, Are found beyond the Priming Gate, In Toraimarai Canal, oh why, cruel fate?
9881 : Exactly-wactly! With the magic disappearing from the water around here, Toraimarai Canal has stagnated.
9882 : But the real question is: Why on Vana'diel has the magic evaporated?
9883 : Whatever the reason, we are the only ones in Windurst rightaru now who can deal with this problem.
9884 : Desperate times call for desperate measures. I think we should give this adventurer full Rhinostery authorization.
9885 : Then we can have [him/her] exterminataru the bugs in Toraimarai Canal and pay [him/her] an appropriate reward.
9886 : Full Rhinostery authorization, you say? And hand [him/her] the %, come what may?
9887 : What else can we do? It would take agey-wages to call back the researchers from the field.
9888 : It...should be...okay...to give...emergency...authorization...to enter...the canal... Should be...
9889 : You're rightaru, this is an emergency. If this adventurer is up to it, let's give [him/her] Rhinostery authorization.
9890 : Alrighty-wighty? Will you work on our behalf? We want you to go bug-bashing-berserk in Toraimarai Canal.
9891 : Work for the Rhinostery? You called for an exterminator? Ewww, bugs!
9892 : ...... There are other adventurers who have worked for us in the past. We can try asking them, I suppose.
9893 : Greataru! Please use this %. If you show it to the Cardian at the Priming Gate and explain the emergency, it should let you in.
9894 : Collect three % from the starmites you squash, and we'll pay you # gil.
9895 : That % is proof that you are working for the Rhinostery. Show it to the Cardian on guard, and it will open the Priming Gate for you.
9896 : Enter Toraimarai Canal and squish those starmites. Gather three % from the bugs you bash, and we'll pay you # gil.
9897 : Our offer to you still stands. Will you work under Rhinostery authorization? You've always helped us before, rightaru?
9898 : Great...discoveries...are...being made...all...over...
9899 : Researchers...researching...fauna...have it...tough...
9900 : So...adventurers...with...Rhinostery...authorization...
9901 : have...all...left...Windurst...to help...
9902 : Lately, I've had so many dreams. But I don'taru remember them when I wake up...
9903 : I don't think I wantaru remember what I dreamed about. Maybe I'm subconsciously trying to forget them...
9904 : The % is not a toy, So use it properly, and be a good boy!
9905 : The Rhinostery's name you have in your hands, Please use it with honor, as your conscience demands! If you handle yourself badly, and none-too-politely, The Cardian at the gate will not take it lightly!
9906 : One, two, three...
9907 : Thank you! You squishy-squished a lot of those starmites.
9908 : Here's your reward... If possible, I'd like you to help us out again.
9909 : ...!
9910 : You...made it...back...okay?
9911 : Oh...good...
9912 : Ohbiru-Dohbiru and Kenapa-Keppa are making a nutrient-rich salve to repair the bug-bitten roots.
9913 : And Leepe-Hoppe is working on a smelly-welly repellent to use on the starmites. Keep up the good work until their research is complete.
9914 : Hmmm? Me? I'm the only meditation researcher, so I'll concentrate on my field of expertise--dreams.
9915 : Doctor Yoran-Oran is going to study, Starmite ecology for the Rhinostery!
9916 : Also, the fauna researchers are returning full speed, To Windurst, to help in our hour of need! I hope coming with them is the specialist guy, Who is versed in all things that concern Toraimarai!
9917 : Are you willing to head back into Toraimarai Canal? I'll pay you # gil for every three %.
9918 : Continue exterminating? I live to bash bugs! I'm a little busy...
9919 : Ahaha! That's what I like to hear from our Rhinostery adventurers. We're counting on you!
9920 : Good...luck...!
9921 : Hello, dearie! You're Pichichi's friend, aren't you? From the look on your face, I'd say there's a new Star Onion Brigade adventure brewing.
9922 : %... Pichichi didn't ask for that, did she? % is hard to make, even for me.
9923 : Out of all the materials needed to make %, % is the most importantaru and the most difficultaru to find. Have you heard of it before?
9924 : If you bring me %, I'll do my best to whip up what you need.
9925 : Out of all the materials needed to make %, % is the most importantaru and the most difficultaru to find. If you bring me %, I'll do my best to whip one up for you.
9926 : ...By the way, what were you thinking of using it for? If it's for something other than child's play, I'll put you over my knee, young [man/lady]!
9927 : You found it! Well, I'll be a moonstruck moogle.
9928 : Now, if I add this to this... Then...
9929 : Here you go! % you can use to disappear from sight. One of the most useful gadgets in the Junior Investigator's Toolkit!
9930 : Phew, I'm glad that worked. We would have been in a pickle if I had fizzled the synthesis and wasted those materials. Speaking of which, would you like a plate of rarab tail pickles before you go, dearie?
9931 : Hrmm! What!? There's no reason for me to feel guilty! I have absolutaruly no intention of defying the will of the Star Sibyl!
9932 : ...? What was that? You want me to lend you my % again?
9933 : Hrmm, I know what you're up to! You want to go back to the Animastery, don't you!?
9934 : There's no more reason for you to go there. In factaru, you really shouldn't. How would you talk yourself out of trouble-wouble if you happened to run into the Star Sibyl again?
9935 : ...Hrmm! What's that!? That's not the reason? You mean to break Ajido-Marujido out of the Dark Dungeon using my %!?
9936 : ...Hmmm... The Dark Dungeon, huh? They say that the Dark Dungeon drains a person's magical power, eventually killing them...
9937 : I doubtaru the Star Sibyl really intends to rob-wob Ajido-Marujido of his life. But she may be angry enough to rob him of his life as a mage.
9938 : Hrmm!? There was once a similar tragedy...I seem to recall... Now...who was that...?
9939 : ...In any case, I have not the slightest-wightest interest in doing anything that would benefitaru Ajido-Marujido. If you're looking for help from me, you've come to the wrong place. Now, get out of here!
9940 : ...!? Hrm? Just a momentaru...?
9941 : It can't be... Hrmm... That power I feel coming from you...
9942 : The magic has returned to the blank tome! It's a miracle...! This will mean the salvation of Windurst!
9943 : ...What!? You intend to have Ajido-Marujido read the book!? Don'taru be a fool! If you want someone to read it, then give it to me. I can...!
9944 : Great Goddess! I cannot... This is beyond my strength... I may be able to open it if I had the Diza Star of the Star Sibyl...
9945 : Hrmm... A wily wizard of Ajido-Marujido's power should be able to withstand this magic...
9946 : ......
9947 : ...I admit defeataru!
9948 : But if I help you get this book to Ajido-Marujido, you mustaru tell me what knowledge its pages contain.
9949 : I mustaru know the dangerous truth learned by Minister Karaha-Baruha.
9950 : Here, take my %. Return it to me as soon as your task is complete!
9951 : Hrm! Are we clear? Once you have Ajido-Marujido read the Book of the Gods, you mustaru tell me what knowledge is contained within.
9952 : Return my % as soon as your task is complete!
9953 : Where have you been? Did Ajido-Marujido get the book open!?
9954 : ...Hrmm, he's fallen into a coma, has he...? He must've been drawn into the World of the Book.
9955 : If he manages to return to consciousness, he will have all the knowledge contained within the Book of the Gods. ...If he makes it back, that is.

10026 : SORRY, CONTESTANT! THERE IS NO % HERE! BUT THANK YOU FOR PLAYING QUIZ DE VANA'DIEL!!!

10030 : Ah-ha! Here it is!
10031 : Yesh...I remember the shtudent that wrote thish. A probwematic bugger-wugger that boy was.
10032 : But that was a wong, wong time ago... Wait a minute. You anshered all the queshtions in QUIZ DE VANA'DIEW correctwy.
10033 : You weren't cheat-sheetin' now, were you? Well, no matter. Here's your prize. You earned it.
10034 : Uran-Mafran... It's been a long time since I've heard that name. He's been missingly missing since we were classmates at school.
10035 : ...I see. He encountered Ildy-Goldy in the Outlands? Ildy-Goldy would have been the last person he would have wanted to meetingly meet.
10036 : Why, you ask...? Haven't you heard the rumors about the incident that occuringly occurred in the Dark Dungeon?
10037 : I believingly believe he stole everyone's memories and left Windurst to avoid the repercussions of that crime.
10038 : ...But your warning is well taken. We'll be careful to watchingly watch out for any trouble. I don't know how much help I'll be, but I will gatheringly gather what information I can.
10039 : Huaaah... You want to know about Uran-Mafran...?
10040 : I remember him. Yes, I remember him very well.
10041 : Hmmm... So they finally found him, huh? I'm surprised he was still alive.
10042 : But besides that, how is Ildy-Goldy doing? He was in terrible-werrible shape after that Dark Dungeon incident...
10043 : I'll never forget when we all went to see him and heard that no magic or item could ever cure him...
10044 : I wonder if the reason Uran-Mafran left was to search for a way to cure Ildy-Goldy...?
10045 : %, we have another mission-wission for you from Minister Apururu. Please hurry on over to the Manustery.
10046 : It seems there's been a change in Minister Ajido-Marujido's condition. I do hope it's a change for the better...
10047 : Ah, before I forgetaru, Semih Lafihna is back in town. Please don't let any details of this mission reach those twitchy-witchy ears of hers.
10048 : There's been a change in Minister Ajido-Marujido's condition. Minister Apururu has requested your presence at the Manustery.
10049 : Semih Lafihna is back in town, so be careful to stay outaru of her way. She looked terribly-werribly tired though, and is probably resting up in Heavens Tower...
10050 : You probably don't know who Minister Ajido-Marujido and Miss Apururu's father is, do you?
10051 : Huh, your expression says otherwise. Has it become that well-known? I guess that was a silly-billy question to ask a well-connected adventurer like yourself.
10052 : Miss Apururu and her brother are in such a pickle-wickle... If their father, Zonpa-Zippa, was still with us, he would have saved them from this sticky situation.
10053 : ...... Or maybe things justaru would've gotten worse. Zonpa-Zippa was never known for being a particularly helpful-welpful guy...

10057 : We have heard accounts of roguey-wogue Cardians crossing Sarutabaruta. Have you heard or seen anything?
10058 : If we don't get confirmation for these sightings, we can't make a report to Heavens Tower. For the momentaru, I have my subordinates looking into it...
10059 : You wanna know what kind of person Zonpa-Zippa was?
10060 : ...Zonpa-Zippa was an extremely-wemely strict minister. He pushed our children to their limits with his unrelentaruing style of education.
10061 : He was particularly harsh with Ajido-Marujido.
10062 : ThE RoGUecARdiAnS aRewOrKIng tOWaRdS asiNgLE pURpoSe.
10063 : ThAt pURpoSecoULd onLyhAVe beEN gIVeNto tHe cARdiAnSby tHeIRcReAtoR.
10064 : A summons has been issued from Heavens Tower. Hmm? There doesn't seem to be an emblem from the Star Sibyl here anywhere... I wonder who this mission-wission is from.
10065 : In any eventaru, this mission appears to be Yagudo-related. It says the Yagudo have proposed a revision of the peace treaty.
10066 : Semih Lafihna mustaru be busy in her dealings with the Yagudo.
10067 : I mean, I really thoughtaru we guards would be severely-werely punished over that business with Minister Ajido-Marujido, but so far, not a word has been said.
10068 : A summons has been issued for you from Heavens Tower. The mission-wission concerns a proposal from the Yagudo to revise the peace treaty.
10069 : ...This makes me all queasy-weasy for some reason. Miss Apururu hasn't been arrested over the Dark Dungeon jailbreak, and we guards haven't been subjectarued to any disciplinary action.
10070 : I guess all that hullabaloo was cleared up at the same time Minister Ajido-Marujido was grantarued pardon by the Star Sibyl.
10071 : Isn'taru it about time for the five ministries to have their meeting?
10072 : But with the way things have been lately-wately, I wouldn'taru be surprised if they skip-pipped it. Minister Ajido-Marujido hasn't even returned to the Orastery yet.
10073 : Even with Minister Ajido-Marujido's return to consciousness and the pardoning of his crimes, Miss Apururu still looks all pasty-wasty!
10074 : She mustaru be working too hard. The Cardians should be doing all the menial tasks of the Manustery!
10075 : TheRe aRemAnY siTuAtiOnSaNd PHeNo-meNoNsiN tHe WoRLdtHAt aReiMpoSsiBLe topRediCT.

10078 : %... First, allow me to apologize. I hadn'taru realized what an enormous responsibility you had taken upon yourself.
10079 : Secondly, you have my gratitude. Thanks to you, Windurst has regained two hugey-wuge sources of power.
10080 : One of those is, of course, the protection of the Stars and the Moon. We mages can sense the return of its inexplicable energy.
10081 : The other is the trust that has been rekindled between the Mithra and the Tarutaru. This is a treasure that mustaru never be lost to us.
10082 : I have a distantaru relative, an adventurer by trade, who said he had seen a Tarutaru being held captive by mandragora in a dungeon somewhere.
10083 : Could that be the missing Principal of the Aurastery, perhaps? If it is, maybe it would be bestaru just to leave things well alone.
10084 : Seeing the smiley-wiley faces of the children when I do my rounds of Windurst Waters justaru blows my tiredness away.
10085 : And to top it all off, even the Mithra we pass have begun greeting us in a friendly fashion. Isn't that greataru?
10086 : We cARdiAnSrUn oN tHePoWEr oFtHe sTArS.
10087 : MaYBe tHAtExPLaiNs iT.TeN hAs fELtsO WOndeRFuLwaLKiNg uNdeRNeAThtHe niGHt sKythEsE dAYs.
10088 : ...If TeNwErE to PuTtHAt FeELiNgiNTo wORdSit woULd BeLiKe...
10089 : A FuLLBeLLy. ..Hmm.MaYBe TeNnEEdS to hAVesOmE MaiNTeNAnCeDoNe...
10090 : I've been waiting for you! Have you seen Ajido-Marujido? I justaru can't seem to get hold of him.
10091 : It's unthink-winkable that the Minister of the Orastery should know the secrets of the Book of the Gods while the Minister of the Optistery wallows in ignorance!
10092 : My position demands I gain the knowledge contained within that tome! I'll take this directaruly to the Star Sibyl!
10093 : I've been meaning to ask, my adventurer friend, Have you met our researchers beyond this land's end?
10094 : I speak of the scholars who brave ice, wind, and heat. They study protocrystals. They're the best, our elite.
10095 : Have you met them? We're on a first-name basis. Haven't had the pleasure.
10096 : Well, that justaru won't do. Come see me again when you know who's who.
10097 : We have this new theory that'll make your mind race: The crystals contain a dimensional space!
10098 : This dimension exists in Vana'diel, we think, as a home for great beings--as some kind of link.
10099 : Avatars is the name that we've chosen to call these dimensional beings. And the reason is all...
10100 : ...because of this %. This gem. If you sit still and listen, you just might hear him...
10101 : Collect the whispers...
10102 : ...of the six Avatars...
10103 : ...that slumber within...
10104 : ...the crystals.
10105 : The voice of %, could you hear what it said? It never stops droning those words in my head!
10106 : This world's protocrystals number six in all. Six Avatars lay dormant, awaiting your call...
10107 : Gather the whispers. What could they be? I'm afraid that the word has no meaning to me.
10108 : If, my brave soul, you are able to find these six phantom whispers, then drop me a line.
10109 : With this % begging for aid, how could we think to not take up its crusade?
10110 : In the history of Vana'diel, to see such a number of % is a mysterious wonder.
10111 : It must be important to make such a fuss. But these whispers are still an enigma to us.
10112 : If you manage to get all six whispers in hand,  come let me know and we'll see what fate's planned.
10113 : You've brought back the whispers? You've gathered all six? Don't try to fool me with childish tricks!
10114 : ...
10115 : ...? Nothing's changed that I can see. Are you sure that you're not kidding me?
10116 : Take the six whispers...
10117 : ...to the lair of...
10118 : ...Fenrir.
10119 : Wow! % changed right before our eyes! It's become %, isn't this a surprise!
10120 : And did I hear the name Fenrir justaru then? Could this mean you must go to the Great Beast's den...?
10121 : If I understand this one-sided conversation, the Full Moon Fountain is your next destination!
10122 : But no one may enter without the right power: a magical charm from Heavens Tower...
10123 : With my power...
10124 : ...one may pass.
10125 : Are you saying that you can get one person through? But what if your friends want to accompany you, too?
10126 : It seems that % will be needed for each of your pals who join in on this great fountain breach.
10127 : I'll gather more % for all, so tell all your friends I'm the guy they should call!
10128 : Carbuncle says he will help you get through, but once at the fountain it's all up to you. Make sure you are ready for trouble or strife; rushing in without care could cost you your life!
10129 : It seems that % will be needed for each of your pals who join in on this great fountain breach.
10130 : I'll gather more % for all, so tell all your friends I'm the guy they should call!
10131 : Oh, there you are, my adventurous friend! I'd feared that this fountain foray'd spelled your end!
10132 : Carbuncle had wanted to tell to Fenrir, the things that transpire in our world out here...?
10133 : I'm quite sure that Fenrir's failure to show himself up above has been quite a blow.
10134 : Our little blue friend here has been all alone. Is the reason for Fenrir's behavior well known...?
10135 : Fenrir is, just as we are, one of the new energies born to the world of Vana'diel.
10136 : We new powers are a part of Vana'diel. We must abide by its rules, and can die just like any other beast.
10137 : The avatars, on the other hand, are lifeforces that belong to an ancient order of things.
10138 : As the ancient past of Vana'diel now sleeps, the lifeforces of the avatars are bound in torpor.
10139 : Vana'diel belongs to you as much as it belongs to us. You must see the true nature of your world.
10140 : In time, you will come to understand that Vana'diel must be returned to its true form. You will understand what you were born to do.
10141 : Hold out your hand. The blessings of Fenrir are now yours.
10142 : What do you desire? %. %. %. %. %. Gil. A pact with Fenrir. A pact with Fenrir as a mount.
10143 : This is your choice?
10144 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10145 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10146 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10147 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10148 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
10149 : Gil is what you truly want? Yes. Wait!
10150 : Are you sure? Yes. Wait!
10151 : Goodbye for now...lifeforces of Vana'diel...
10152 : Did I dream all of that, or was it all real!? Carbuncle's speech was beyond me, I feel.
10153 : The new energies born to our dear Vana'diel.  The avatars ancient and slumbering still.
10154 : This could be the start of a new study craze! You could spend your whole life in a researcher's daze!
10155 : But % will be in great need! They might speak again, and those words we must heed!
10156 : This could be the start of a new study craze! You could spend your whole life in a researcher's daze!
10157 : But % will be in great need! They might speak again, and those words we must heed!
10158 : We meet yet again, my far-traveling friend! Are these meetings of ours becoming a trend?
10159 : % are filled with his essence. Carbuncle's multiple, world-spanning presence.
10160 : I figured it out; the mystery's unfurled! He uses these rubies to spy on the world!
10161 : And now once again he is talking to us. This % has much to discuss!
10162 : We've taken the words of that ruby to heart, and had other adventurers go do their part. Collecting those whispers must be quite a trial! I'm glad that you heroes are still able to smile!
10163 : Go to the fountain, and just like before, you'll be facing the Great Beast Fenrir's fearsome maw!
10164 : Head to the fountain again? Sure! Not again...
10165 : Remember that % will be needed for each of your pals who join in on this great fountain breach.
10166 : You're off on your journey? Good luck and take care! Adventurers like you are certainly rare!
10167 : Thank you for what you have done for us--for what you have done for Vana'diel.
10168 : Wait! Hold up there, I wanted to ask you...! I thought you could answer a question or two...
10169 : You know, I've been thinking about this whole thing. How Carbuncle's got you whisper collecting...
10170 : I wonder if this isn't just some grand farce to slowly steal power from the avatars?
10171 : This tale has its share of twists, turns, and bends! I'm definitely curious to see how it ends!
10172 : You are now able to summon Fenrir!
10173 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.

10185 : I'll be sure to ask for your help again in the future.
10186 : Hey, [Mister/Miss] Adventurer! Can you spare a momentaru for the ecology of Vana'diel?
10187 : Got a momentaru? Alrighty-wighty. Not rightaru now.
10188 : Have you heard of the Maze of Shakhrami?
10189 : Exactaruly, those creepy-weepy caves found between the Tahrongi Canyon and Buburimu Peninsula.
10190 : There have been signs that some beasties have been feasting on the corpses down there... Ewww!
10191 : We've been trying to get an adventurer to go there and exterminataru the creatures, but haven't had much luck. Will you help us?
10192 : Take on the task? Sure, I love mazes! I get lost in my own Mog House...
10193 : Excellentaru! Bring me back proof that you've trouncy-wounced the beasties, and I'll pay you a reward from the Vana'diel Environmental Resource Management Initiative Network fund.
10194 : Our V.E.R.M.I.N. field agent, Ahko Mhalijikhari, will be waiting in the maze to give you further instructions. Ta-taru and good luck!

10207 : This year, those who make special undecennial combinations will receive particularly egg-ceptional prizes, kupo!

10228 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
10229 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
10230 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
10231 : You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
10232 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
10233 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!

10235 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
10236 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
10237 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
10238 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
10239 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
10240 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
10241 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
10242 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
10243 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
10244 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
10245 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
10246 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
10247 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
10248 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
10249 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
10250 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
10251 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
10252 : You can only carry one %.
10253 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
10254 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
10255 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
10256 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
10257 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
10258 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
10259 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
10260 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
10261 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
10262 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
10263 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
10264 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
10265 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
10266 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...

10312 : Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times: Match 1: # Match 2:  Match 3:
10313 : Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of # gil is required before each match.
10314 : Travel to the Isle? Yes. Not yet.
10315 : What would you like to know about? Basic rules. Official/private matches. Flammen-Brenner. Flamme. Match score. Petras and quarrying. Sprint. KO. Return.
10316 : The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:
10317 : First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of Flammen-Brenner.
10318 : At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with Flamme, or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
10319 : Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
10320 : The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
10321 : The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
10322 : If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The match score section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
10323 : Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
10324 : You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
10325 : No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
10326 : The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed # members, or if there are fewer than # members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
10327 : Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
10328 : LS Liga is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
10329 : A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
10330 : The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
10331 : If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
10332 : After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
10333 : Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
10334 : In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
10335 : Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
10336 : Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
10337 : However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
10338 : Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
10339 : Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
10340 : The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
10341 : In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
10342 : In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
10343 : I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
10344 : What do you wish to know about? Basic rules. About the Petra. About Sprint. About Scout. About Gate Breach. About area-specific rules. About returning to battle. About special rules. Nothing at the moment.
10345 : Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word ballista means to throw a stone, and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.
10346 : The rules are simple. Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.
10347 : Players from both teams must search for Petras that a Herald has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as Rooks.
10348 : These Rooks can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their Petras into them.
10349 : Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.
10350 : Petras can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the Quarry (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.
10351 : Sometimes a player may find items other than Petras, such as potions. These temporary items can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).
10352 : Players can carry more than one Petra, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them. However, players will lose their Petras if they: (1) Successfully throw them into a rook. (2) Leave the area. (3) Are knocked out.
10353 : But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the Sprint command while in possession of a Petra. And, players can only use the Scout command if they carry one of the stones.
10354 : As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.
10355 : All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the Sprint command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain Petras.
10356 : However, remember that once a player has obtained a Petra, he or she will be unable to use the Sprint command. In its place, though, one may use the Scout command.
10357 : The locations of the Rooks are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.
10358 : Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate Rooks. However, another way is by using the Scout command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest Rook.
10359 : Finally, Scout can only be used when a player is carrying a Petra. Because Sprint cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.
10360 : So, a Petra has been obtained and a Rook located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.
10361 : There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.
10362 : To throw a Petra into a Rook, a player must first wait until the Rook's gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.
10363 : But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve Gate Breach status. Only then will his or her shots count.
10364 : This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.
10365 : Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.
10366 : The following match types are area-specific: All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains
10367 : Best of Three series rules are as follows: Winning a match will earn a nation one match point. The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for come-from-behind victories.
10368 : Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.
10369 : Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.
10370 : When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.
10371 : For more information on temporary items, refer to the special rules.
10372 : After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.
10373 : If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.
10374 : Please note that many of the rules previously considered special have been fully implemented. Also, several new special rules have been added.
10375 : Learn about which special rules? Temporary items. Ballista Points. Scoring restrictions. Gate Breach radius expansion. Resistance to Sleep. Open entries. Minimum level restrictions. Re-entry restrictions. Participant & Rook numbers. Experience Points. Return.
10376 : Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as temporary items for use at any time during the match.
10377 : Players can hold up to ten temporary items, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.
10378 : If players who possess ten temporary items find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.
10379 : Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.
10380 : Finally, the Heralds will collect temporary items when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.
10381 : Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is #.
10382 : While it is taken into consideration, scoring Petras is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.
10383 : Ballista Points can be traded for special vouchers, which may be exchanged for free temporary items at the start of new matches.
10384 : However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match. Speak with a Marshal directly after a match to register your points.
10385 : Players will only be allowed to score up to five Petras at a time. Also, a player's Gate Breach status will be automatically disengaged if a Petra is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.
10386 : All allies within a certain radius will achieve Gate Breach status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.
10387 : Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.
10388 : During the entry period, from #:, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.
10389 : In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced: Level 30 matches: 130
10390 : Level 40 matches: 3140 Level 50 matches: 4150 Level 60 matches: 5160 Unrestricted matches: 61
10391 : Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.
10392 : When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.
10393 : Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.
10394 : Read which chapter on B.P. Ranking? Basic Information. Registering Points. Rewards. Chevron & Title List. None.
10395 : Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.
10396 : Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register [his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.
10397 : After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.
10398 : If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, [he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special chevron as well as a new title.
10399 : There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as two different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty-two jobs.
10400 : Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, [he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.
10401 : Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.
10402 : However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.
10403 : Finally, checking someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.
10404 : View which chevron/title? 1st (overall). 2nd (overall). 3rd (overall). 4th-10th (overall). 1st (warrior). 1st (monk). 1st (white mage). 1st (black mage). 1st (red mage). 1st (thief). 1st (paladin). 1st (dark knight). 1st (beastmaster). 1st (bard). 1st (ranger). 1st (samurai). 1st (ninja). 1st (dragoon). 1st (summoner). 1st (blue mage). 1st (corsair). 1st (puppetmaster). 1st (dancer). 1st (scholar). 1st (geomancer). 1st (rune fencer).

10447 : Windurst!
10448 : Oho
10449 : Ohoho
10450 : So this is our homeland?
10451 : Nope, this is our daddy's homeland!
10452 : Nah, you're wrong, it's our mom's homeland!
10453 : Which means...
10454 : That this is our homeland, too?
10455 : You're hopeless!
10456 : I'm kinda hungry.
10457 : Yeah, me too.
10458 : ...
10459 : Let's go look for our father!
10460 : Dad!?
10461 : Daddy!?
10462 : Our father would be a genius, just like us.
10463 : Our dad would be powerful, just like us.
10464 : Our daddy would be someone really important.
10465 : Father!
10466 : Dad!
10467 : Daddy!
10468 : What's that? You want to know about the allied expedition?
10469 : Iru-Kuiru...a...researcher...from...the...Rhinostery...
10470 : ...was the...representative...from...Windurst.
10471 : He was banished from the Rhinostery and lostaru his life somewhere in the Outlands.
10472 : If you want to know more about him, you should have a chitchat with Doctor Yoran-Oran in Windurst Walls.
10473 : I'm not sure he'll be willing to tell you what Iru-Kuiru was researching, mind you. It's probably super-duper-confidential information.
10474 : If you want to know more about Iru-Kuiru, you should have a chitchat with Doctor Yoran-Oran in Windurst Walls.
10475 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... What's that? You have a question you want to ask me, the man on the spot?
10476 : You wanna know if three Tarutaru wearing strange clothing were here while I was stewing over my stew?
10477 : I did see three Tarutaru with appetites almost as big as mine, if that helps. Munch-munch...chew-chew...slurp...
10478 : Ooh, I'm stuffed.
10479 : I think I've gone up three belly sizes.
10480 : I shouldn't have had that last roast rarab...
10481 : Wow, I thought our number was up when that humongous dragon got his claws into us.
10482 : That big lizard left us without two gil to rub together.
10483 : ... You know, I've been thinking...
10484 : I don't think that guy was our father.
10485 : Nah, not our dad.
10486 : Nope, not our daddy.
10487 : Our father would be someone with a lot more cash.
10488 : Yeah, our mom had that huge gem, after all.
10489 : And that lovely fur coat.
10490 : Right, then. Let's go look for our real father!
10491 : Here we come, Dad!
10492 : Ready or not!
10493 : ...And that's when they took off towards the south part of Windurst Waters. Munch-munch...chew-chew...
10494 : What do you want? This is the house of the ridiculously wealthy Honoi-Gomoi!
10495 : Father!
10496 : Dad, we missed you!
10497 : Daddy, your beautiful children are here!
10498 : What in blazes are you three babbling aboutaru!?
10499 : You probably didn't know it, Father, but we were in Mother's tummy when you were separated.
10500 : In Mommy's tummy!
10501 : And that's why we've been looking for you all this time!
10502 : Looking for you, Daddy!
10503 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... I heard everything! I knew it was a good idea to follow those unnaturally hungry Tarutaru in the search for their long-lost father!
10504 : This scoop is going to mean another Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for the man on the spot!
10505 : Now justaru a darn second there, newspaper boy!
10506 : This is all your fault, you nonsense-spouting troublemakers! What annoying pit did you crawl out of!?
10507 : We're from Tavnazia!
10508 : We were blown through the air, over the seas and mountains!
10509 : We came to meet you, Father!
10510 : Tavnazia? That former city, now big hole in the ground, Tavnazia? I mean, I used to travel there quite often on business before it was destroyed...
10511 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... You admit it! You've been to Tavnazia!
10512 : Then these three really are your children...
10513 : I thought I told you to hold on a darn second! You've got the wrong Tarutaru! On my trips to Tavnazia, I only ever met with the scoundrels in Atarefaunet's band!
10514 : Do you three know anything aboutaru Atarefaunet's band of thieves?
10515 : The name hasn't come up so often since the leader, Atarefaunet, got himself executarued...
10516 : Just hearing that name was enough to make children wail in fear! A ruthless gang of banditarus, if ever there was one!
10517 : Because of my dealings with Atarefaunet's band, the Tavnazian Cathedral put out a warrant for my arrestaru. I had no time for dates or dilly-dallying!
10518 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... What a juicy story!
10519 : Another scoop for the man on the spot! Honoi-Gomoi Confesses to Deeds Unsavory!
10520 : Don'taru get ahead of yourself! You've got no proof! If you write any filthy articles about me, I'll have you thrown in jail for libel!
10521 : Proof! Yes!  Where's your proof!?
10522 : Show me proof that I'm your father!
10523 : We don't have anything around here, Daddy.
10524 : We have proof in Tavnazia, Dad.
10525 : But we don't have any money to get back there, Father.
10526 : You don't have the money to take an airship?
10527 : I'll give you as much as you need! Justaru get out of my house! Out!
10528 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... Hold on a momentaru! The man on the spot would like to ask you a few questions!
10529 : Why does this have to happen to me!?
10530 : I'll sue the pants off that journalist if he writes anything incriminating...
10531 : What's that? Yoran-Oran said a Mimeo Mirror could help clear up any doubts?
10532 : I...I've got one of those! It's a little cracked, though...
10533 : Take this to Yoran-Oran. He should be able to fix it!
10534 : Take that % to Yoran-Oran. He should be able to fix it!
10535 : I can use that mirror to show people my memories of Tavnazia...?
10536 : That...that's impossible! Now give it back! Give me back my mirror!
10537 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... I was able to find out all sorts of juicy details from that article.
10538 : But I'll have to skip lunch to investigate justaru how authentic this story really is...munch-munch...
10539 : If you're looking for those three Tarutaru, they headed for the air travel agency. If I recall, there's a reporter around that area who works for the same boss as the man on the spot...chew-chew...
10540 : Hrm. Hrmmm... Hrrrmmmmmm...hrm!
10541 : I can't seem to concentrate on my work today. Why do I keep having this strange feeling that something...
10542 : Father!
10543 : Dad, we missed you!
10544 : Daddy, your beautiful children are here!
10545 : Hrm!? Who are you three supposed to be!?
10546 : You probably didn't know it, Father, but we were in Mother's tummy when you were separated.
10547 : In Mommy's tummy!
10548 : And that's why we've been looking for you all this time!
10549 : Looking for you, Daddy!
10550 : H-hold on a moment! You think that I'm your father!? I'm old enough to be your grandfather!
10551 : Grandpappy?
10552 : Could he be our grandpa?
10553 : We've come all the way from Tavnazia to look for our father...
10554 : Hrmmmm!? Tavnazia!? I'm afraid neither I nor my daughter have ever been to Tavnazia...
10555 : That's weird. We heard that our father was the Minister of the Optistery...
10556 : You're not our dad, Minister Karaha-Baruha!?
10557 : Hrm!? Karaha-Baruha!? You three are the children of Karaha-Baruha!?
10558 : That's right! Our father is Karaha-Baruha!
10559 : That's why our lives are in danger!
10560 : That's why we came looking for our daddy to help us!
10561 : How could Karaha-Baruha have children... I'm flabbergasted... Now that I think about it, he did mention something about a trip to Tavnazia...
10562 : He said he'd had an encounter that would change the history of Vana'diel's people. Could he have meant his meeting with your mother? Hrm!
10563 : Oh, my poor little ones. I have some terrible news for you.
10564 : The great and powerful Karaha-Baruha passed away twenty years ago...
10565 : He perished from the incredible summoning magic he used to save our beloved Windurst.
10566 : Karaha-Baruha is dead!?
10567 : He died from using summoning magic!?
10568 : We're doomed!
10569 : I'm sure you are terribly-werribly shaken by all this... My sincere condolences, children of Karaha-Baruha.
10570 : But do not despair. As the successor of all matters relating to the Optistery, I will do everything in my power to aid you.
10571 : Everything in your power?
10572 : You don't seem to be powerful at all, Grandpa.
10573 : And you don't look rich either, Grandpappy.
10574 : Hrm! I suppose I have no more power or money than most people...
10575 : However, I am known as the Fountain of Knowledge! All the information in the books you see before you is indelibly etched into my magnificent memory!
10576 : Go ahead, ask me anything you wish to know.
10577 : Hmmm. Okay, who are the Kuluu?
10578 : The Kuluu were an ancient race that no longer exists in our time.
10579 : What about the Zilart?
10580 : That is also the name of an ancient race that no longer exists in our time.
10581 : How about Bahamut?
10582 : That would be the name of the ancient king of the wyrms that no longer exists in our time.
10583 : Amazing.
10584 : You managed to get every question wrong.
10585 : What!? What are you talking about!?
10586 : One more question: Who is Nag'molada?
10587 : Nag'molada... Hrm!? Isn't that the name of a Jeunoan diplomat? I believe he was responsible for adjudicating talks between the three nations during the time of the war...
10588 : Wow! I knew he was somebody important!
10589 : He's important, powerful, and rich!
10590 : He could've been our daddy if he were a Tarutaru!
10591 : What are you whispering about? Have you come to realize my greatness, children of Karaha-Baruha?
10592 : Um, yeah. We're gonna head for Jeuno now, Grandfather!
10593 : Head for Jeuno!
10594 : Jeuno!
10595 : Kuluu, Zilart, Bahamut... Those are all names found in my dustiest and mustiest of tomes--and those tomes say that all three perished long, long ago!
10596 : I'm not going to believe any of this rubbly rubbish unless someone brings one of those Zilart here before my eyes!
10597 : Whoa! Your aura is blinding! What on Vana'diel are you carrying!?
10598 : Look, I can't sleep with you standing there like a muddled mandragora.
10599 : Hm? You're looking for a girl with crikey-spiky hair you could use as nails?
10600 : Oh, I know the one. She was taken to Doctor Yoran-Oran's mansion.
10601 : But are you a friend of hers? That girl is a disastaru waiting to happen. Unlike the light I see in your aura, she is surrounded by a dark, creepy-weepy cloud.
10602 : It is that very cloud of doom and gloom that has made her a target of the great being I see in my dreams.
10603 : But now that someone, somewhere has activatarued the ruins of Pso'Xja, that great being can no longer act freely-weely.
10604 : The being is so furious-wurious over losing its prey, I don'taru think I'll be seeing any pleasantaru dreams for a while...
10605 : I told them that girl was a disastaru waiting to happen, but did they listen? Noooo. I'm just going to wash my hands of the whole thing.
10606 : Hey, you're the mangy adventurer that was with Sir Louverance. You're not getting in his way now, are you? Hm?
10607 : He said that he was heading on business for a tiny island to the southeast of Mhaura. You'd better not be thinking of following him!
10608 : We've been busy lately, with no time for fun. So today is a day for just soaking up sun.
10609 : You gotta help me, I'm in serious trouble. I'm headed for needles and my life is a bubble...
10610 : When death is before you, it really is true. Your memories flash right before you, they do.
10611 : This all occurred not a moment ago. I'll fill you in on my grim tale of woe...
10612 : I was just standing here, in a half-asleep daze, When an ominous shadow blocked out the warm rays...
10613 : It's r-r-rightaru this way!!!
10614 : Y-y-you're on your own f-f-from here!!!
10615 : Huh? This is the one rrresponsible for the tuning forks?
10616 : You don't look particularly special or brrright to me.
10617 : I'm really quite clever, though I don't look like much! And who might you be to pass judgment and such?
10618 : Watch your tongue, sunshine! I am a Mithran Tracker!
10619 : I'll harvest your head and have it drrrying on the windowsill before you can blink!
10620 : <Gulp!>
10621 : Why did you bring this sin hunter here!? Are you trying to make me keel over in fear?
10622 : Ronta-Onta!?
10623 : Let me clear things up for you. I have come from the Mithran homeland.
10624 : I met that Tarutaru in Kazham, where I was looking into tuning forks. He told me you were the specialist in the field.
10625 : I'm not the patient type, kiddo. You will tell me everything you know about these devices.
10626 : <Gulp!>
10627 : Hmmm, I see. So these tuning forks can't actually be used to split the protocrystals?
10628 : After going through my inquisition this many times, I guess you must be telling the truth.
10629 : ...
10630 : But I want to shatter the protocrystals.
10631 : How do you break them? Come on, think! There must be a way!
10632 : I'm telling you, what you're asking can't be done. Do you think I'm repeating myself just for fun...?
10633 : If you must insist on asking again, I'll explain it once more. Here, use my pen!
10634 : The crystal's interior is an avatar's domain. An alternate dimension not found on this plane.
10635 : These realms are each pulsing with elemental might. Comparatively, the same power in this world is slight.
10636 : That's why protocrystals won't break from out here! They're indestructible! Am I making this clear?
10637 : Unless the great beings themselves wish it so, The crystals resist any physical blow!
10638 : Is that right...?
10639 : ...
10640 : Then you'll just have to convince the avatars to listen to you, won't you, sugar?
10641 : Convince those great beings to listen to me...? Do you really think it'll be that easy?
10642 : Listen, sweetcakes. Do you have any idea what I've been through to get to this point?
10643 : I have visited almost every single protocrystal there is.
10644 : But your great beings--the sleeping gods--won't listen to a word I have to say.
10645 : They just spout out nonsensical questions and answers. It's as if they don't even rrrealize I'm there.
10646 : You rrresearchers don't intend to participate in this farce forever, do you?
10647 : If you think hard enough, there is an answer for everything.
10648 : Now, you better start thinking like your life depends on it! Because it does, sweetheart. It's your job to figure out prrroblems, right?
10649 : <Gulp!>
10650 : Alrightaru, don't get your tail in a twist! Give me back my pen and I'll start on a list.
10651 : So, your goal is to be able to have a straight talk? I'll need to start work on a new tuning fork!
10652 : A device of raw power beyond any I've made! I can't promise you'll survive it unscathed, I'm afraid!
10653 : There you go, twinkletoes. See what you can accomplish with the thrrreat of death looming over you?
10654 : This is the kind of thing I live for. With a job that calls for constant battle, my life is always on the line!
10655 : See you later, sweetcheeks. Be sure to let me know when the tuning fork is rrready.
10656 : %, %, and %...
10657 : These will be all the materials I'll need! My new tuning fork formula must succeed!
10658 : Adventurer, you heard all three items I stated? Your visit today must've surely been fated!
10659 : Bring me those items, I humbly implore you! I swear on my name that I'll pay you your due!
10660 : Where in the world can I find these three things...? They're almost as rare as dread dragon wings.
10661 : %, %, and %...
10662 : Won'taru anyone out there hear my sad pleas...? I'd even be willing to pay finder's fees...
10663 : Thank you! Oh, thank you! Here, take your reward! In Altana's grace, my faith you've restored!
10664 : Now it is time for my revenge to be felt! I'll hand the great beings that sin hunter's pelt!
10665 : Thank you! Oh, thank you! Here, take your reward! In Altana's grace, my faith you've restored!
10666 : Now it is time for my revenge to be felt! I'll hand the great beings that sin hunter's pelt!
10667 : I wonder what happened? Where could she be? I guess it's fair justice for threatening me...
10668 : Ah, it's you! My adventuring friend! Perhaps to my worries an ear you could lend?
10669 : I finished the fork, then I handed it to, That Mithran sin hunter. She was pleased, I tell you.
10670 : She packed up the fork, and then left right away. I've not seen her since that most harrowing day...
10671 : Of course, that new fork has never been tested. I hope that it worked in the way she requested...
10672 : It's possible the Mithra has been trapped inside. I would just forget it. And oh, how I've tried!
10673 : But I can't leave a lady to such a grim fate. So I've called upon stalwart Ildy-Goldy the Great!
10674 : Do you know of our Ildy, the one and the only? He protects us on trips to lands far, wild, and lonely!
10675 : With his fighting skills he's sure to compete, On a level that rivals the Mithra elite!
10676 : Plus, they both wear those creepy black helms. I'm sure that they've traveled in similar realms.
10677 : Vhat vas that aboutaru creepy helms...?
10678 : Oh! Ildy-Goldy, have you made any progress? Have you found that formidable Mithra sin huntress?
10679 : It is mostaru veird. I did speak vith several persons who had seen a dark-helmeted Mithra...
10680 : The Rhinostery researchers in Beaucedine say she vas headed in the direction of Xarcabard.
10681 : Xarcabard? Why'd she go there? Fei'Yin is the spot for an avatar's lair.
10682 : ... Vhen I vas still a student, I vonce read a thesis written by Professor Iru-Kuiru.
10683 : It talked of the Mithran belief that a crystal of darkness exists in Xarcabard.
10684 : Iru-Kuiru vas on friendly-viendly terms vith the Mithra of Kazham.
10685 : It might be bestaru to try speaking vith them about this matter.
10686 : Now that you mention it, I'm fairly sure, Our sin hunter came from that southerly shore.
10687 : Vell then, it's settled. Adventurer, come and meet me in Kazham. The chieftainness may have some answer-vanswers for us.
10688 : Don'taru forget to put safety first. Like poor Iru-Kuiru, try not to get cursed.
10689 : An allied expedition member was he. A researcher from our beloved Rhinostery.
10690 : If you want to help Ildy along, Put on your trunks and swim to Kazham!
10691 : The triumphant adventurer returns from his quest! Ildy told us you passed every trial and test!
10692 : As thanks for your help in this troublesome case, Here's a helmet that sells at incredible pace!
10693 : I've made it so it can be worn by we mages! It's sending the milliner into red rages!
10694 : Goodebyongo! Wingdorsht tooo fhar awayz fhrum mai hormtowne! Dropt arll goodhys whylle ahn trripp!
10695 : Helgohelgo! Me's bhrink goodhys arll ja wayz fhrum hormtowne ovf Morvalporlis!
10696 : I'm a chef-in-training, don'taru you know? One day I'll be as famous-wamous as that Rycharde character in Mhaura.
10697 : I'm racking my noggin to inventaru a dish that tastes better when eaten with friends. Nothing comes to mind at the momentaru...
10698 : You know, I heard there was a new fortune teller in Mhaura. Those guys kind of give me the chilly-willies.
10699 : Eureka!
10700 : Seeing you and % together has spark-warked an idea for a new cooking craze!
10701 : Inspiration can strike at the strangest times. Here, try this!
10702 : Wait! Could it be!?
10703 : Yes! Another marv-warvellous idea for a feeding frenzy! I'll call it Friendship Pie with Trust Crust! Doesn't that sound yummy-scrummy?
10704 : Since you and % were here to witness this culinary triumph, why don'taru you share this in celebration?
10705 : Hmmm. Hmmm. Nope, my brill-williance has run dry. There is only so much one Tarutaru can dream up alone.
10706 : I'll have to find myself a chum-wummy partner like you have in %.
10707 : In factaru, you two can share this between you. I've lost my appetitaru.
10708 : You are currently at event status ##. The title you need is .
10709 : You obtain two %!
10710 : Hey! You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right? Take this letter to that [cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?
10711 : Excuse me, [mister/lady]. Would you take this letter to the [guy/lady] in the red hat?
10712 : Adventurer-[man/lady]! Could you take this letter to that funny [guy/lady] in the red hat?
10713 : I would like to take this letter to a certain [fellow/woman] wearing a red chapeaux; however, my parents do not allow me to stray far from home. Kind adventurer, might you deliver it in my stead?
10714 : Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
10715 : Whoa! Thanks, [misterrr/lady]!
10716 : Thank you so very much, [sir/ma'am]!
10717 : Another present? Sorry, but I only have two hands, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!
10718 : Wow! Another present! Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?
10719 : Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent? You're starrrting to scare me, [mister/lady]...
10720 : I just accepted a gift from you, kind [sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.
10721 : ou've brought joy to the children of Vana'diel!
10722 : ou've brought barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel!
10723 : ##
10724 : Yo ho ho and a bottle of mulsum! I may be a pirate, but ye won't sees me plunderin' the hearts of the wee lads and lassies!
10725 : Here, ya scurvy dawg, takes this booty and pass her on to an innocent child. Arrrg, but if I hears ya kept it fer yer own lonesome, I'll personally sees ya walk the plank!
10726 : Arrrg, if ye wants t'bring joy to the tykes, ye have t'git yer grubby hands on some o' that joy. Fork over enough d'bloons t'yer pal One-eyed Atagei-Portagei, and ye can buys all the joy ye'll ever need!
10727 : What's this? Might it be maps of buried treasure? Hm? Letter from the kiddies? Arrrg, brings a tear t'me one good eye.
10728 : Do ye remember the name of the lassie that wrote this here %?
10729 : Who was it? Arukoko. Chomomo. Hororo. Komomo. Mimomo. Myumimi. Paruru. Pichichi. Purakoko. Shanruru.
10730 : Arrrg, are ye absolutely, positively sure that it was [Arukoko/Chomomo/Hororo/Komomo/Mimomo/Myumimi/Paruru/Pichichi/Purakoko/Shanruru], [Arukoko/Chomomo/Hororo/Komomo/Mimomo/Myumimi/Paruru/Pichichi/Purakoko/Shanruru], and [Arukoko/Chomomo/Hororo/Komomo/Mimomo/Myumimi/Paruru/Pichichi/Purakoko/Shanruru] that gave ye th'letters?
10731 : Well? Absolutely, positively! Wait a minute...
10732 : I wonders who could've written this %...

10734 : Arrrg, I can tells by the look on yer face that you'd like t'bring some joy of yer own t'the children. Here, take me hat.
10735 : Ye can always tell a pirate by lookin' at the dawg's hat; the kids can too!
10736 : Yo ho ho! Those wee children'd make fine pirates!
10737 : Recently, there's been a lot of strange characters running around Windurst...even more than usual! I just hope that none of them try to steal this special order I'm supposed to deliver, kupo!
10738 : You've come to pick up the order? Are you sure you're not one of those strange characters with the hats, kupo? Well, who am I to judge? Here you go, kupo!
10739 : Hm? Did I forget something...? ...No, you've got the whole order, kupo.
10740 : Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?
10741 : Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!
10742 : You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.
10743 : This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.
10744 : But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!
10745 : It's just not fair, kupo!
10746 : Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!
10747 : And that's why we need your help, kupo! Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?
10748 : There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!
10749 : For starters, why don't you try finding %, %, and %? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!
10750 : Great! A whole set, kupo! Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole. Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!
10751 : If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo! We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!
10752 : Wow! Another set! You don't know how much this means to us, kupo! Here, take this!
10753 : Have you seen the decorations? The Doll Festival has started, kupo!
10754 : I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.
10755 : Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.
10756 : Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well? We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!
10757 : It looks like you have all the members you need. Time for the festival to begin, kupo!
10758 : After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival. Here, you take one as well, kupo!
10759 : It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!
10760 : In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!
10761 : As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, resourcefulness, I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!
10762 : Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress. Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!
10763 : And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor. I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!
10764 : Kupo!? Something's not right... Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!
10765 : Kupo... I know I said this was a girl's festival, but you need at least one guy to play the emperor, kupo.
10766 : You obtain % and %!
10767 : You obtain %, %, and %!
10768 : You obtain %, %, %, and %!
10769 : You obtain 3 %, 3 %, 3 %, and 3 %!
10770 : Kupo? What happened to your ten-person party? You can't trick presents out of me, kupo!
10771 : Ooh, a shiny new adventurer! Join in the fun, kupo!
10772 : You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day. Try again tomorrow, kupo!
10773 : Hey! Your party has different members all of a sudden! Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!
10774 : Hey! Your party has lost touch with its feminine side! You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!
10775 : Hmm... You seem to have lost your male element. Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!
10776 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!
10777 : We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
10778 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders! Behold the wondrous %, kupo!
10779 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.
10780 : But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!
10781 : Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
10782 : The % will absorb a part of the villain's aura every time you attack, kupo.
10783 : Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!
10784 : By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor. They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!
10785 : Here's a new %. Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!
10786 : If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
10787 : Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!
10788 : I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy! Here's your reward, kupo!
10789 : With all the aura you've absorbed with the %, we've managed to create a new weapon. We'd like you to have it, kupo!
10790 : Festival time, kupo!!! We moogles have come up with a new game for you to enjoy called "Azimuth Circle"!
10791 : Azimuth Circle is played in pairs! First, find a partner and make a party, kupo!
10792 : After you've done that, try to find a certain checkpoint located in this town! There are many checkpoints, but only one right answer, kupo!
10793 : However...you can only check three points, kupo! But don't worry--once you've checked a point, you can look at it again any number of times!
10794 : At each location lies a compass that points in the direction of your partner's special checkpoint! The directions will be indicated from the viewpoint of your partner, kupo.
10795 : Find both of your special checkpoints and exchange the items you receive from them! Bring those items to us. We will give you a reward in exchange, kupo!
10796 : That's all there is to it, kupo! To participate, make a party of two and talk to a moogle!
10797 : That's all there is to it, kupo! Your partner seems to already be participating in the game. If you want to play together, ask your partner to cancel the current game and talk to a moogle again!
10798 : Will you participate in Azimuth Circle with your partner, kupo?
10799 : Play the game? Ready to go! I'll pass.
10800 : When both of you are ready, talk to a moogle! Then the game will begin, kupo!
10801 : If you decide you want to play, just come with a friend, kupo!
10802 : Our records indicate that you are presently signed up for Azimuth Circle somewhere else, kupo. Would you like to cancel your participation there?
10803 : Well, kupo? You want to stop playing Azimuth Circle?
10804 : Cancel participation in Azimuth Circle? Yes, freedom! I'll keep playing, thanks.
10805 : Your game has been cancelled. If you want to try again, speak to a moogle, kupo!
10806 : Wow, you found it! Enjoy your reward, kupo!
10807 : This isn't the item your partner found! We're still waiting on the item you got from your friend, kupo!
10808 : You must wait for your partner to finish, kupo! Would you like to cancel the current game instead?
10809 : We can only pass out one item to you each day, kupo!
10810 : The direction of your partner's checkpoint is [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast] as seen from your partner!
10811 : There is a compass here that points to the direction of your partner's checkpoint. The compass is pointing [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].
10812 : You see something lying on the ground!
10813 : You cannot check any more checkpoints.
10814 : Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!
10815 : We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!
10816 : Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!
10817 : But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!
10818 : If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho.
10819 : Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo! Just take care, and good luck, kupo!
10820 : It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!
10821 : We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!
10822 : We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?
10823 : Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!
10824 : There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.
10825 : You'll help us out, kupo?
10826 : Help the moogles? I'll give it a try. I have other things to do.
10827 : Oh, I just remembered! I think that the cards are all addressed to people who are wearing red...
10828 : Good luck!
10829 : If you change your mind, just let me know, kupo.
10830 : This card is addressed to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, kupo!
10831 : This card is addressed to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, kupo!
10832 : I've been waiting! I've got a present for you, kupo!
10833 : I have a request, too. I've got presents for all the other adventurers, too, but I can't find everyone. I need your help, kupo!
10834 : I need you to give this card to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, and have them bring it back to me, kupo!
10835 : Oh, and the person should be wearing the same red clothing you are!
10836 : I'll wait here and get the present ready! Thanks, kupo!
10837 : Did you hand out the % yet, kupo? If you forgot who to give it to, just bring it to a moogle and you'll get a reminder.
10838 : You forgot who to give the % to? Find a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s and hand it over, kupo!
10839 : You can only hand out one card a day, kupo!
10840 : Are you spreading joy to the children of Vana'diel? Hey, I can tell you something you should know!
10841 : Listen close, now! To make the children happy you must...give them presents! You should think hard about what to get them! You might say it's the thought that counts, but unfortunately, the children think otherwise!
10842 : You should also wear a red hat like the one I have on now! It'll prove you're a smilebringer, so the kids won't think you're a creep.
10843 : Where can you find a hat? Well, I saw someone selling them around here earlier. I'm sure you can find them if you look!
10844 : [You haven't brought any happiness to the children!/You've done some good./You have done fairly well./You have given the children much joy!/You have brought smile upon smile to the children!/You have the children bursting with glee!/The children love you!] [What a disappointment./You just need to give a little extra effort!/Keep it up!/You make a good smilebringer./Excellent work!/Stupendous job!/Even I think you're great!]
10845 : You can make good use of some of that joy you've brought to transport yourself to another nation. The children in other parts of Vana'diel need smiles, too!
10846 : Transport to another nation? Not now. Go to San d'Oria. Go to Bastok. Go to Windurst.
10847 : See ya!
10848 : Sorry, but it looks like you don't have enough joy and happiness in your life to do that. You can earn some by giving presents to children, though!

10862 : Hey! Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
10863 : Hello.
10864 : Hi!
10865 : Hey.
10866 : Hello!
10867 : At your service.
10868 : Hello.
10869 : Did you need something?
10870 : What do you need?
10871 : ...
10872 : What can I do for you?
10873 : What's up?
10874 : Anything I can do?
10875 : Was there something?
10876 : What do you need?
10877 : Is there something I can help you with?
10878 : Anything I can do to help?
10879 : What can I do for you?
10880 : What is it?
10881 : What do you say? Never mind. Let's chat. Tell me your level and combat style. Let's talk about combat signals. Let's talk about jobs. Let's talk about appearances. I need %.
10882 : I'll be going, then.
10883 : Okay, then. See ya!
10884 : Then I'll be leaving. See you around.
10885 : Very well. Until next we meet.
10886 : Then I'll see you later!
10887 : Sure. Don't hestitate to call me again.
10888 : Okay. Take care, then.
10889 : See you later, then.
10890 : Then I bid you farewell.
10891 : Oh? Bye, then!
10892 : Very well. Until next we meet.
10893 : Is that all? Then I'm leaving.
10894 : What do you talk about? Signals for low health. Signals for low magic. Signals for weapon skill usage. Other combat concerns.
10895 : Do you need to know? Yes, that would help. Not really.
10896 : Which do you recommend? Shield style. Attacker style. Healer style. Stalwart shield style. Fierce attacker style. Soothing healer style.
10897 : Time for a change? You betcha. It's fine how it is.
10898 : I was wondering if you'd seen that child we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis. Is she keeping out of trouble?
10899 : Is the little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis doing okay? Just wondering...
10900 : You remember that little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? I was just worried...ah, never mind.
10901 : Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? There's something that's been bothering me...
10902 : The girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis... Have you seen her since then? I'm just a little worried, that's all.
10903 : By the way, do you remember the young lady we saved in Eldieme Necropolis? Such a fragile little thing... I hope she's okay.
10904 : I wonder how the little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis is doing. I was just thinking about it.
10905 : So, have you seen the little girl we found crying in the Eldieme Necropolis lately? Just wondering how she was doing.
10906 : How is the young girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis doing? Hope she's staying out of trouble...
10907 : You remember that adorable little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis, don't you? I wonder if she's doing okay.
10908 : Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis lately? There's something that's been bothering me...
10909 : Do you remember the young girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? If you see her, tell her she shouldn't be wandering outside town alone.
10910 : I was thinking about that dragon we fought in Ghelsba. What was it even doing there? Does it have something to do with that mirror?
10911 : Do you remember the battle we fought with that dragon in Ghelsba? What on Vana'diel was a dragon doing there, anyway!?
10912 : About that dragon we fought in Ghelsba... Do you think the mirror was feeding it power?
10913 : There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba. Why was it there, I wonder...
10914 : Do you remember that terrible dragon we fought together in Ghelsba? It felt as though the power of the mirror had driven it into that frenzied state.
10915 : The encounter we had with the dragon in Ghelsba sure was a close call. I'm sure glad I showed up when I did.
10916 : Why was that dragon in Ghelsba? I hope it doesn't foreshadow something worse...
10917 : I wonder why that dragon we fought was in Ghelsba. Was it after the mirror, maybe?
10918 : Do you remember the dragon we fought in Ghelsba? It's strange that such a creature would be found there...
10919 : Are there usually dragons in Ghelsba? I mean, besides the one we fought...
10920 : There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba. Why was it there, I wonder...
10921 : The dragon we fought in Ghelsba does not belong there. I suspect a sinister hand behind its presence.

10970 : It might be distracting, but do you want me to talk during battle?
10971 : Do you want me to talk during battle?
10972 : I'm not that talkative, but do you want me to say what I'm doing during battle?
10973 : Would you prefer that we kept up communication during battle?
10974 : Do you want me to talk during battle?
10975 : Would it be better if I talked during battle?
10976 : Do you need me to say what I'm doing during battle?
10977 : Do you need me to say what I'm doing during battle?
10978 : Do you need me to say what I'm doing during battle?
10979 : Do you need me to say what I'm doing during battle?
10980 : Would you prefer that we kept up communication during battle?
10981 : Battle is no place for conversation, but if it serves to bolster teamwork...
10982 : Do you need to hear it? Yes, I do. Not so much.
10983 : Fair enough.
10984 : Got it!
10985 : No problem.
10986 : Understood.
10987 : Got it!
10988 : No problem!
10989 : Fine with me.
10990 : No problem!
10991 : Okay, then.
10992 : Okay, got it!
10993 : Understood.
10994 : Fine.
10995 : I haven't really thought much about jobs. What kind of combat style would be good, do you think?
10996 : Jobs? I'll try anything once. What style of combat do you recommend?
10997 : I'm not that interested in jobs. Give me a style of combat and I'll stick to that.
10998 : There are so many jobs to choose from. Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?
10999 : What combat style could I use that would be helpful to you?
11000 : Feel free to go ahead and choose my combat style. I don't mind.
11001 : I can fight in any style, no matter what my job is. Do you have any particular style you want me to use?
11002 : No matter the job, I can fight in any style! Is there a particular style you recommend?
11003 : Jobs? If the style of fighting is the same, the job doesn't matter much to me. What kind of combat style do you recommend?
11004 : I don't know much about jobs, but can you recommend a combat style for me?
11005 : There are so many jobs to choose from. Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?
11006 : You presume to have knowledge on how I should approach combat?
11007 : Hmm. I'll give it a shot.
11008 : Right! That's the style for me!
11009 : Hmm. I'll try it.
11010 : Okay. I'll try that next time I fight.
11011 : Okay then. I'll start doing that from next time.
11012 : Sounds good! Leave it to me!
11013 : Okay, I'll look forward to trying it.
11014 : Okay! Sounds like fun!
11015 : Really? Okay, I'll try it out.
11016 : Hmmm. Okay! I'll do my best!
11017 : Okay. I'll try that next time I fight.
11018 : Fine. I will try your suggested combat style.
11019 : What? You think I should change my headwear?
11020 : My headwear? You think it's time for a change?
11021 : You don't like my headwear?
11022 : Are you suggesting a change in headwear?
11023 : You want to choose new headwear for me?
11024 : You're interested in my headwear? Sure, I don't mind you coordinating my fashion.
11025 : What? Come on, out with it. You think I should change my headwear?
11026 : Huh!? You don't like my headwear? Should I wear something else?
11027 : Yes? You want me to change my headwear?
11028 : What are you staring at? Don't you like my headwear?
11029 : Are you suggesting a change in headwear?
11030 : My headwear collection accounts for all possible battle conditions. Pick one that will meet your needs.
11031 : Well, I guess I could wear something else.
11032 : Hmm, I suppose a change couldn't hurt.
11033 : I'll change it, then.
11034 : Very well. I'll find something new.
11035 : Thanks. I'll try this one.
11036 : Ooh, I like your style!
11037 : Okay, I'll change it for you.
11038 : Well, okay. A change is as good as a holiday!
11039 : I'll try something new, then.
11040 : Hmm. I'll see what I can come up with!
11041 : Very well. I'll find something new.
11042 : Well, well, it seems you have an eye for these things. I shall equip this from now on.
11043 : I'll forget you said anything, then.
11044 : Oh? Okay.
11045 : Well, that's a relief.
11046 : I'll stay the way I am, then.
11047 : So I don't need to change it? Fashion can be so frustrating...
11048 : You like me just the way I am, eh?
11049 : Well, that's good to hear.
11050 : Are you sure? Well, I guess that's a good thing...
11051 : Oh? Alright, then.
11052 : Phew! I thought you thought I looked funny or something!
11053 : I'll stay the way I am, then.
11054 : I own only the best gear, so I don't blame you for being indecisive.
11055 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11056 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11057 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11058 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11059 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11060 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11061 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11062 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11063 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11064 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11065 : You lost it? Here, take this.
11066 : You lost it? Hmph. Here, take this. But there'll be hell to pay if you misplace that one, too.
11067 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11068 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11069 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11070 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11071 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11072 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11073 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11074 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11075 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11076 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11077 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
11078 : I just gave you one! You are really trying my patience. Ask me again when I'm not so annoyed.
11079 : With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation. I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.
11080 : Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno? I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to Ru'Lude Gardens!
11081 : Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno? Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.
11082 : You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens. The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!
11083 : Wouldn't heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno? An architectural defect like that shouldn't be left unchecked...
11084 : Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what? And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...
11085 : Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping. You can't beat Bastok for jewelry, though.
11086 : Every time I come here I can't help but think that at least one person must've fallen off the edge...
11087 : Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant. Maybe I should go into the culinary business.
11088 : I wonder what kind of meals the archduke eats? Do archdukes eat curry...?
11089 : You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens. The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!
11090 : My adventurer's instinct tells me that a secret weapon sleeps here in Jeuno. Most likely the part that would form the main body...
11091 : Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete. A structure like the Chateau d'Oraguille must take centuries.
11092 : Chateau d'Oraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything! Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.
11093 : If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice. I think he has some kind of gambling problem...
11094 : Were you aware that the moat in moat carp refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?
11095 : Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all. At least military service isn't compulsory for them anymore.
11096 : A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didn't work out. I mean, where in Vana'diel am I supposed to find a slender Tarutaru beauty?
11097 : The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods. No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.
11098 : How embarrassing... I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!
11099 : Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes. Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.
11100 : Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right? What would happen if the waters rose too high...?
11101 : Were you aware that the moat in moat carp refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?
11102 : That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and-- A-ahem! Never mind...
11103 : Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?
11104 : Don't you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead? No...?
11105 : I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria. Bastok is a weird place...
11106 : I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother. He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...
11107 : How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers? I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.
11108 : I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...
11109 : I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.
11110 : I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...
11111 : I've never eaten a treant bulb before. What do they taste like?
11112 : Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok? What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?
11113 : I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother. He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...
11114 : The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...
11115 : In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor. I wonder if they ever change locations...
11116 : I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head. You should be careful!
11117 : Windurst truly is a magical nation. I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.
11118 : Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars. The property prices must be astronomical.
11119 : Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right? Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?
11120 : Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?
11121 : Windurst is famous for its hat shop. I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.
11122 : The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display. Are they not for sale?
11123 : The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild. I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.
11124 : There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst. What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods? It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...
11125 : Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars. The property prices must be astronomical.
11126 : A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.
11127 : When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...
11128 : I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos. I have my license, though. Really.
11129 : Hmm. I can't think of anything to talk about.
11130 : It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.
11131 : Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.
11132 : Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.
11133 : The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.
11134 : Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?
11135 : I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face. The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.
11136 : Are moogles considered to be beastmen? Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?
11137 : It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.
11138 : The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.
11139 : I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax. Does anything like that ever happen to you?
11140 : And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount? Maybe I'm being paranoid...
11141 : ... Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather. Not very interesting at all.
11142 : Do you notice the change? I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.
11143 : There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.
11144 : The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method. Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.
11145 : The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it! My best dress, ruined!
11146 : But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy. And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?
11147 : I like to be able to see what you're thinking.
11148 : I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...
11149 : Do you notice the change? I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.
11150 : Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and persuaded them to open shop.
11151 : No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...
11152 : I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.
11153 : I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.
11154 : Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?
11155 : I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.
11156 : I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?
11157 : Have you ever seen an aurora? It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.
11158 : I never know what to wear on windy days. I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?
11159 : I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around. What on Vana'diel do they use it for?
11160 : The smilebringers really exist, you know! They live somewhere far to the north!
11161 : Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?
11162 : In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.
11163 : I always thought it would look mysterious and unique. Maybe I just have no fashion sense...
11164 : For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that. Guess I bought too many vases...
11165 : Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go? Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...
11166 : You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.
11167 : But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.
11168 : Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?
11169 : I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it. You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...
11170 : Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...
11171 : Do they trade with people? I wonder what a beastman would buy...
11172 : They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria. You believe me, don't you, %?
11173 : You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.
11174 : But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate. After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.
11175 : You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor. I actually trade my old gear in all the time.
11176 : I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.
11177 : There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days. We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.
11178 : It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls. No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.
11179 : I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.
11180 : You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.
11181 : You really feel like chatting today, I see.
11182 : Do you eat out much?
11183 : I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.
11184 : What do you keep in your Mog House? Do you have furniture and stuff?
11185 : It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls. No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.
11186 : I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?
11187 : I have a friend in the business, you see. I'll introduce you sometime.
11188 : The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...
11189 : Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you. Why don't we train together?
11190 : I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.
11191 : To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?
11192 : M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question! It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!
11193 : Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!
11194 : Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food. Must be a metabolism thing...
11195 : I have as many as four different sets worked out... I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.
11196 : It's probably filled with flowerpots, right? Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!
11197 : I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.
11198 : What? You...journey with other adventurers...? N...not that it's any of my business, of course...
11199 : What do you say? Never mind. Let's chat. Let's talk about quests. Let's talk about battle. Let's talk about appearances. I need %.
11200 : What do you ask about? Quests we've taken together. Quests you're on now.
11201 : What do you ask about? I've changed my mind. Tell me your level and combat style. Combat signals. Combat styles. Weapons skills.
11202 : What do you ask about? I've changed my mind. Headwear. Fashionable equipment.
11203 : What should I wear? Your current headwear is fine. A leather bandana. An iron visor. A trader's chapeau. An iron mask. A mythril sallet. A tiger helm. A war beret. An austere hat. A wyvern helm. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. No headwear at all.

11215 : So, which do you think would suit me?
11216 : Fashionable equipment? Tell me what you think suits me!
11217 : So, what do you think would suit me?
11218 : I wonder what would suit me...
11219 : Is there something that'll suit me?
11220 : Ooh, you wanna coordinate my attire for me?
11221 : I think I look good in most things, but give me your honest opinion on which would suit me best.
11222 : Oh, so much to choose from! You pick for me!
11223 : So, what do you think would suit me?
11224 : Oh! Pick something that doesn't make me look fat!
11225 : I wonder which of these would suit me...
11226 : If you have an opinion, let's hear it.
11227 : What equipment looks best? I'm not really sure. Body. Hands. Legs. Feet. None.
11228 : Any other suggestions? None. Body. Hands. Legs. Feet.
11229 : I think you're right. I'll stick with this for a while.
11230 : I like your taste! I'll wear this for a while.
11231 : Hmm. Well, I guess this isn't too bad...
11232 : Well, then. I'll see that I wear this from now on.
11233 : This one? I think I like it! I'll wear it from now on.
11234 : Heheh, I had a feeling you'd pick this one. I've got a pile of spares, so there's no need to worry!
11235 : Oh? Not a bad choice. I'll wear this for a while, then.
11236 : Oh! That's my wardrobe sorted for a while!
11237 : If that's your choice, I'm happy to go with it for the time being.
11238 : Nice! I'll wear this from now on.
11239 : Well, then. I'll see that I wear this from now on.
11240 : Hm... Looks like your fashion sense is above average. I have no qualms about your selection.
11241 : This...?
11242 : Are you sure...?
11243 : ...
11244 : I see...
11245 : Uh-huh...?
11246 : This thing here...?
11247 : I suppose fashion is not your game...
11248 : This? Um...okay...
11249 : This...?
11250 : Really? Kinda boring, but okay...
11251 : I see...
11252 : Hmph... Remind me not to ask your opinion again.
11253 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
11254 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Do you wanna help me out?
11255 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
11256 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It appears to be a most complicated phenomenon.
11257 : Actually, I've been asked to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Can you help me out?
11258 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It's not exactly exciting, but can I rely on your help?
11259 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. How about helping me out?
11260 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Do you wanna come along?
11261 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
11262 : Actually, I've been asked to look into this Emptiness thing. Why don't you come along?
11263 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It appears to be a most complicated phenomenon.
11264 : Actually, I found a new assignment for you, to fill up your abundance of spare time. It's an investigation of the Emptiness.
11265 : I don't want to interrupt your other adventuring activities, so just come along when you're ready.
11266 : Any time is fine. Just show up and I'll be there. Try not to forget about it though, huh?
11267 : Maybe I'll run into you in Promyvion. See you there.
11268 : If I may, I would like to have your assistance in this matter. I have no strict timetable, so please come along when you are ready.
11269 : Any time is fine, so please help me! I...I'll be waiting for you in Promyvion. Please come quickly--that place gives me the creeps!
11270 : I'd appreciate your help whenever you can afford it.  Looking forward to seeing you in Promyvion!
11271 : Whenever you have free time is fine. I'll be waiting for you.
11272 : Anytime is fine. Just show up and I'll be there. Try not to forget about it though, huh?
11273 : You can show up whenever you have time. I'll even prepare a reward for you.
11274 : Come on, it'll be fun! I'll be there whenever you're ready.
11275 : If I may, I would like to have your assistance in this matter. I have no strict timetable, so please come along when you are ready.
11276 : Considering I was the one who accepted the assignment, it's only fair I accompany you. I will be waiting on location, so hurry up with your preparations.
11277 : Thanks for your help the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
11278 : I'm glad you were there the other day! Here, take this and call any time you need me.
11279 : Oh, I have something for you in return for your help the other day. Here.
11280 : Thank you for your assistance the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
11281 : Thank you so much for the other day. This isn't much, but it's just my way of showing my appreciation. Use it to call me anytime!
11282 : I really appreciate your help the other day. Everything worked out really well. If there's anything I can do in return, just use this to call me, okay?
11283 : Your help the other day was most appreciated. Take this, and use it to call me if you're ever in need.
11284 : Thanks a bunch for your help the other day! Use this to call me and I'll return the favor!
11285 : Thanks for your help the other day. Here, take this and call me anytime.
11286 : Thank you so much for your help the other day! Here, take this and call me if you're ever in trouble.
11287 : Thank you for your assistance the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
11288 : You did very well the other day. Here, this is your share of the reward for completing the assignment.
11289 : That % you're holding, is that about combat styles? Can I take a look?
11290 : Hey, is that % you're holding about combat styles? Can I take a look?
11291 : Is that % about combat styles? Let me borrow it for a bit.
11292 : Does that % you hold pertain to combat styles, by any chance? Might I take a look?
11293 : What's that? Hey, isn't that % about combat styles? Can I have a look?
11294 : How did you come by an unusual item like that? Wait a minute. That %...isn't it about combat styles? Mind if I sneak a peek?
11295 : Hm? Is that % you're holding about combat styles? Would you mind if I borrowed it?
11296 : Hey, is that % you're holding about combat styles? Don't be a hog, hand it over!
11297 : Would that % you're holding be about combat styles? Can I see it?
11298 : Hey, is that % about combat styles? Lemme see! Lemme see!
11299 : Does that % you hold pertain to combat styles, by any chance? Might I take a look?
11300 : Hm? How did you come to be in possession of that %? Go on, show it to me.
11301 : Hmm, that made a lot of sense. Let me know if you find any more of these.
11302 : That was pretty informative stuff. If you find any more manuals like that, let me know!
11303 : Hmm. There's a lot more to combat than I thought. Let me know if you find any more manuals like that.
11304 : A fascinating read. Please let me know if you happen to come across any similar works.
11305 : Wow, so much I never knew... If you have any more of these, please show them to me!
11306 : Nope, never seen this one before. Uh-huh... So you're supposed to do this, and then--ah, I got it! Be sure to let me know if you come across any others, okay?
11307 : Well, that cleared up a few things for me. Let me know if you find any similar books.
11308 : Wow! I never knew there was still so much to learn! If you find any more of these, you know where to bring them!
11309 : Hmm...interesting. I'd appreciate it if you brought me any more of these you happened to find.
11310 : Hmm... I think I understood most of it. Let me know if you find any more of these, okay?
11311 : A fascinating read. Please let me know if you happen to come across any similar works.
11312 : This is remarkable content indeed... I never knew such a combat style existed. Should you obtain any other such texts, bring them to me without delay.
11313 : Your adventuring fellow has learned a new combat style!
11314 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. Personally, I think it's better off broken...
11315 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. I bet something incredible will happen when we do...
11316 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. Luto has been blinded by her lust for treasure...
11317 : I wonder if the mirror can truly be repaired. Let us not waste any time gathering the information Luto mentioned.
11318 : So we're going to fix the mirror. I have a bad feeling about this...
11319 : If it's what you want to do, %, I'll help you fix the mirror.
11320 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. And what could this rare metal possibly be?
11321 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. It's kind of exciting!
11322 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. I just hope that nothing terrible happens...
11323 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. I'm a little scared, to be perfectly honest...
11324 : I wonder if the mirror can truly be repaired. Let us not waste any time gathering the information Luto mentioned.
11325 : So the fate of that mirror has fallen into our hands... First, we must seek the items Luto spoke of.
11326 : Let's get this full-course meal ready. We need %, %, %, %...
11327 : Let's get this full-course meal ready. We need %, %, %, %...
11328 : Let's get this full-course meal ready. We need %, %, %, %...

11338 : ...%, and %. Phew.

11572 : Could it have been the one that guy Umberto, or whatever, wanted?
11573 : Anyway, spill the facts, 'kay?
11574 : Oh my Goddess! Attacked by pirates? That's, like, so terrifically terrible!
11575 : And the painting was lost in all the, like, confusion and stuff, right?
11576 : And you came here under the request of some guy named Diederik to ask me to redo it?
11577 : And he's, like, bringing the fuddy-duddy an empty box instead?
11578 : Wow, that's, like, so bold! I wonder if he can pull it off!
11579 : Anyway, I totally understand your situation now. I'll redo the painting.
11580 : This is a test of my brilliance as a painter. I accept!
11581 : Now that I think about it, the original was total chocobo fodder anyway. I can, like, do so much better than that!
11582 : So he wanted me to paint his dead wife or something, yeah? Diederik gave me a portrait as a reference, but...
11583 : ...It's totally wrong! There's, like, no wifeliness in it at all!
11584 : This is sooo lame! There's, like, gotta be something else, you know?
11585 : Whoa, I just heard a sound, for real!
11586 : You can talk to your friend that way? That's uber-neato!
11587 : So did you get the lowdown on how I should paint my next masterpiece?
11588 : So he had this % thing as her memento? ...Oh, it's coming! I'm, like, getting an image!
11589 : Oh, ohhh... Quick, go to Korroloka Tunnel and get me that % so I can paint before I lose the image!
11590 : The %! This is the old man's memento of his wife, right?
11591 : Oh, ohhh... I'm getting something! I'm getting that hazily vague iiimaaage!
11592 : Hey, I've seen this before!
11593 : Yeah, it was totally in Bastok!
11594 : I used to be in Bastok, and all, and there was this lady who used to wear this % as, like, a pendant, or something.
11595 : She was a painter, and she used to paint pictures of her husband whenever they had a day off.
11596 : It was true marital bliss. Her man was an edgy little guy, but she was totally, like, laid-back and all. I think she soothed him.
11597 : Of course, her paintings lacked the energy and passion of my work, but they were pretty nice in a sedated kind of way, if you're into that kind of thing.
11598 : But she was, like, the bomb at using color!
11599 : I could just sit there all day and stare at her paints. They were right on!
11600 : What kind of color should I use for her? I just want to use one, but the color I use has to like, change intricately, delicately, depending on how you look at it, like the %...
11601 : ......!
11602 : Hold it right there! Could this be!? Oh my Goddess, this is perfect! The woman in the reference portrait and the woman in Bastok!
11603 : They're one and the same!? Could it be true?
11604 : You! %! Get your friend on the line, like, now!
11605 : I knew it! Angelica, you are a genius! Heehee!
11606 : Now my portrait will be absolute perfection!
11607 : Oh yeah, but like, as long as I've come this far, I might as well get the paints right and do her justice, you know?
11608 : I could swear she went into some castle swarming with Yagudo to get an % to use in mixing her paint, but I don't remember exactly where.
11609 : Anyway, go and get the %, 'kay? Hurry up, or I'll lose the image!
11610 : Ohhh, you really got the %! Awesome!
11611 : Actually...
11612 : Yeah, I heard. I don't, like, have to redo the painting anymore, right?
11613 : But I can, like, do so much better now! I could make a total Angelica masterpiece!
11614 : Just wait there a second! Don't budge! The passion is burning through my veins! Don't try to stop me!
11615 : Well, here it is! This is a totally fine piece of work, even for me!
11616 : Phew... I guess this'll make even more Angelica fans. It should be, like, a crime to be this brilliant!
11617 : Well, get out there and deliver it now! Like, on with you!
11618 : It's about time you brought my painting! Show it to me!
11619 : Oh, but what's the hurry? I've just arrived. Don't you want to sit back and relax a spell first? Take a deep breath, stretch out, maybe grab a few sips of tea...
11620 : I don't know what kinda inane ideas they're feeding you young'uns today, but when I order a painting, I expect it to come on time, not three days late!
11621 : Or maybe you just don't have it! If that's the case...just let me crack my knuckles first...
11622 : Okay! Okay! Here, I'll give it to you, so calm down. It goes without saying that you'll take good care of it, right?
11623 : Yeah, whatever. Hurry up and give it to me! Young'uns nowadays. No respect.
11624 : Eh? This is pretty secure packaging... I can't open this, you hear me!?
11625 : Oh, no no no no no! You mustn't move with such vigor! How about we take a nice, deep breath first, and then talk about it, okay?
11626 : You mean to tell me the paint isn't dry yet?
11627 : After you make me wait three days, you deliver me an unfinished product! You little...! What, you think we old people just sit around knitting, hoping you'll make time for us someday!?
11628 : Mister, I assure you, this painting is a delicate masterpiece. It would be a catastrophe to disturb it before it has fully dried! The humidity and temperature must be just right to ensure maximum quality!

11637 : This artist looks like an adventurer? Ha, you've got to be kidding me! I mean, if you look just so, my friend here could possibly look like an actual...that is, you shouldn't judge by appearances!
11638 : Anyway, our expert here says that opening the box now would have a negative effect on the painting.

11654 : You wouldn't want your hastiness ruining this beautiful painting, would you?
11655 : Well, I guess I've got no choice now, do I? Since I've already waited three days, I guess I can wait a mite longer. I'll let it go this time. But don't think you're getting off scot-free.
11656 : Until this thing dries, you're gonna help me out.
11657 : The other day, I lost my %. It's a memento of my deceased wife, you see.
11658 : You are gonna go look for another one. You wouldn't turn down a kind old man now, would you!?
11659 : Oh, come on!
11660 : First you make me wait in agony, and then you won't even listen to a single plea for the memory of my poor dead wife! What kind of a monster are you? I don't do business with monsters!
11661 : W-wait! You really think we wouldn't do a favor or two for a valued customer such as yourself? How could he think you wouldn't help him, [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]?

11677 : Yeah yeah, shaddup. Just go!
11678 : All right! We really pulled the wool over his eyes. Step one, clear!
11679 : Even he wouldn't dare open that box after all we ground him about it!
11680 : Now all we can do is hope that your friend is doing as well with Angelica...
11681 : What's that noise?
11682 : You can communicate with your partner through that? This is fantastic! So, how are things coming along in Windurst?
11683 : She'll redo the painting!? Terrific! Quite a friend you've got there, I'd say! Well, we'll just have to do our best to earn time now!
11684 : I just wish that old man didn't ask for something so bizarre.
11685 : He wanted a %, right?
11686 : I used to stock them a while back. My supplier said he got them in Korroloka Tunnel.
11687 : I hate to say it, but I've got an appointment awaiting me in Selbina.
11688 : So I'll just leave the search to you!
11689 : Hey hey, don't look at me that way, now. You're the only one I can count on! Please find the % for me!
11690 : Th-this is...! You really found the %!
11691 : I'm so happy. I've waited so long for this moment!
11692 : The painting I ordered is actually a portrait of my poor, departed wife.
11693 : She was a fine lass, she was. Much too fine for a man like me.
11694 : Long ago, I gave her the % that you found for me.
11695 : Those times are long gone, but she and I used to go to the beach and hunt for % together.
11696 : I gave a pretty one to her without much thought, simply 'cause I thought it looked nice. But she was so happy, she made it into a pendant, saying she wanted to keep it forever.
11697 : She wore it every day until she died...
11698 : I kept thinking I wanted to get her a nicer present, but she insisted that the % was the perfect gift.
11699 : It was the first and the last present I ever gave her.
11700 : My wife was an artist. She loved painting so much, she brought her canvas everywhere with her.
11701 : She often used me as the model for her works. I was embarrassed and kept trying to refuse, but she was persistent.
11702 : She always put a lot of emphasis on color. She used to travel the world looking for proper paints.
11703 : The shade she was most proud of recreating was the color that the % was that I gave her. Colors change with varying degrees of light, you know, and can be difficult to reproduce.
11704 : She treasured her secret recipe greatly.
11705 : It's amazing how a home can become so lonely with the loss of a single person.
11706 : Before my memories start to fade, I want to bring together all I remember about my wife.
11707 : That's why I ordered her portrait.
11708 : Ah, I've said too much.
11709 : Could you...leave me alone for a bit?
11710 : You actually got that crank to talk to you? It sounds like he really loved his wife.
11711 : Now I definitely can't tell him I lost his portrait! I wonder how the redo is coming along...
11712 : Hm, looks like it'll take some time, eh? Well, that's too bad.
11713 : I just got a message from Selbina, and I've got to go back to deal with an important matter.
11714 : It's probably best if you just leave the old man alone for a while.
11715 : Anyway, I'll be on my way now. Meet me in Selbina when you're done here.
11716 : Hrm. A tome that contains references to a mirror made from black-tinted metal...?
11717 : And a method for repairing said mirror...?
11718 : Hrm. Hrmmm... Hrrrmmmmmm...hrm!
11719 : I've had a look at the shelves, but there are so many books back there, I wouldn't know where to start...
11720 : I've had a look at the shelves, but there are so many books back there, I wouldn't know where to start...
11721 : I've had a look at the shelves, but there are so many books back there, I wouldn't know where to start...

11728 : I've had a look at the shelves, but I've never seen so many books before...
11729 : I've perused the shelves, but there are so many books back there, I wouldn't know where to begin...
11730 : I've had a look at the shelves, but there are so many books back there, I wouldn't know where to start...
11731 : Hrm? Hrrrrrm! That's it!
11732 : The volume that Ritopopo was searching for was all aboutaru mirrors. I'm certain there was some mention of Near Eastern treasure-weasures...
11733 : Hoho! I've found it! The elusive Looking Glass Legends!
11734 : Mostaru of these accounts appear to be no more than fairy tales, but there could be a kernel of truth hidden here and there...
11735 : My scholar-sense is tingling! Twenty years of research experience gives you almostaru supernatural powers, I do believe!
11736 : Now that my searching is done, I think I've earned a rest and a decentaru meal.
11737 : Even super-duper scholars such as myself need to eat something substantial every now and again. All those bretzels...really made me thirsty...
11738 : Now, what kind of sumptuous banquet shall I feastaru upon?
11739 : Hm? Can I aid you in some way?
11740 : Good gracious! Those Near Eastern mirrors actually existaru!? Then my research hasn't been in vainy-wain!
11741 : Eh?
11742 : You want to borrow the Looking Glass Legends?
11743 : You mustaru be joking. Give up this wonderful tome after I've only just discovered it?
11744 : <Rumble...rumble...>
11745 : Ah...!
11746 : You didn'taru hear anything just now! All you need to hear is me refusing to lend you my precious book!
11747 : <Rumble...rumble...>
11748 : ...
11749 : <Rumble...gurgle...rumble...>
11750 : You know... I've always wanted to give the minister something nice.
11751 : But I'm justaru too shy to present it myself...
11752 : <Gurgle...rumble...gurgle...>
11753 : ...
11754 : I overheard the minister mumble-wumbling something about craving a full-course meal...
11755 : It started with something like, I don'taru know, say %, %, %, and %...
11756 : Then came %, and % to finish.
11757 : I'm positive he would absolutaruly adore a meal like that.
11758 : Since I feel so indebted to the minister for assistaruing me in my research, I would do anything to grant his wish.
11759 : However, a scholar like myself has no place in the kitchen...
11760 : If you could see your way to preparing this gourmet delightaru, I would consider lending you the Looking Glass Legends.
11761 : But only if everything is absolutaruly perfect! I will accept nothing less! Oh, and you don'taru have to say the dinner is from me.
11762 : Simply hand it over and enjoy the joy you bring!
11763 : Did you remember everything, %?
11764 : Did you get everything, %?
11765 : Did you remember everything, %?
11766 : Did you memorize that list, %?
11767 : Did you remember all that, %?
11768 : Did you catch all that...?
11769 : Did you remember everything, %?
11770 : Did you get everything, %?
11771 : Did you remember everything, %?
11772 : Did you remember everything, %? I did. I think.
11773 : Did you memorize that list, %?
11774 : Do you have that list memorized?
11775 : %, %, %, and %. Followed by %...
11776 : %, %, %, and %. Followed by %...
11777 : %, %, %, and %. Followed by %...
11778 : %, %, %, and %. Followed by %...

11799 : Quite a spread.
11800 : That's quite a spread!
11801 : Quite a spread.
11802 : Quite the banquet, wouldn't you say?
11803 : All that for one person...?
11804 : That's enough food for a small banquet.
11805 : Quite a spread.
11806 : That's quite a spread!
11807 : Quite a spread.
11808 : Hmm... I'm starting to feel a little hungry myself...
11809 : Quite the banquet, wouldn't you say?
11810 : Full-course meal is clearly an understatement.
11811 : I don't really buy the story about it being for the minister, though.
11812 : I don't really buy the story about it being for the minister, though.
11813 : I don't really buy the story about it being for the minister, though.

11819 : I don't really buy the story about it being for the minister, though.
11820 : But why make this for the minister? She seemed to be absolutaruly starving!
11821 : The story about it being for the minister is rather hard to believe, though.
11822 : I find the story about it being for the minister rather hard to swallow.
11823 : Oh well, as long as we get our hands on that book.
11824 : Oh well, as long as we get our hands on that book.
11825 : Oh well, as long as we get our hands on that book.

11833 : No matter, as long as we acquire the book.
11834 : But it doesn't concern us, as long as we get that book.
11835 : Hrmmmmm? Where did all this food come from...!?
11836 : Ooh!
11837 : <Rumble...gurgle...rumble...gurgle...>
11838 : Fantastic! Magnifico! This is exactaruly what I've been dreaming about!
11839 : I'm so happy! I thank you from the bottom of my stomach!
11840 : Here! Take the book! I finished reading it while you were preparing that splendiferous full-course meal.
11841 : It truly was a fascinating read.
11842 : This Taliesin is amazing! I hope that one day I can pen an equally marvelous research paper.
11843 : My next goal is to read The Lost Looking Glass! Did you know there were two magical mirrors from the Near East?
11844 : Researchers on the subject think that these two looking glasses may be fundamental opposites. One a mirror of the other, you might say!
11845 : Looking Glass Legends touches upon the object known as the Mirror of Blighted Gloom.
11846 : The Lost Looking Glass details the mirror called the Glass of Blessed Radiance.
11847 : I mustaru seek out The Lost Looking Glass and straighten out the facts once and for all! My scholarly spirit is reignited!
11848 : Thank you once again! Goodbye!
11849 : Hrmmmm.... Such a dramatic change in character... Food can have such a powerful effectaru on people.
11850 : Hrmm... I'm the minister of this place, or had you forgotten? I demand a little respectaru...

11888 : <Rumble...gurgle...rumble...>
11889 : Hey, like, are you still running around on adventures with your friend?
11890 : A little curiosity never killed anyone, you know?
11891 : Anyway, I'm working soooooo hard on this painting! So make like a tree, and get out of here, 'kay?
11892 : Zzz... <mumble mumble>... ...Huh!?
11893 : Hey, I've been looking everywhere for you!
11894 : You adventurer folk can'taru seem to sit still. Can you imagine what it's like trying to find you? ...The nerve of people nowadays...
11895 : Well, I haven't exactly been out searching for you...not in the strict technical sense of the word...but you've had me so worked-perked up, I haven't been able to properly meditate!
11896 : You've heard of the prime avatar that inhabits the realm of dreams, right? Wipe that innocent look off your face! I know you know better!
11897 : I have received a summons for you from that prime avatar. Yes, you! And also for your buddy-wuddies.
11898 : These past few days have been a nightarumare. Literally! The prime avatar snatchy-watched me up in my dreams, and I thought I was a goner. Scenes of Windurst flashed before my eyes!
11899 : But all he said was, Come to Pso'Xja, and ordered me to relay the message to you and your palsy-walsies. Do you see what I went through all because of you!?
11900 : But an-y-way!
11901 : I've told you, and done my job! So get your tailsy-wailsy down to Pso'Xja like Mr. Prime Avatar said!
11902 : I'll never be able to meditate properly again if you don't! So off with you now! Shoo!
11903 : Welcome back. I'm glad you're still alive. I saw the battle in my meditative state.
11904 : The prime avatar in my dream handed this to me afterwards and told me to give it to you.
11905 : Diabolos...the power of dreams...
11906 : The power to change...dreams into reality...to make abstraction...tangible...
11907 : We terrestrial avatars...will watch over Vana'diel...for eternity...
11908 : Please use our power...for the good of Vana'diel...
11909 : Prime avatar Diabolos! I've heard that name in a text somewhere!
11910 : Ahem...<mumble mumble>... I'm going to meditate now and search my memories! So scram and let me concentrate!
11911 : What? You want to challenge Diabolos again?
11912 : You just love trouble, don't you? I'm going to meditate now, and I'll let you know as soon as I find Diabolos.
11913 : Actually, a master meditator like me should be able to find him in no time at all, so I'd go straightaru to Pso'Xja now if I were you!
11914 : Good night! <Mumble mumble>...mmm...zzz...
11915 : Welcome back. I'm glad you're still alive. I saw the battle in my meditative state.
11916 : The ruler of dreams gave me this again...
11917 : Well, I'm off to meditate again!
11918 : What do you want? You want to find Diabolos and get him to keep his word?
11919 : Why, that's easy as melon pie. I see him all the time! All you have to do is snoop around and act like you're trying to find out about him, and he'll be right there!
11920 : Maybe even terrestrial avatars have events in their past they don't want anyone to know about!
11921 : What do you desire? %. %. %. %. Gil. A pact with Diabolos.
11922 : This is your choice?
11923 : You want %? Yes. Wait!
11924 : Gil is what you truly want? Yes. Wait!
11925 : Are you sure? Yes. Wait!
11926 : Fight again? Let me at him! Not yet.
11927 : Mmm...hmmm... Pso'Xja...zzz...
11928 : You are now able to summon Diabolos!
11929 : Love is in the air! It's time for Valentione's Day celebrations, kupo!
11930 : There is an amazing type of chocolate whose filling is influenced by your feelings! When chocolate halves from a boy and a girl are matched together, the resulting whole produces a wonderful taste if the couple is meant to be, kupo!
11931 : Young men and women in this town have broken their chocolates in two, hoping to meet that special someone!
11932 : We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!
11933 : Here's what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.
11934 : There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!
11935 : When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.
11936 : You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.
11937 : Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.
11938 : When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.
11939 : If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!
11940 : Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo.
11941 : We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!
11942 : Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!
11943 : After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!
11944 : While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho!
11945 : Or maybe you could take advantage of this romantic occasion and make a party with that special someone while you exchange chocolates, kupopopo!
11946 : Want to try again? Match up all the lovebirds you can, kupo!
11947 : Something wrong, kupo?
11948 : Something wrong? Listen to the rules again. Give up. Not really.
11949 : Four people hold the chocolates you seek. Make them into four whole chocolates and give one to each person. When you're finished, return to a moogle, kupo!
11950 : You aren't planning on giving up, are you?
11951 : Quit the game? Yes. Not yet.
11952 : If you want to start over, you'll have to get rid of the chocolates you have now.
11953 : Really give up? Yes! No, not yet!
11954 : Just think of all those poor singles! You'll come back and help them later, won't you, kupo? You should get rid of your chocolates in a subtle manner, so that you don't hurt anyone's feelings! ...We wouldn't want you getting a stomachache either, now would we, kupo?
11955 : You've managed to gather complementary pieces of chocolate! Wait just a moment, now...
11956 : ...
11957 : Kupopopo! What a beautiful piece of chocolate! No need to thank me, now. Hurry and give it to the Valentione Single!
11958 : Great work, kupo! You delivered chocolates to everyone! I've been getting lots of feedback about it! The response has been...
11959 : Excellent! I thought my heart was going to flutter out of my furry little chest--you score # [point/points]! The power of love is amazing, kupo!
11960 : Decent. You score # [point/points]. Everyone seems relatively happy! Not bad, kupo.
11961 : Well, let's just say that some things just weren't meant to be. You score # [point/points]. Sorry, but I won't hand out a reward this time, kupo.
11962 : My bag is filled with goodies for helpful adventurers like yourself! Take your pick!
11963 : Which item would you like? Let me think. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
11964 : Are you absolutely sure, kupo?
11965 : You really want %? Yes, that's the one! On second thought...
11966 : You must wait a bit longer to try again, kupo.
11967 : You have to throw away all of your chocolates before playing again, kupo! It might seem a waste, but a rule is a rule!
11968 : Oh, I've been waiting for this moment! You'll help me find my perfect woman, right? Wow, thank you!!!
11969 : I really like [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! They're fantastic! Here's a piece of chocolate. I hope you bring back the best chocolate ever! Good luck!
11970 : You still haven't brought any chocolate? I've been waiting so long for this, so hurry up!
11971 : Hey, what do you want? You could go see a moogle or something!
11972 : <gasp>! Y-you brought me a chocolate! I'm going to savor its delicate flavor...and then I'll let you know what I think! Thank you!
11973 : Hey. I heard you're playing the matchmaker around here.
11974 : Hmph, guess I might as well let you know my type. I like [Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra], and I like 'em [cheerful/kind/shy/modest]. I leave this chocolate, and my future, in your hands. Well, go on. Get on with it.
11975 : What? Still...? Oh well, keep it up. Looking forward to the results.
11976 : What do you want? I don't think I know you.
11977 : Well, you were able to get a finished chocolate after all. I need some time to think, though. After all, this could determine my future, so I will taste it later. Thank you.
11978 : I have been waiting all my life for this! You'll match me up with a girl, right? Wow! Me and a girl, together! Imagine!
11979 : Oh, oh, let's see...I'll tell you exactly what I want! I want a [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! She also must cook things like steamed catfish every night, love watching Ballista, and have an interest in airship mechanics...er, ignore those last few requests. Anyway, here's some chocolate! Go get me a woman!
11980 : Oh wow, thanks for doing this for me! I can't wait for my chocolate!
11981 : What? What do you need? Nothing? Okay, then!
11982 : Wooow, you really got a chocolate for me! I'll let you know how it tastes later! Oh, thank you, thank you! I hope you can get a real, live [girlfriend/boyfriend] someday, too!
11983 : N-no way! I can meet...a woman? One that...likes me!? ...Oh, wow!
11984 : Okay, okay...I'm going to tell you my type. Let's see...I'd like an, um...ack, this is so embarrassing. I'd like a [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! Y-yes, that's my order! (Oops...maybe I went too far just now...) Anyway, h-here's a chocolate!
11985 : Ahhh! By Altana, you scared me! Not finished yet? O-oh, I'm sorry!
11986 : What!? ...Oh, you want something? I-I'm fine!
11987 : Ahhh! You really got a chocolate for me! B-but, I don't see anywhere I could eat it now! I'll have to tell the moogle what I think later. Wow, this is great! See ya!
11988 : Hiya! I've been waiting for you, sugar! Going to find a real sweetheart for me, are you? Yay!
11989 : Listen closely, now! I liiike...[cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boys! Teeheehee! Here's a chocolate! Doesn't it look yummy? Good luck!
11990 : What's wrong, pumpernickel? Not having trouble, are we? I really want a man, so please hurry up!
11991 : Hm? Want something? You should go talk to a moogle!
11992 : Oh, I've been waiting! I wonder what it tastes like! I'll let you know what I think later. Thank you so much!
11993 : Why, hello! This looks like quite an exciting event, doesn't it? I hope I can also meet a nice guy.
11994 : [Cheerful/Cool-headed/Honest/Shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] guys are just my type. Here's a chocolate. You have my support! I wish you the best of luck!
11995 : Hello! You seem to be working very hard. I'm really thankful! But you needn't rush around so fast. Take your time! I can wait if it makes the job easier for you!
11996 : Yes? You have a question? Oh, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong person, but don't worry about it!
11997 : Wow, you brought back a finished chocolate! Thank you so much! I wonder what it tastes like. Teeheehee, I can't wait to try it. I hope you meet someone special, too!
11998 : Aaah! Oh...hi! Um, today is...and I...well, that is... <sigh> I can't bring myself to say it!
11999 : Well, here goes nothing. I want [a cheerful/a cool-headed/an honest/a shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boyfriend! A-and here's a chocolate... Th-thank you! (I can't believe I just said that!)
12000 : Eep! Oh, y-you haven't brought a chocolate back yet? You really scared me, you know! Anyway, good luck!
12001 : Y-yes? What is it? I...um, I don't need anything...
12002 : What? Th-this...could it be? You got me a chocolate! I can't eat it here, though...that would be sooo embarrassing. But I will eat it later, so thank you!
12003 : Hello... I may not look like much, but I do hope to meet a nice guy...
12004 : I really like [cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] men. Please take this chocolate. It may not be the best in the world, but I hope you can use it to find someone.
12005 : You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you? I knew it would be hard to find someone for a girl like me...
12006 : What's the matter? I don't think there's anything I need...
12007 : I see you got a chocolate for me. I can't tell how good it will be until I taste it, but maybe there's hope for me after all. Thanks so much for helping me.
12008 : Come and celebrate the Doll Festival with us, kupo!
12009 : We've got items for everyone! Here you go, kupo!
12010 : Come again and bring your friends! Each of them will also get an item, kupo!
12011 : You can get items only once each day, so come back again tomorrow, kupo!
12012 : You obtain # ), # ), # ), and # )!
12013 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!
12014 : The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
12015 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans! Behold the wondrous %, kupo!
12016 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
12017 : But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!
12018 : Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
12019 : If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
12020 : Kupopo! The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!
12021 : And this time, it's called Azimuth Circle...II!
12022 : Would you like to know more, kupo?
12023 : Want to know more? Fill me in! I'm okay for now, kupo.
12024 : To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.
12025 : So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!
12026 : Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!
12027 : We've set up several checkpoints outside.
12028 : The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!
12029 : What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!
12030 : And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!
12031 : Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.
12032 : But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!
12033 : And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.
12034 : So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!
12035 : Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!
12036 : That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!
12037 : You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!
12038 : Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!
12039 : Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?
12040 : Is this partner okay with you? Perfect! I want to go with someone else...
12041 : Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!
12042 : Kupo? Where'd your partner go?
12043 : I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!
12044 : I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.
12045 : Kupopo! Congratulations! You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...
12046 : Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!
12047 : We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?
12048 : Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.
12049 : It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.
12050 : Are you ready now, kupo?
12051 : Leave town? Send me out! Not yet...
12052 : Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!
12053 : Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.
12054 : If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!
12055 : I can only give each person one item a day!
12056 : Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!
12057 : Kupo? You already have %...
12058 : Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!
12059 : The moogle hands % a small compass made from scintillant ore.
12060 : If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo!
12061 : What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!
12062 : Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...
12063 : Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...
12064 : Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...
12065 : % returns the compass to the moogle.
12066 : You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.
12067 : What is it? Do you want to start over?
12068 : Start over? Yes, please. No thanks.
12069 : You there. I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of ghosts?
12070 : Have you heard? Ghosts!? Yes, I've heard.
12071 : Then we may move on to more important matters.
12072 : Would you be willing to aid me in exorcising these spirits?
12073 : <Sigh>... Allow me to explain. I am an exorcist--a banisher of spirits.
12074 : I have traveled here at the behest of a certain personage from this nation who is well aware of my skill in such matters.
12075 : The request is fairly routine--I am to banish the spirits that have suddenly appeared within the town. But there is a problem...
12076 : These ghosts are not simple apparitions.
12077 : When they yet lived, they belonged to a witch coven known as the Dark Lilies.
12078 : And they use the language of spirits--the Cursed Tongue. It is not a language I am familiar with.
12079 : The art of the exorcist involves learning the mind of the spirit in order to bring it under control. I am at the point of capitulation.
12080 : That is why I am calling on adventurers to aid me.
12081 : I want you to disguise yourself as a monster, and try to eavesdrop on the spirit's mumblings.
12082 : Once I learn of these ravings, I will be able to carry out my role as an exorcist.
12083 : Will you help? Of course. Not a ghost of a chance.
12084 : Ahaha... How droll. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
12085 : Most excellent. There is one thing you must be aware of, however.
12086 : These spirits were once people such as you and I. If they see you directly, there is a good chance they will see through your disguise.
12087 : If, by chance, your disguise fails you, simply assume a monstrous form once again and continue your pursuit.
12088 : I am aware of two spirits that haunt this town.
12089 : The one known as Guwanana is the most alert and suspicious, so I will ask you to first track down the Mithran spirit by the name of Bikho Ronpotteh.
12090 : Once you have a clear idea of why the ghost has appeared here, I want you to report your findings to me immediately.
12091 : Good luck.
12092 : Is that the glow of success I see upon your face? What of the spirit...?
12093 : I see... So that is her purpose...
12094 : The tale is tragic, but this world is no longer meant for one such as she.
12095 : I will prepare for the exorcism.
12096 : You have been a great help. Please take this as a token of my appreciation.
12097 : This is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities. Enjoy yourself, and forget about this sorrowful affair.
12098 : However, should you wish to aid in another exorcism, I would welcome your help.
12099 : What has befallen you? Do you wish to give up?
12100 : Give up? I'm done. Not yet.
12101 : A pity. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
12102 : Then please return to your pursuit of the spirits.
12103 : Ah, you're back! Perhaps you have enough experience now to stalk the more alert ghost of the two.
12104 : Will you consent to aid me again?
12105 : The second spirit is called Guwanana. She is well aware of her surroundings, so I urge the utmost care when following her.
12106 : Good day! I suppose you've heard of all the ghost sightings around town?
12107 : I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.
12108 : I'll get straight to the point. Do you want to help in an exorcism?
12109 : Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess. Let me give you the short version:
12110 : I'm a stranger to this land, called in by one of those important types.
12111 : For what? I happen to have a certain level of fame as an exorcist. You know--a banisher of spirits.
12112 : But these spirits are proving to be a bit of a handful.
12113 : They were powerful witches in life and used to belong to some famous coven.
12114 : The worst thing is, they use some beastly language known as the Cursed Tongue. That's not a language I can understand.
12115 : That's a problem because, as an exorcist, I need to learn what's in their hearts and minds. Then I can find a weakness.
12116 : That's where you come in...
12117 : I need you to disguise yourself as a monster and get close enough to find out what they're thinking.
12118 : Once I know some details, I can begin the exorcism and rid this town of its unwelcome guests.
12119 : What do you say? Will you help?
12120 : Oh... Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
12121 : Thank you! There is one thing you should know...
12122 : These ghosts are a little vague, but they were once people too. If they get a good look at you, they'll know you're just wearing a costume...
12123 : But don't give up if they catch on to you. Just put the disguise back on and try again.
12124 : I've located two spirits floating around this town.
12125 : The first one, Pretty Heart, is fairly sharp. I suggest you go after Selma, the second spirit, to get your feet wet.
12126 : Once you've figured out why the ghost is here, you need to tell me about it right away.
12127 : Good luck!
12128 : Oho, looks like you've managed to learn something...
12129 : Hmmm... So that's why...
12130 : It might seem cruel, but that ghost no longer belongs here. The exorcism is for their sake as much as ours...
12131 : It's time to begin my preparation.
12132 : Oh, and this is for you.
12133 : It's a witch hat. The design matches those worn by the coven I mentioned. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.
12134 : If you want to try your hand at ghost-chasing again, I'll be right here.
12135 : Giving up the ghost?
12136 : Oh... Well, ghosts aren't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
12137 : Then it's back to chasing spirits with you!
12138 : You know what? I think you could probably track that other ghost now that you have some experience.
12139 : What do you think?
12140 : Your target's name is Pretty Heart. Wonder why he's called that...
12141 : Really? I'm pretty sure you've got it in you...
12142 : Hi, I'm Gertrude. I came to investigate the rumors of ghosts haunting this town. Have you heard anything?
12143 : You have? Well, that makes my job easier, then.
12144 : Do you think you could help out a struggling exorcist?
12145 : No? Then let me fill you in on the details.
12146 : I may not appear as such, but I'm actually an exorcist from a land far to the west.
12147 : A certain personage from this nation summoned me to banish the spirits plaguing the city.
12148 : But once I arrived, I discovered these ghosts were not your average apparitions.
12149 : In life, they were fearsome witches and wielded destructive spells of tremendous power.
12150 : Their strength has followed them into the afterlife, giving them a high level of resistance to my exorcisms.
12151 : In this sort of case, I would usually find some clue from their former lives in order to empower my rituals.
12152 : The problem is, these spirits speak the Cursed Tongue, and I can't understand enough of that language to learn anything.
12153 : And so, I'm forced to call upon adventurers to aid me.
12154 : Would you be willing to disguise yourself as a monster and try to discover what drives these beings?
12155 : Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard. Please come back if you change your mind.
12156 : Wonderful. There is one thing I must warn you of, however.
12157 : These witches were once people, and are clever enough to see through your disguise should you be too careless.
12158 : If they do happen to find you out, please don't give up. They will soon forget, and you can don your costume once again.
12159 : According to my sources, there are two ghosts in this area.
12160 : The one called Maryse is extremely vigilant and aware of her surroundings. I suggest you try following Poseaulloie first to get some practice.
12161 : Once you've discovered the ghost's reason for remaining in this world, please inform me at once. There are many preparations to be made.
12162 : Good luck!
12163 : How did you fare...?
12164 : I see, so that's why she...
12165 : However, it is my duty to give her that little push she needs to leave this world behind.
12166 : I will begin preparing for the exorcism.
12167 : Your help has been invaluable. Would you accept this in appreciation?
12168 : It's a witch hat. Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...
12169 : If you have time, I would gladly accept your help again.
12170 : What's wrong? Have you grown tired of your task?
12171 : Oh, I see... Well, please return to me if you find your patience for this task restored.
12172 : Then I would ask you to return to your task. Good luck.
12173 : Would you consider an attempt at following the more wily of the two spirits?
12174 : I'm sure you have sufficient experience now.
12175 : Then your next target is the one known as Maryse. Please be careful...
12176 : You must recover your strength before you continue pursuing these supernatural intruders. Return to me once you have had time to rest.
12177 : I appreciate the offer of help, but you're in no state to be chasing ghosts. Build your strength, rest your mind, and return to me when you're ready.
12178 : I'm happy to have someone so cooperative on my side, but too much contact with spirits will drain your strength. Return to me on the morrow when you've had time to rest.
12179 : !!! You...you're no monster!
12180 : !!! You...you're no monster!
12181 : !!! You...you're no monster!
12182 : !!! You...you're no monster!
12183 : So pretty...the fountain is still so...
12184 : That must be...the chateau... And over there...the cathedral...
12185 : I never thought...to return here...
12186 : Every morning...I watched him training...from afar... If only...I had had the courage...
12187 : No...he was a Hume... I...am a witch... If I were...to confess...
12188 : And then...there was the lunch...he always carried... Someone...must have made it...for him...
12189 : He passed...without ever knowing... But I...am still here...
12190 : I... I should no longer care... I want to forget...
12191 : The fountain where he took his rest... The stones that grew wet with his tears... Nothing has changed...except me...
12192 : The moat where he swam... The shade where he slept... It is still the same...
12193 : Ah...I know you are there... But to have someone hear my pain...has lightened my soul...if only a little...
12194 : This moat...where I fell in...
12195 : I slipped...on the bridge... I fell...
12196 : He was always there... I didn't notice...
12197 : From the time that I was small... Always there to save me...
12198 : Even when I was loathed and feared... You were there to praise my power...
12199 : My brother...
12200 : But I...I was always angry... I even forgot the lunch you made...
12201 : But here... I want to tell you just once...
12202 : Thank you... Thank you for being there...for me...
12203 : Your lunches...always made with so much care...
12204 : I see you there... Listening to me... I should curse you... But I will forgive you...as my brother would...
12205 : These trees... I burned with the Fire spell... Yet they have grown back...
12206 : This stream... I froze with Blizzaga II... Yet now it flows...
12207 : This building... I toppled with Aeroga III... Yet it has been rebuilt...
12208 : The wall of the Metalworks... I cracked with Thunder IV... Yet it has been repaired...
12209 : It is as if...I never existed... Have my sins...also been erased...?
12210 : My magic...has always been overpowerful... The cold stares...of the townspeople...
12211 : I learned my spells...for vengeance... People called me...heartless...
12212 : I loathed...this nation...this town...its people...
12213 : Then why...? Why do I feel so at home here...?
12214 : Why...? Why does everything feel...so dear to me...?
12215 : You...I see you... Cease your stalking... I wish to be alone...
12216 : A genius...is never understood...by the masses...
12217 : A genius...is isolated...from the common people...
12218 : A genius...will be persecuted...by those who do not understand...
12219 : I wanted to save her... The girl with astounding talent...
12220 : To help...the girl...who had nothing but her magic...
12221 : The Dark Lilies... A coven of...chosen... A sanctuary...for witches...
12222 : Yet...I wonder... Was it all...for the best...? To leave...this world behind...?
12223 : Was she...truly happy...? Being enveloped...in the darkness...?
12224 : I wanted to search...for the answers...one more time... In this town...the town I had forsaken...
12225 : I wished to gaze once more...on the answers to be found... In this town...that I once loved...
12226 : You...go back... Back to the exorcist... Tell him...I am ready...to leave...
12227 : This...was a secret place...
12228 : A place...that nobody knew...
12229 : The perrrfect spot...
12230 : An enchanted spot... So many fish... They would just jump...onto the hook...
12231 : To fill...my empty belly...
12232 : To help...my strrruggling mother...
12233 : I would fish...and fish...and fish... We were poor...I had no other choice...
12234 : Even so...those days were fun... But I hated...being poor... I delved...into forbidden magic...
12235 : I'm sorry...Mother... The day...I left home... I wanted...wanted to tell you...
12236 : I'm sorry... I brrroke my prrromise...to lead an honest life... I wanted...wanted to tell you...
12237 : Enough... You have learned my secret... Leave me in peace...
12238 : Glimmer...shimmer... Shimmer...glimmer...
12239 : Little fishies... Shimmering fishy-wishies... Where have you gone...?
12240 : Little fishies... Glimmering fishy-wishies... Are you here...?
12241 : You mustaru be here... You mustaru be hiding...
12242 : Here and there... The fishy-wishies I let free... Shimmering...glimmering...fish...
12243 : But...I don'taru see you...? Where have you gone...?
12244 : The same as before... Nowhere to be found...
12245 : But wait... That...shimmer-glimmering... The Flash spell fused into your scaly-wales...
12246 : Glimmer...shimmer... So many little fishy-wishies... You survived...
12247 : Shimmer...glimmer... So many little fishy-wishies... You swim...and glide...
12248 : Are you satisfied...? Then hushy-wush and leave... You'll scare the fishy-wishies...
12249 : You hear a voice speaking softly...
12250 : Trick or treat? I've seen the most sensationally scary costumes around town, kupo!
12251 : What a wonderful witch hat, kupo! Since you've shown me your costume, I'll bring out some of my special merchandise, kupo!
12252 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
12253 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
12254 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
12255 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
12256 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
12257 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
12258 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
12259 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
12260 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
12261 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
12262 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
12263 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
12264 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
12265 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
12266 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
12267 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
12268 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
12269 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
12270 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
12271 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
12272 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
12273 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
12274 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
12275 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
12276 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
12277 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
12278 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.
12279 : %'s badge flashes brightly.
12280 : Beyond the Gugru Blue lies an enormous continent, or so they say.
12281 : I wonder what kind of monsters you can find there... Of course, beginners shouldn't venture far outside of town, no matter what nation they're in!
12282 : Don'taru you think the world's become all so rowdy-dowdy lately? The Manustery's remodeling the Cardians like there's no tomorrow!
12283 : There could plausibly, possibly be a war soon! Could it entail...an expedient expedition to the Near East? No way, right!?
12284 : That should be none of your concern.
12285 : So long as the Star Sibyl blesses us with her presence, the peace of Windurst is a given.
12286 : Among the guards of Windurst are the automatons who speaky-weaky in the words of the stars.
12287 : I heardy-weardy that there are automatons in Aht Urhgan too, but they can't do what ours can! Talk about boring-woring!
12288 : Munch-munch...chew-chew... What's that? Something about Aht Urhgan? I heard that the beastmen there are crazy-wazy! Rumor has it that they even attack the towns sometimes!
12289 : If I could just go there on a business trip, I'd have enough scoops to last the rest of my life! Then again, if the rumors are true, that might not be very long!
12290 : Hm. I infer somebody wants to know-know about Aht Urhgan, perhaps? Then you should look up at this night's night sky.
12291 : Compared to the night sky, this world is small. Perhaps it holds that that you seek.
12292 : Eh? Whaddaya want with me, pal?
12293 : Show her Leleroon's letter? Yes. Not now.
12294 : You gotta be pullin' my whiskers! It's a letter from Leleroon!
12295 : Um... Is that a 5? eA...GoOol... RetOoorN...i...T...6? Huh?
12296 : Ahaha. I can't rrread a word of it. Looks like Leleroon hasn't changed a bit.
12297 : So, you're part of the Seagull Phrrratrie, are ya? Nice of you to come this far, [brrrother/sister]!
12298 : The ship got a big chunk blown out of its hull, right? Well, I've had quite a bit happen to me as well, and somehow I ended up here.
12299 : Anyway, now I'm disguising myself as your rrrun-o'-the mill adventurer...
12300 : But in trrruth, I'm Zhuk Vojahom, the Seagull Phratrie's queen o' the dice!
12301 : What's your prrroblem? You dare doubt me?
12302 : It's true! I'm the only match for Qultada in a game of dice!
12303 : So you wanna know how many times I've won, do you?
12304 : ...
12305 : That's none of your business.
12306 : Anyway, now that I've received official contact and everything, I suppose I'd better head back to Aradjiah!
12307 : Thanks for bringing the letter to me!
12308 : To show my gratitude, I can make you something special.
12309 : All I need is %, %, %, and %...
12310 : And then everything will be set!
12311 : I'll make you a prize fit for the captain.
12312 : Good luck finding the materials.
12313 : You alrrready forgot?
12314 : %, %, %, and %!
12315 : Now go get 'em!
12316 : You got them all? Grrreat!
12317 : By the way, you can't expect me to do such a kind deed for frrree, but bring me # ), too, and I'll consider the price paid.
12318 : You think that's expensive? Don't you get cheap on me!
12319 : They all know you in the Near East now, don't they? It should be like taking pamamas from a kitten.
12320 : # ), okay? I'm rrrooting for you here.
12321 : Hm... Yep, looks like they're all here!
12322 : Now you just have to wait for me to make it, okay?
12323 : It won't take long, so stop giving me that look. Heh heh, no one'll be able to match this. You better apprrreciate it.
12324 : Patience, patience! Give me some time, will ya? Go cloudgazing or something and come back later!
12325 : Ta-da! All finished!
12326 : Now this is a well-made item! You better not drrrag it through the mud, got it?
12327 : Heheheh. Looking good.
12328 : Now go take flight above the rolling waves, Seagull!
12329 : Ah, even just the memories make me burn to get back to the Phratrie... The ocean is calling me home!
12330 : (Maybe I'll make this % the wager for my 152nd match with Qultada...)
12331 : (This time I'll beat him for sure!)
12332 : See ya at the base, then!
12333 : The door is firmly shut...
12334 : Harrumph! The Federation has gone rotten, I tell you. Rotten! Who would have thought the day would come when people would forget the name Kayeel-Payeel, Master Caster of the Aquarian War Warlocks!
12335 : If Warlock Warlord Robel-Akbel were only alive today, heads would roll!
12336 : How long do the five ministries and the Parliament of Patriarchs plan on keeping his position empty? How long must Fort Karugo-Narugo remain in ruins?
12337 : Aaarrrggghhh!!! Useless! Completaruly useless!
12338 : It's too late. Far too late....
12339 : What's wrong!? Isn't this the book you've been searching for?
12340 : Yes, yes, the book is astounding. It contains a comprehensive guide on how to brew all manner-wanner of potions and poultices. I now know that the essence of the fireblossom will prove efficacious in curing the Eternal Slumber sickness...
12341 : Only...every known source of fireblossom was destroyed towards the end of the Great War.
12342 : !!!
12343 : After spending so many days and weeks and months scour-wouring the Rhinostery records and the Library of Magic archives...
12344 : After finally locating this Far Eastern tome and learning the method for making the medicine...
12345 : ...
12346 : I find that the information in the book is meaningless!
12347 : And now she will slumber-wumber forever...
12348 : Oh, we have a guestaru.
12349 : Hm? Who's he? That's Maju-Naju, a Rhinostery researcher.
12350 : I can explain his somewhat unscientific behavior-wavior...
12351 : Have you heard of the Eternal Slumber sickness? Maju-Naju has been researching a cure for the pastaru twenty years.
12352 : And it has all been for her...
12353 : You see, Maju-Naju has a Mithra friend he's known since childhood.
12354 : Her name is Shahr Yagenmhi. Maju-Naju occasionally asks me to care for her, so I understand his desperation.
12355 : Shahr was said to be an incredibly brightaru and cheerful child.
12356 : But she had the misfortune to contractaru a ridiculously rare and insidious illness known as the Eternal Slumber sickness.
12357 : A victim of this fright-wightful illness will gradually sleep for longer and longer periods each night, until eventually the body enters a comatose state...
12358 : With the proper care, Shahr won't actually perish, but she will also never wake again.
12359 : If you saw her now, it would seem that she might open her eyes at any momentaru. However, Shahr has been trapped within her dreams for more than twenty years...
12360 : The key was the essence of the fireblossom, the last remnants of which were losty-wost by the end of the Great War...
12361 : Well, I'm sure Maju-Naju has no further wish to peruse this book. Perhaps you mightaru be interested in brush-wushing up on your herbology?
12362 : Oh, hello there. You have business with Maju-Naju?
12363 : You wish to return a book?
12364 : I'd be happy to handy-wand it over for you. Wait, isn't this the tome describing a possible cure for the Eternal Slumber sickness? I don'taru believe he needs it anymore.
12365 : Hm? Well, he did concoctaru the medicine to treat his wife Shahr's illness some years ago now...
12366 : Ooo, come een, come een. Vous have come to cook, non?
12367 : What's zat? Do I know of any unique and extraordinarily new delectable foods?
12368 : Vous know, I may be zee only chef in Vana'diel with zee verve and zee vision to make such an innovative and unorzodox deesh.
12369 : And I will prepare such a deesh, just pour vous. But, eet will require some rare ingredients zat vous must bring moi. C'est bien, non?

12376 : Ooo, zere vous are! I have been waiting pour vous. Zis is zee special deesh which you requested, %! Bon appetit!
12377 : Zis is a classic recipe I have not used in years. I may have forgotten some of zee finer points, but zee taste alone I still remember.
12378 : The dish's presentation is difficult to put into words...
12379 : Eet may not be zee most beautiful deesh, but zat eez no matter! I gladly stake my reputation on eets taste!
12380 : Bonjour! And how was zee % I made pour vous? Delicious, non?
12381 : Eez zat a knife vous have zere? Ooo, zat takes moi back. I use to have a a piece of cutlery just like zat a long time ago.
12382 : Back zen I never would have imagined zat zings would turn out like zey have. C'est la vie, non?

12384 : Wait zere just a moment. I will sharpen eet just pour vous!
12385 : Vous see? Good as new, non?
12386 : Cooking eez a form of love. Vous must want to bring happiness to people through zee food. And eet eez important to love zee tools zat vous use. Take good care of zat knife from now on.
12387 : Why, if it isn't one of our custom stewpots!
12388 : Oh, good heavens, what a ghastly hole...
12389 : I fear I'm not much with repairs, but I do believe Ranpi-Monpi next door could be of service.
12390 : Ze what? You are looking to buy a new stewpot, you zay?
12391 : Mon dieu! Zat ees one hole tres gigantique!
12392 : But zere ees no need for panique! Mais non! Ze ezteemed Ranpi-Monpi will feex it up for you, good as nouveau!

12396 : Voila! Ees she not ze toute beaute? Treat her well, and au revoir!
12397 : The title reads: The Compleat Compendium of Curses.
12398 : A page corner has been folded over.
12399 : Curses, and the Defense and Treatment Thereof.
12400 : Take ye % unto a spring favored by pixiekind. Immerse it of a night in the pure, cleansing waters. Thus doth the % assume counter-curse properties.
12401 : Ground the resultant ingredient into a fine powder, from which an infusion can be prepared for the afflicted.
12402 : The instructions continue...
12403 : Be ye fairly warned: Curses are manifold and complex in nature. Ergo, this remedy may prove fruitless against certain strains of the affliction.
12404 : Hey, there. Got a moment? I just have to spread the word. We managed to create an astrolabe based on Lago's famed stellar-wellar map!
12405 : But this isn't any old run-of-the-mill-will astrolabe, no siree! The constellations of the gods are represented with rare jewels that impart an otherworldly luster to it. Doesn't that make you want to wrest it from us and make it your own?
12406 : Does it make you want one? Yes, I must have it now! No, not particularly.
12407 : You sure do have a keen eye for gadgets. Vana'diel needs more aesthetes of your caliber so it can adapt to the changing times.
12408 : Pfff. If you don't covet this device more than anything in the world, you have no concept of what value-walue is.
12409 : ...It's a travesty that we spent too much procuring the gemstones that adorn it. Now we don't have the funds to research any other topics!
12410 : I speak for us all when I say we want nothing less than to part with this revolutionary tool. Yet the minister would have our head-weads if he found out what we've done. Therefore, could you please take it off our hands?
12411 : How does # gil sound? Good enough. Too high for a favor.
12412 : Are your heart and mind ready?
12413 : You fine with paying # gil? Yes, of course. No, not yet.
12414 : I can't go any lower. We're already losing too much at this price. Feel free to mull it over and come back when you change your mind. (Just be stealthy about it when you do.)
12415 : Let's see here...
12416 : Your contribution to the Orastery and stargazers everywhere is much appreciated.
12417 : Obtained key item: %!
12418 : I hate to be the harbinger of bad news, but we don't do multiple payments. We need it all up front.
12419 : Well met! I'm a Merry Map Marker, and I'd love to make marks all over your merry %, but it appears you are missing the markable map I mention.
12420 : Good day! I'm a Merry Map Marker, and I'd be emphatically ecstatic if you'd allow me to mark your magical map!
12421 : A markless % is like a motherless maiden, meandering through a miasmatic mire of misery.
12422 : Embark on a map-marking mission? Mark me up! Keep your mitts off my map!
12423 : Marvelous! Now allow me a minute to make all my marks.
12424 : Methinks I have marked your map with as many marks as I might manage.
12425 : Monitoring and managing your marks is as simple as merely opening your map and selecting Markers from the main menu.
12426 : If the marks on your map might vanish, mope not like a melancholy milksop. Make another meeting with me and I shall make it my mission to mark the map once more.
12427 : Good day, [milord/milady]. May your marches across meadow and mountain be markedly memorable!
12428 : Here is the area's home point. Once set, your muted remains will be moved here if you are ever...mortally mangled in the midst of a melee.
12429 : Here you will find the immigration ministers. They will help you if you may wish to immediately modify your nationality.
12430 : And mayhap you are immeasurably motivated to compete in the medieval mayhem of Conflict? Might I suggest you mingle with the modest Pursuivant located here?

12432 : Ah, and in the case you might wish to mask a meritorious moniker and replace it with one a mite more merited, a traveling bard strums upon his mellifluous harp here.
12433 : Here, you may meet with a member of the Specialty Goods Trade Union. And, if you are a citizen of this mighty dominion, he'll teleport you all across Vana'diel (for a menial amount of monetary remuneration).
12434 : Need to know the local weather? Our local meteorologist will be making his paramount presumptions here.
12435 : If you wish to summon a merciful mate to this mighty realm, here is where you will find a merry merchant marketing Gold World Passes.

12561 : Digging for treasure will improve your chocobo's intelligence, but will place some strain on the animal and may decrease its stamina.
12562 : Your chocobo can even appear in plays. This will require your chocobo to perform simple acts and will improve its receptivity.
12563 : You will receive a gil payment for this service, but appearing in a play will have a negative effect on the animal's strength and will place some strain on your chocobo.

12596 : If you watch over your chocobo, it will gradually return your affection.
12597 : Telling your chocobo a story will help it develop a healthy psychological state. Remember that concentrating on your speech will have a slightly tiring effect on the animal, though.

12599 : You're interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing. Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it's alright as long as it's done peacefully.
12600 : Venturing outside of town with your chocobo will improve the bond between the two of you. If you don't wander off too far, your chocobo should not get very tired, either.

12612 : Purchase a chococard? (# gil each) Yes. Not now.
12613 : To enter your chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you must first receive %.
12614 : Then, simply trade that document to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
12615 : Would you like a free form? Right away! Maybe later.
12616 : You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your %.

12626 : Anyway, I can give you a new %, but you're going to have to pay # gil for it.
12627 : Purchase %? (# gil) Yes. Not now.
12628 : Hm... This seems to be in great condition! We shouldn't need to do any work on it at the moment.
12629 : Hm... This %'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak...
12630 : For a small fee, I can give you a new % in exchange for it if you wish.
12631 : Pay for a new whistle? (# gil) Yes, please. Not yet.
12632 : Here you go. Take good care of it.
12633 : All right... You can have this back, then.

12637 : Stop caring for your chocobo? Yes. No!
12638 : You will never be able to see your chocobo again. Is that okay with you?
12639 : Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?
12640 : What would you like to say? Nothing. I'm sorry. It's just an animal! We weren't compatible. Take good care of it.
12641 : Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...
12642 : Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...
12643 : ... I'm disappointed in you.
12644 : I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!
12645 : We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.
12646 : Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!
12647 : You really want to retire your chocobo?
12648 : Retire your chocobo? Yes. Not yet!
12649 : Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?
12650 : Understood. We hope you enjoyed raising your chocobo.
12651 : Of course not! Such a decision cannot be made in haste!
12652 : Your chocobo learns Gallop!
12653 : Your chocobo learns Canter!
12654 : Your chocobo learns Burrow!
12655 : Your chocobo learns Bore!
12656 : Your chocobo learns Auto-Regen!
12657 : Your chocobo learns Treasure Finder!
12658 : I'm afraid we still aren't finished using the %, so I will have to return your item to you.

12660 : The chocobo looks like it's already full, but it's forcing itself to eat...
12661 : Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. You cannot feed it now.

12666 : What would you like to ask about? The Vana'diel Chocobo Society. Time required. Chocobo attributes. Care schedule. Caring for your chocobo. Feed. Abilities and personality. Retirement. Matchmaking. Calling chocobos in the field. Items. Lost chicks. Nothing.
12667 : Just let me know if you ever get curious!
12668 : The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.
12669 : They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.
12670 : Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.
12671 : Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.
12672 : They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.
12673 : The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.
12674 : But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!
12675 : Ask about which attribute? Strength. Endurance. Discernment. Receptivity. Energy. Affection. Satisfaction. Nothing.
12676 : Strength is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.
12677 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
12678 : Endurance is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.
12679 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
12680 : Discernment is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.
12681 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
12682 : Receptivity is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.
12683 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
12684 : Energy is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.
12685 : You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!
12686 : Affection is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!
12687 : You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.
12688 : If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it %, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.
12689 : Satisfaction is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.
12690 : However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.
12691 : What would you like to ask about? What is a care schedule? Basic care. Resting. Taking a walk. Listening to music. Exercising alone. Exercising in a group. Interacting with children. Interacting with chocobos. Carrying packages. Exhibiting to the public. Delivering messages. Digging for treasure. Acting in a play. Nothing.
12692 : A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.
12693 : How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.
12694 : You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).
12695 : When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.
12696 : With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.
12697 : The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.
12698 : You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.
12699 : The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.
12700 : However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.
12701 : We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.
12702 : Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.
12703 : Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.
12704 : If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
12705 : Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.
12706 : If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
12707 : Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.
12708 : However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.
12709 : If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
12710 : Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.
12711 : But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.
12712 : If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
12713 : You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!
12714 : The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.
12715 : You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.
12716 : The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.
12717 : You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!
12718 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
12719 : You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.
12720 : The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.
12721 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
12722 : You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.
12723 : You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
12724 : What would you like to ask about? A general explanation. Watching over your chocobo. Telling a story. Scolding. Competing. Taking a walk. Nothing.
12725 : In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.
12726 : Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.
12727 : On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.
12728 : However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.
12729 : You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.
12730 : Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.
12731 : You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.
12732 : I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)
12733 : Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.
12734 : This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.
12735 : Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.
12736 : You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.
12737 : I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.
12738 : Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!
12739 : What would you like to know about? Why feeding is important. Vegetables. Wildgrasses. Carrots. Worms. Medicines. Pastes. Nothing.
12740 : Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.
12741 : However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.
12742 : The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.
12743 : At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!
12744 : Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.
12745 : There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!
12746 : Just trade the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.
12747 : This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which % are most popular.
12748 : Chocobos also seem to enjoy % and %.
12749 : These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.
12750 : Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.
12751 : %, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to %, the effects are different.
12752 : In addition, % is effective for illness, and % for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.
12753 : Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.
12754 : %, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and % are good for its mental attributes. % are in a category of their own.
12755 : Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.
12756 : Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!
12757 : For example, % will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and % will restore its energy.
12758 : But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...
12759 : The most curious of all the worms is the %. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...
12760 : Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.
12761 : % will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.
12762 : % are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.
12763 : A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.
12764 : Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.
12765 : You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.
12766 : Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.
12767 : Which would you like to ask about? Abilities. Temperament. Weather preferences. Nothing.
12768 : Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.
12769 : For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.
12770 : Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.
12771 : But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.
12772 : The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.
12773 : Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.
12774 : Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.
12775 : Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.
12776 : You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.
12777 : After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.
12778 : When your chocobo retires, you will receive %. Be sure not to lose it.
12779 : You can use the % to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.
12780 : The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!
12781 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.
12782 : You will need % and % if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.
12783 : You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them %.
12784 : I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.
12785 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using %.
12786 : You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.
12787 : That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.
12788 : When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade % to a VCS member.
12789 : Also, the %'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.
12790 : If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.
12791 : What would you like to ask about? %. Chococards. %. Nothing.
12792 : % proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.
12793 : With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.
12794 : If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!
12795 : You can use % to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.
12796 : The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.
12797 : Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get %, so good luck with that...
12798 : Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.
12799 : If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.
12800 : Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.
12801 : If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade % to a VCS member.

13214 : Its owner must be searching for the chick as well. You should probably check the areas where people take their chocobos on walks, first.
13215 : If you discover any relevant information, have Arvilauge take down the details for you.
13216 : %, have you had any luck locating the chick's owner? I have been collecting information on my own time, as well...

13224 : I found the chick's owner and returned it to its home.

13227 : Chicks tend to cry a lot, but I think this is worse than normal...
13228 : I've got an idea. Could you hold on to this % for a while?
13229 : Having something with your scent and warmth on it should comfort the chick.
13230 : I think that should be enough. Let me see the % now.

13232 : Thanks to the %,  has been sleeping like a baby.

13250 : A chick has hatched from the egg!
13251 : Isn't it cute? You can name it later.

13458 : %, do you think you could search for its owner? We'll take care of it here at the stables until you find who it belongs to.

13472 : I know chicks cry a lot, but this is the worst...
13473 : I know! Could you hold on to this % for a while?

13477 : Thanks to the %,  has been sleeping like a baby!

13896 : You see something half-buried under the straw. Could it be %...?
13897 : You find something on the floor of the chocobo stall. Could it be %...?
13898 : Ah, it appears your chocobo found this during one of your walks.
13899 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
13900 : Looks like your chocobo found this on one of your walks.
13901 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
13902 : It seems your chocobo found this on one of your walks.
13903 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
13904 : Obtained: %!
13905 : Inventory is full. % could not obtain the %.
13906 : Could not trade the % and %. Please try again.
13907 : Hear the report? Hear a detailed report. Hear a brief report. Skip the report. I'm done here.
13908 : Are you sure? Yes. No.
13909 : Continue the report? Please do. I've heard enough.
13910 : Skip all remaining reports? No. Yes.
13911 : One moment please...
13912 : Choose the pace for your [short walk/regular walk/long walk]. Leisurely. Brisk. Cancel.
13913 : Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.
13914 : I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.
13915 : Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess % or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.
13916 : How about you, [sir/ma'am]?
13917 : If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in [Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.
13918 : What do you say? Tell me more. Sign me up! Not today.
13919 : Congratulations, %! You are now an official member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
13920 : I see. Please come back if you ever change your mind!
13921 : What would you like to know? Why race chocobos, anyway? How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kind of races are there? What are racing teams? Quit. Return.
13922 : Why not!? Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.
13923 : We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A win-win situation, as we like to call it in the business.
13924 : However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...
13925 : The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.
13926 : And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.
13927 : Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!
13928 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
13929 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
13930 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
13931 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
13932 : Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.
13933 : Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.
13934 : In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.
13935 : Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.
13936 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
13937 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
13938 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
13939 : There are two main types of races.
13940 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
13941 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
13942 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
13943 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
13944 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.
13945 : You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)
13946 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
13947 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
13948 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
13949 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
13950 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
13951 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
13952 : Ah, it says here that you are a member of the [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
13953 : Have you come today to change your affiliation?
13954 : Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
13955 : Join this team? Yes. No.
13956 : Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
13957 : Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.
13958 : Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.
13959 : What do we have here...
13960 : %:
13961 : Alright, %, I will store this in our safe.
13962 : Alright, %, I will store these in our safe.

13964 : I am sorry, but you have already brought me these items.

13968 : You cannot access this menu until you have registered a chocobo to race.

13970 : You can only register one chocobo at a time, but you may always register a new one whenever you wish.

13974 : Re-run which race? Novice Race I. Novice Race II. Novice Race III. Challenge Race I. International Race I. International Race II. Challenge Race II. CRA Classic. Quit. Return.

13977 : Here is the information on the next race:
13978 : ----------------------------------------
13979 : Free Run Chocobos: 8 Objective: None
13980 : While free runs usually have no specific objectives, the higher your chocobo places, the better the prize you will receive. We suggest you use these races to improve your skills before embarking on the more difficult official races.
13981 : Here is the information on the next race:
13982 : Novice Race I Chocobos: 4 Objective: Place 3rd or higher

13984 : Novice Race II Chocobos: 6 Objective: Place 3rd or higher
13985 : This time, your chocobo will be pitted against five opponents. Use your knowledge of your bird's strengths to provide the jockey with the most appropriate orders.
13986 : Novice Race III Chocobos: 8 Objective: Place 3rd or higher
13987 : This race is quite similar to a free run in that there will be seven other chocobos racing against you. If you have one available, try equipping an item to improve your bird's performance.
13988 : Challenge Race I Chocobos: 2 Objective: Place 1st

14128 : A standard model, the lauan saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride.
14129 : A standard model, the ash saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
14130 : A standard model, the elm saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
14131 : A bit on the hefty side, the brass saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
14132 : A bit on the hefty side, the silver saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
14133 : A bit on the hefty side, the mythril saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.
14134 : This lightweight grass saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
14135 : This lightweight cotton saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
14136 : This lightweight linen saddle can create a marked improvement in physical performance. However, a chocobo will require some degree of discernment to reap its benefits.
14137 : Crafted from the finest rabbit hide, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
14138 : Crafted from the finest sheep leather, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.
14139 : Crafted from the finest buffalo leather, this saddle can improve physical performance, but only for chocobos with at least moderate receptivity.

14144 : Do you wish to proceed? Yes! I'm ready to tear up the track! I'm getting cold feet...
14145 : Very well. You have now been registered to race.
14146 : My apologies, but it seems that over four weeks have elapsed since your last race. As much as it pains me to do so, I will be forced to deduct # Solo Victory [Point/Points] from your account.

14163 : Join the [ /San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team? Yes, at once. No, not now.
14164 : If you would just wait one moment while I fill out the necessary paperwork...

14209 : Current Standings Three-nation deadlock!
14210 : Last Week's Standings Team San d'Oria: # Team Bastok: # Team Windurst: #
14211 : Helping your team into first will give you certain advantages over your rivals! That should give you something to strive for!
14212 : What would you like to know about? The promenade. Chocobet centers. The grandstand. Portals. Guides. Nothing for now.
14213 : Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.
14214 : It can be found just south of here.
14215 : The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.
14216 : Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring %, as well as collecting your winnings.
14217 : There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.
14218 : All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.
14219 : The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.
14220 : To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.
14221 : The standard admission fee is # gil. Patrons who possess % may enter free of charge.
14222 : % will be provided anytime you purchase % or sign up for a race.
14223 : Your % will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.
14224 : This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.
14225 : As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.
14226 : For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished. Your cooperation is appreciated.
14227 : Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.
14228 : They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.
14229 : This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.
14230 : What would you like to know about? Racing teams. Race rules. Race types. Victory points. Race Progression. That's about it.
14231 : A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.
14232 : Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.
14233 : In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.
14234 : For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.
14235 : The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.
14236 : What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.
14237 : Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.
14238 : Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.
14239 : The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.
14240 : The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.
14241 : The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.
14242 : In such an event, the less endowed of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.
14243 : Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.
14244 : Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the race grade.
14245 : For example, a C4 Chocobo Race would indicate a typical grade 4 race.
14246 : We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.
14247 : No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.
14248 : Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.
14249 : As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.
14250 : Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.
14251 : Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.
14252 : Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.
14253 : The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.
14254 : As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.
14255 : Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.
14256 : We have a total of four races that run in succession.
14257 : Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.
14258 : Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.
14259 : Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!
14260 : What would you like to hear more about? Race preparations. Signup procedure. Collecting winnings. Signing up for another race. I'm fine, thanks.
14261 : There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.
14262 : First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.
14263 : Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a race chocobo, for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.
14264 : Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...
14265 : All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.
14266 : A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.
14267 : Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.
14268 : There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.
14269 : There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.
14270 : Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given %, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.
14271 : In the event that you should lose or misplace your %, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.
14272 : The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!
14273 : You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.
14274 : To collect, simply hand in the % you received during race signup at any signup center.
14275 : The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.
14276 : You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.
14277 : After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
14278 : This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.
14279 : We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.
14280 : What would you like to ask? What is chocobetting? How do I bet? What are odds? When do I bet? How do I collect winnings? Nothing.
14281 : Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.
14282 : To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.
14283 : Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.
14284 : For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.
14285 : And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.
14286 : Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.
14287 : The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!
14288 : To place a chocobet, you must obtain % from the chocobet center.
14289 : For any single %, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.
14290 : We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.
14291 : Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.
14292 : Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.
14293 : It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.
14294 : What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.
14295 : Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.
14296 : The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.
14297 : Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.
14298 : Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.
14299 : Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.
14300 : Once the race is finished, you can exchange your % at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.
14301 : Without % you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.
14302 : % is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.
14303 : Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.
14304 : Attention, racers. Signups for the following race are now open:
14305 : Please speak with the attendant wearing [an orange/a green/a red/a blue] uniform and a red beret for details. ----------

14357 : You obtain %!
14358 : Greetings, and welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service area is here to accommodate our more experienced and accomplished racers.
14359 : I am truly sorry [sir/ma'am], but we are unable to service your request here. This service area only caters to [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] CRA Classic winners.
14360 : Registration for such an event can be carried out at the service areas for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
14361 : The organizing attendants in each location are as follows: [Southern San d'Oria: Alangriche/Bastok Mines: Jazgeh/Windurst Waters: Turumi-Byrumi] [Northern San d'Oria: Monteverle/Bastok Markets: Galienne/Windurst Port: Lhimo Keanyohn] [Port San d'Oria: Ramiene/Port Bastok: Salvador/Windurst Woods: Rungaga].
14362 : For beginning and intermediate races, you'll want to speak with [Alangriche/Jazgeh/Rungaga].
14363 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
14364 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for advanced and veteran racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
14365 : Which would you like to hear about? CRA rationale behind veteran races. How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kinds of races are there? What are racing teams? What about race opponents? Quit. Return.
14366 : With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.
14367 : As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!
14368 : The Monster Races!
14369 : Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing!
14370 : Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele. What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?
14371 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
14372 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
14373 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
14374 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
14375 : Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!
14376 : The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal. It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.
14377 : Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern. If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.
14378 : Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area. Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.
14379 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
14380 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
14381 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
14382 : There are two main types of races.
14383 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
14384 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
14385 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
14386 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
14387 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.
14388 : You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Thank you for your understanding.
14389 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
14390 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
14391 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
14392 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
14393 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
14394 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
14395 : Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.
14396 : We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence. The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.
14397 : Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits. And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.
14398 : As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind. It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack. Consider yourself warned.
14399 : In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well. Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part. It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!
14400 : Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed. These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.
14401 : Dueler's Race Participants: 2 Objective: Place 1st
14402 : And now, Markovich's undeniably unorthodox, and arguably downright unethical, monster race is about to begin!
14403 : Survival Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
14404 : Following such a fine showing in the Dueler's Race, the next contest is about to start! Who will be the last beast standing?
14405 : Deadly Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
14406 : Warning! The next race contains monsters of unprecedented nastiness. Enter at your own risk! The name says it all!
14407 : Mystery Race Participants: 4 chocobos & 4 ??? Objective: Place 1st
14408 : What's this? We've been asked to pass along yet another challenge, this time from an anonymous source! I'm not altogether clear on what is about to transpire...
14409 : Lethal Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
14410 : The games are over, ladies and gentlemen. Markovich is laying it all on the table. Here come his most ferocious beasts to date!
14411 : Dream Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
14412 : This is the moment you've all been waiting for. The CRA has brought its racing elite out from the stables! The treacherous offroad track is fraught with perils! And an absolutely awe-inspiring trophy is ready for the winner! Bragging rights for life are on the line!

14461 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.
14462 : Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...
14463 : ...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.
14464 : Good day, fol--
14466 : Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.
14467 : Alrighty then, our next race features # of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.
14468 : First we have , who will be ridden by [the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing allstar, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].
14470 : She says, When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.
14471 : She says, And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' allstar!
14472 : She says, This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.
14473 : She says, There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.
14474 : She says, This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.
14475 : She says, Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.
14476 : She says, This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.
14477 : She says, This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'
14478 : Next we have [Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by [the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].
14479 : Sakura says, Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!
14480 : Sakura says, This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.
14481 : Sakura says, Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.
14482 : Our next chocobo is [Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by [Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].
14483 : Sakura says, Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.
14484 : Sakura says, She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.
14486 : Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...
14487 : The next contestant is [Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by [chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].
14488 : She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.
14489 : She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.
14490 : She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.
14491 : And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.
14492 : And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?
14493 : The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.
14494 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
14495 : And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
14496 : ...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!
14497 : Good day, fol--
14499 : Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.
14500 : And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!
14501 : ##:  ##:  ##:  ##:
14502 : And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
14503 : Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
14504 : I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.
14505 : Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!
14506 : Yeah... Good luck, %...
14507 : Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.
14508 : And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, [Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].
14509 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'
14510 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.
14511 : Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.
14512 : They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.
14513 : Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell [him/her], Wahboud!
14514 : Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!
14515 : As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.
14516 : %. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.
14517 : Good luck, %. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!
14518 : Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!
14519 : And next we have [Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by [VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].
14521 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.
14522 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.
14523 : Sakura says, Big things often come in small packages.
14524 : Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--
14525 : a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!
14526 : This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.
14527 : Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!
14528 : It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted piece de resistance?
14529 : We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.
14530 : Well, there you have it.
14531 : Now let's take a look at today's participants...
14532 : Ladies and gentlemen! President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...
14533 : ...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!
14534 : Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.
14535 : Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?
14536 : Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?
14537 : Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--
14538 : The Rakapopo Cup!
14539 : Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Kupipi!
14540 : So, I've learned that you have entered your very own personal chocobo in the cup. What do you think her chances are of taking home the grand prize?
14541 : Are you making fun of me, sir!? Well, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my gutty-wutty when my Starlight sails across the finish line years before the nearest competitaru!
14542 : Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.
14543 : My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!
14544 : [Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing allstar/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Never heard of [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!
14545 : We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one Kamp Kweh. We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.
14546 : Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...
14547 : Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take more than an embiggened brainy-wainy to beat Starlight!
14548 : What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.
14549 : Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...
14550 : Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fan! I won't let Starlight lose to some imposter!
14551 : Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called reincarnate's redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!
14552 : Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?
14553 : Hah! Well, I have been riding chocobos for twenty-one years!
14554 : And next is [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by [San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!
14555 : Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.
14556 : Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...
14557 : Both Starlight and the professor hate to take orders... Maybe that's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!
14558 : The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.
14559 : When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.
14560 : When the professor's not stumbling over his speech impediment-ethy, he's researching the intricacies of chocobo behavioral patterns.
14561 : And they're off!
14562 : Markovich, what did you think of the start?
14563 : Well, I fel--
14565 : Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
14566 : Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
14567 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
14568 : And as they pass the halfway mark...
14569 : ##  holds on to the lead!
14570 : # different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!
14571 : While from behind the pack, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
14572 : While from behind, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
14573 : All # chocobos battle for the lead!
14574 : Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
14575 : And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
14577 : Sakura says, The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.
14578 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
14579 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
14580 : Incredible! 's speed is approaching dangerous limits!
14581 : It looks like  is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!
14582 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
14583 : 's speed has begun to drop off!
14584 : It looks like  has begun to tire!
14585 : The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
14586 : The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
14587 : The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
14588 : The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
14589 : The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for !?
14590 : Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for !?
14591 : And yet  seems completely unaffected by the attack!
14592 : And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
14593 : And now they're approaching the final corner!
14594 : ##  still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
14595 : It's crowded up front with # chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
14596 : ##  is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
14597 : It's crowded up front with all # chocobos still fighting for the lead!
14598 : The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
14599 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ##  today!
14600 : And  takes the crown!
14601 : What's this? ##  is making its move on the lead!
14602 : And it's  by a beak!!!
14603 : Let's take a look at the results...
14604 : #:  (##)
14605 : There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!
14606 : Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.
14607 : Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.
14608 : Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.
14609 : What an amazing race! The other chocobos were no match for [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?
14610 : What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?
14611 : [Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!
14612 : The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.
14613 : Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!
14614 : Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...
14615 : Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exactly as I expected!
14616 : The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no way Starlight could lose! Her horoscope said so!
14617 : And there you have it. This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!
14618 : And now, let's see the results from the last race.
14619 : #:  (##)
14620 : And that's all she wrote, folks!
14621 : The winnings for a #-# bet come to # gil per quill!
14622 : Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
14623 : She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
14624 : She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
14625 : Until next time, race fans...
14626 : Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.
14627 : Taking the crown for today's race was none other than !
14628 : To the winning steed's owner we present the %, %, and the exalted title of Rocochookie, I mean, Chocorookie!
14629 : And to the ambitious and sporting %, we present this undeniably useful %!
14630 : Good show, %. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.
14631 : Excellent race, %! You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.
14632 : Okay, maybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I still think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!
14633 : Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.
14634 : But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.

14648 : With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...
14649 : Oh...? Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?
14650 : I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.
14651 : Is that so...? Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...
14652 : Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone. You of all people should know that the show must go on!
14653 : Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own baby will be taking the field!
14654 : Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!
14655 : But of course! I had forgotten all about it! Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you! Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!
14656 : But that's not where it ends! There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?
14657 : A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself. Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?
14658 : It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.
14659 : Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state! But...
14660 : But...?
14661 : I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.
14662 : I see... Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?
14663 : You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo. Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?
14664 : But enough talking, I say. It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!
14665 : Oh, yes, right... Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay! It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!
14666 : In the chocobo corner, we have , undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.
14667 : Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo? I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.
14668 : 's formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, a wolf in sheep's clothing!
14669 : I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!
14670 : I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?
14671 : Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that monsters like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.
14672 : Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!
14673 : With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!
14674 : Whoopee! Bring them on, I say!
14675 : Erm...yes... Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.
14676 : Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.
14677 : Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki! Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.
14678 : Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo. I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.
14679 : And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!
14680 : My, oh my...! I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--
14681 : A-ahem! I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.
14682 : All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies! Well done, my pretty! Well done!
14683 : It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders... <Sniffle>
14684 : Next in the lineup is Sakura. ...!? What on Vana'diel!?
14685 : Hrmmm... Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
14686 : Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...
14687 : What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man! There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!
14688 : Um, yes... Please forgive me...
14689 : And won't you look at the lineup! This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks? I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?
14690 : And with me today is our regular guest commentator...
14691 : Huh? Why isn't Markovich here?
14692 : Ohohohohohoho! You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.
14693 : <Gulp> You...you're that mage from Windurst...
14694 : ...Professor Shantotto!
14695 : If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich, as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.
14696 : Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence, four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.
14697 : So if you care to hear out my little proposal, these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.
14698 : With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice... Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?
14699 : With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused? Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.
14700 : First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.
14701 : Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold. I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.
14702 : Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.
14703 : Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word failure. Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.
14704 : Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.
14705 : Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable. If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.
14706 : Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!
14707 : For Ace of Trophies, championship contender is an unfitting description. Even consecutive champion would not be too high an expectation.
14708 : Um...Professor Shantotto... Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?
14709 : Ohohohohoho! Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so. But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!
14710 : Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage. Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.
14711 : Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview. So let the race begin, without further ado!
14712 : Ohohohohohoho! Of this inevitable result, I was always assured-- that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!
14713 : The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor. But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.
14714 : H-hey! What do you think you're trying to pull here!?
14715 : My, my, what a pleasant surprise! I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.
14716 : How dare you ohoho your way into my hard-earned commentary seat! This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!
14717 : Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification. I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.
14718 : And you, Goccilo! What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!
14719 : Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing! Until next time...!
14720 : %, I knew you'd make it all the way here.
14721 : What's with the baffled expression? It's me, Sakura.
14722 : You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird. I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.
14723 : I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.
14724 : I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...
14725 : And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.
14726 : I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.
14727 : Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.
14728 : I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.
14729 : I hope that'll be your chocobo, %!
14730 : And next, we have Sakura. But something seems to be different... Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.
14731 : She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!
14732 : The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.
14733 : I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround! A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.
14734 : And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.
14735 : It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.
14736 : And that completes the lineup, folks. With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!
14737 : You find %.
14738 : Welcome to the Dream Race, %.
14739 : I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.
14740 : I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.
14741 : I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.
14742 : But no more... If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.
14743 : This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.
14744 : I won't hold back in today's race, %.
14745 : Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.
14746 : Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.
14747 : I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?
14748 : Next, we have Sakura...
14749 : Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!? This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!
14750 : Well I'll be... In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!
14751 : ...
14752 : Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks. For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?
14753 : %, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded %, %, and the exalted title of Chocochampion!
14754 : Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far! Congratulations!
14755 : Great race, %. It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.
14756 : But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come.. With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...
14757 : Princess... Princess Sakura!
14758 : Princess...? What are you talking about? Who are you?
14759 : Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion. I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.
14760 : Searching for...me?
14761 : Yes, Your Highness. You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.
14762 : Are you serious!? Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?
14763 : That is correct. Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.
14764 : D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?
14765 : ...! I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...
14766 : Wh...what happened?
14767 : You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world. You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...
14768 : She...she gave up her life to save me?
14769 : Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again. But, I never once gave up hope...
14770 : My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.
14771 : So that's what happened...
14772 : Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos!
14773 : ...
14774 : I'm sorry, but I can't go.
14775 : Your Highness! But...why!?
14776 : Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like %'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.
14777 : What's more...
14778 : I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...
14779 : I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.
14780 : What...?
14781 : The only place I belong is here, beside you.
14782 : And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer? I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?
14783 : I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!
14784 : Heehee! Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!
14785 : %, I'm looking forward to our rematch! Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?
14786 : You're still here, eh, %?
14787 : Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?
14788 : What? How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?
14789 : Hohoho... It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.
14790 : I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...
14791 : Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos? No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.
14792 : Sakura is the queen, you say?
14793 : <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises. But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.
14794 : You know what they say: Home is where the heart is. To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.
14795 : And you, our new Chocochampion! Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.
14796 : Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today. These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.
14797 : And they're off!
14798 : Hrmmm! [Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
14799 : Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
14800 : All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance. But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
14801 : Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
14802 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
14803 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
14804 : The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
14805 : The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
14806 : And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
14807 : It's crowded up front with # contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
14808 : It's crowded up front with all # contestants still fighting for the lead!
14809 : The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
14810 : What's this!?  has used %!
14811 : still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
14812 : is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
14813 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching  today!
14814 : What's this?  is making its move on the lead!
14815 : #:
14816 : What's this!? 's using [Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!
14817 : Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those [monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!
14818 : just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed! And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
14819 : I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about 's step.  And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!
14820 : And here's some unexpected drama, folks! The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
14821 : Look at that! 's stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!
14822 : Uh-oh, what's going on here!? The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
14823 : Oooh! In a bold move,  has just used a [Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!
14824 : What's this!? All of the chocobos other than  and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
14825 : Thanks to that brazen little act,  can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks! That just might seal the deal for !
14826 : Never in all my days, race fans! In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
14827 : How could my creation make such a rookie mistake? In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
14828 : Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
14829 : The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
14830 : The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
14831 : The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
14832 : Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!? What in the world do you think you're doing!?
14833 : Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame. This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
14834 : What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today? I've heard it being said that today's [creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal. This could get heavy, folks!
14835 : All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them. Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
14836 : It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
14837 : There's still plenty of race to go, race fans! More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
14838 : And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
14839 : The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now. This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
14840 : This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent. Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
14841 : And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty! Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
14842 : And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them! But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
14843 : I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call! Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
14844 : It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now! The time for a final spurt is now or never!
14845 : And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
14846 : You see a single, ivory venture roll die on the table. There are currently #/# other players wishing to participate.
14847 : What would you like to do? Join table (# gil). Leave. Read manual.
14848 : There are currently #/# players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)
14849 : You place # gil in the pot.
14850 : The final participant has arrived. Your group is allowed # [minute/minutes] at the table.
14851 : %'s primary roll is #!
14852 : Double up? (Currently: #) Yes. No.
14853 : % doubles up... Your venture roll total is now #!
14854 : % doubles up... BUST!!!
14855 : % holds fast.
14856 : Double up complete.
14857 : Results...
14858 : %'s final total is #!
14859 : % has gone BUST!
14860 : The game has ended in a draw!
14861 : The winner is %!
14862 : Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.
14863 : The final place at the table has already been taken.
14864 : You do not have enough gil.
14865 : Someone has dropped the die!
14866 : Read which chapter? 1. The Heart of Venture Roll. 2. Rules of the Roll. 3. Putting the Book Down.
14867 : Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.
14868 : Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (doubling up) as many times as the table time limit allows (# [minute/minutes], Earth time).
14869 : In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (hold fast).
14870 : If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.
14871 : Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).
14872 : Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.
14873 : If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a draw and all participation fees are repaid in full.
14874 : Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.
14875 : It's here! It's here! The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!
14876 : If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!
14877 : Where would you like to go? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
14878 : See you again, kupo!
14879 : Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!
14880 : Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
14881 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
14882 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
14883 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
14884 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
14885 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
14886 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
14887 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
14888 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
14889 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
14890 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
14891 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
14892 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
14893 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
14894 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
14895 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
14896 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
14897 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
14898 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
14899 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
14900 : You can only carry one %.
14901 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
14902 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
14903 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
14904 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
14905 : You there. I suppose you've heard the gossip flying around town--the talk of part-time ghosts?
14906 : Have you heard? Yes, I've heard. Part-time ghosts!?
14907 : Then we may move on to more important matters.
14908 : We haven't been able to locate enough volunteers to participate in this year's festivities, and are searching for adventurers who would be willing to aid us.
14909 : All you will be required to do is dress up in one of these frightening costumes and wander about the city with the other specters.
14910 : <Sigh>... Then allow me to explain.
14911 : A memorial is currently being held in honor of a long-lost coven of witches known as the Dark Lilies.
14912 : During the memorial, volunteers dressed up as the witches and spirits walk a course about the city in honor of the deceased.
14913 : However, while we have filled all the spots for the witches, we are quite short on people willing to play the part of the monsters who follow the Lilies.
14914 : Would you be willing to lend a hand, fine [sir/lady]?
14915 : Will you help? Of course. Not a ghost of a chance.
14916 : Ah... How droll. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
14917 : Most excellent. There is one thing you must be aware of, however.
14918 : The witches have the most important role in this memorial service. You are to tread only in their wake. If it is found that you have stepped ahead of one of the Lilies, you will be asked to return your costume and leave the procession.
14919 : Though, we are a forgiving organization, and if you wish to participate once again, either speak with me or simply put on another costume and your request shall be granted.
14920 : Ah yes, and one more thing. There are two citizens playing the parts of the witches Guwanana and Bikho Ronpotteh.
14921 : You are to follow the fair Mithran maid dressed as Bikho. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.
14922 : Ah, welcome back, adventurer. You have done well. The Dark Lilies would be pleased.
14923 : Please take this as a token of our appreciation.
14924 : It is a hat modeled after those worn by the Dark Lilies. Perhaps you might wear it during the season's festivities.
14925 : Oh, and should you wish to aid us again, we would welcome your help. Many thanks, %.
14926 : What has befallen you? Do you wish to give up?
14927 : Give up? I'm done. Not yet.
14928 : A pity. Please speak with me again if you change your mind.
14929 : You are to follow the young maiden dressed as Guwanana. Remember this, as you will not receive any compensation in the event you join the wrong group.
14930 : Good day! I suppose you've heard of all the people signing up to play ghosts in this year's festival, nay?
14931 : Have you heard? Yes, I've heard. Play ghosts!?
14932 : I wouldn't expect anything less from an adventurer.
14933 : I'll get straight to the point, then. We need volunteers to dress up as ghosts, specters, wights, and the like, and walk around the city in honor of the Dark Lilies.
14934 : Would you be willing to participate? You will be rewarded nicely!
14935 : Well, you adventurers are pretty busy, I guess. Let me give you the short version:
14936 : We're putting on a grand parade for this season's Harvest Festival.
14937 : We already have enough people to play the witches, but there can never be enough monsters, nay?
14938 : That's why we need volunteers like you to make the parade even more exciting. Oh, worry not, adventurer. You will be rewarded nicely!
14939 : Will you help? Of course. Not a ghost of a chance.
14940 : Oh... Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
14941 : Thank you! Now, there is one thing you should know...
14942 : The witches lead the procession. If you start getting any delusions of grandeur and work your way in front of the Lilies, you will be required to turn over your costume and forfeit all payment for services up to that point.
14943 : But that doesn't mean you can't try again! Just put on another costume and get back in line. I'm sure you'll get the hang of things soon enough.
14944 : Oh, and one more thing. There are two witches in this season's parade: Selma and Pretty Heart.
14945 : You're to be stationed in Selma's parade, so don't go wandering over to Pretty Heart's, hear me?
14946 : Good luck!
14947 : Excellent job, %! You've done the witches proud.
14948 : Here's the reward I promised.
14949 : It's a witch hat. The design matches those worn by the Dark Lilies. Put it on, and go have fun. Forget about ghosts for a while.
14950 : Though, if you want to volunteer again, I'll be right here waiting for you!
14951 : Giving up the ghost, eh?
14952 : Oh... Well, acting isn't everybody's cup of tea. I'll be here if you change your mind.
14953 : You're to be stationed in Pretty Heart's parade, so don't go wandering over to Selma's, hear me?
14954 : Hi, I'm Gertrude. I'm helping with some of the Harvest Festival activities. Have you heard about our hiring policies?
14955 : Heard about them? Yes. Not at all.
14956 : You have? Well, that makes my job easier, then.
14957 : So, would you like to sign up for the Procession of the Lilies?
14958 : No? Then let me fill you in on the details. We are currently holding a memorial for the Dark Lilies, in which two women dressed as members of the lost coven lead a party of spirits around the city.
14959 : There is a shortage of volunteers for the witches' undead followers, and I was wondering if you would like to help.
14960 : Sign up? Right away! Not today.
14961 : Adventurers are often very busy, or so I've heard. Please come back if you change your mind.
14962 : Wonderful. There are just two more things I must warn you of, however.
14963 : First and foremost, during the procession, the witches are boss, so don't even think of stepping in front of them. If you do, your costume will be immediately confiscated.
14964 : Ah, but if that happens, you need not worry. Just put on another costume and try again!
14965 : Secondly, there are two witches in the city--Maryse and Poseaulloie.
14966 : You are to join with Poseaulloie's congregation.
14967 : Good luck!
14968 : How did you fare...? Was the witch pleased?
14969 : Either way, your help has been invaluable. Would you accept this in appreciation?
14970 : It's a witch hat. Please wear it in the festivities and forget about ghosts and spirits for a while...
14971 : Though, if you have time, we would gladly accept your help again.
14972 : What's wrong? Have you grown tired of your duties?
14973 : Oh, I see... Well, please return to me if you find your patience for them restored.
14974 : You are to join with Maryse's congregation.
14975 : I shall let you know when there is another opening.
14976 : I'll let you know when a spot opens up.
14977 : You'll be the first to know when I have a new opening.
14978 : Ooops! You've stepped in front of the witch!
14979 : You can't stop now. You've just started!
14980 : You've only just begun.
14981 : There's still a long way to go.
14982 : Hope you didn't make any other plans, because you're not even close to being finished.
14983 : Almost halfway...
14984 : It's still a little too early to go back.
14985 : Leave the procession now and someone might be peeved.
14986 : Just a little longer...
14987 : You're almost done!
14988 : Alright! It's time to collect your reward!
14989 : You've joined the procession.
14990 : Adventurer! Adventurer!
14991 : Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand? Sure! Doing what? Not today.
14992 : A thousand thanks, kupo! Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!
14993 : Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend! All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the cyclopean crystals located about the strongholds, kupo!
14994 : Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?
14995 : You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.
14996 : Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.
14997 : It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces' victory over the beastmen armies?
14998 : And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...
14999 : However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.
15000 : And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!
15001 : By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!
15002 : One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.
15003 : We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.
15004 : Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...
15005 : ...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.
15006 : The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's Most Valuable Nation and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.
15007 : So, what do you say, kupo? I'm in. Maybe later.
15008 : Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!
15009 : Kupopo...
15010 : Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...
15011 : My records show that you have brought your nation a total of # [shard/shards], but I know you're not done yet, are you?
15012 : Amazing! You've already collected # [shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!
15013 : Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!
15014 : Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those [San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!
15015 : Congratulations on your victory, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!
15016 : Where would like to go, kupo? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
15017 : Happy travels, kupo!
15018 : Moogles from across Vana'diel have heard of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!
15019 : Oooh! It's %! Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!
15020 : ***GM Commands*** ***Use with CAUTION!***
15021 : Set this area's A flag to: Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
15022 : Switch on this area's B flag? No (OFF). Yes (ON).
15023 : Flag settings complete. A Flag: [Nowhere/San/Bas/Win] B Flag: [OFF/ON]
15024 : The Starlight Celebration is here again, kupo!
15025 : And once again, we have a pile of presents for all the adventurers!
15026 : But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo... There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...
15027 : Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!
15028 : I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom. All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!
15029 : We're counting on you, kupo!
15030 : The recipient for this present was supposed to be [level 37 or lower/level 38 or higher].
15031 : And I'm pretty sure we were looking for [a male Hume/a female Hume/a male Elvaan/a female Elvaan/a male Tarutaru/a female Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka].
15032 : Someone who was trained as [a warrior/a monk/a white mage/a black mage/a red mage/a thief/a paladin/a dark knight/a beastmaster/a bard/a ranger/a samurai/a ninja/a dragoon/a summoner/a blue mage/a corsair/a puppetmaster/a dancer/a scholar]...
15033 : If you're having trouble finding the person we're looking for, it's okay to give up for now, kupo.
15034 : Give up for now? That would be best. Not just yet!
15035 : Yeah, that's a tough one, kupo. But I have plenty of other presents here if you'd still like to help!
15036 : Hmmm...I don't think this is the person we're looking for, kupo.
15037 : Hmmm...this isn't the person we're looking for, kupo. But, you know what? I think something's coming back to me...
15038 : Oh, I stumbled across the present that was meant for the adventurer you brought with you, kupo!
15039 : Presents can be claimed using a card just like this! Have your adventurer friend show the card to a moogle and receive a wonderful gift, kupo!
15040 : Yes! This is the person I was looking for, kupo!
15041 : Hand this card to your friend. It can be given to a moogle in exchange for a present, kupo!
15042 : Your help was invaluable! Here, this is for you, kupo!
15043 : There are still so many presents to hand out, kupo! Don't be shy about lending another helping hand!
15044 : I'm so glad we found you! Here's your present, kupo!
15045 : What are you trying to pull, kupo!? Give this card to the person it's addressed to, and have them come to a moogle to receive a present!
15046 : One card at a time! I'm confused enough as it is, kupo!
15047 : This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where a Mog House has been prepared for your use.
15048 : This is the entrance to Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for your use.
15049 : A Mog House is a personal apartment that we've provided for your convenience.
15050 : Within your Mog House, you can carry out such activities as storing items, changing jobs, and healing HP and MP.
15051 : You are completely free to use the room as you see fit. Why, you can even arrange it to suit your own bad tastes.
15052 : Well, that put a damper on my day...
15053 : Can I help you?
15054 : The Mog Houses of the following party members are open for visits.
15055 : Come along then! Don't lag behind!
15056 : What do you wish to do? Nothing in particular. Ask for an explanation of Mog Houses. Visit the Mog House of a party member.
15057 : Whose Mog House will you visit? Never mind.
15058 : That Mog House is not currently open for visits.
15059 : Hello! Have you come to hear a tale?
15060 : I'm a storyteller, and I often entertain the children here with fantastic yarns and magical myths.
15061 : In fact, my audience should be here any moment if you've time to spare.
15062 : Today, I plan to read to them from an unusual book I borrowed from the library...
15063 : Ah, and here they are!
15064 : Are we ready to hear a delightful story about one of the plant people?
15065 : Yay! I want to know all about the plant people!
15066 : Hehehe. Well then, make yourself comfortable and I'll begin...
15067 : ...the tale of a young plant girl with a beautiful flower blooming from her head.
15068 : Ahem. The Adventures of Babban Ny Mheillea...
15069 : Once upon a time, a great comet appeared in the sky.
15070 : It was in this same age that an adorable mandragora girl arrived from across the vast ocean...
15071 : Her name was Babban Ny Mheillea.
15072 : She was traveling in search of the great plant city Netherstalk, said to lay hidden at the edge of the world.
15073 : Babban's dream was to marry the prince who lived in that city and live happily ever after.
15074 : She made many friends during her difficult journey.
15075 : The large, yet gentle Abenzio.
15076 : The elegant and fussy Lady Bryher.
15077 : The bright and cheerful Camlin.
15078 : And lastly, the aged and wise Darach, who claimed to have first sprouted in the very city Babban sought to find!
15079 : Unfortunately, Netherstalk was only a distant memory to Darach.
15080 : He had wandered outside as a tiny sapling and become hopelessly lost--the way back to the fabled city had completely faded from his mind.
15081 : These five plant people, joined through chance and happenstance...
15082 : ...began a long and hazardous journey to find the land of their dreams!
15083 : ...and thus the trials of the company ended in failure.
15084 : Perhaps Babban and her friends wander still, in search of their hearts' desire.
15085 : Yet the city they look for will never be found.
15086 : For the seeds of hope must be planted by the searchers...
15087 : ...and grown into a paradise of their own making.
15088 : Boo!
15089 : That doesn'taru make sense.
15090 : That can'taru be how the story ends...
15091 : This story really did end in failure.
15092 : Wait, wait. What happens next?
15093 : There is no next.
15094 : <Sigh>... I still have a long way to go...
15095 : A truly talented storyteller should be able to enthrall her audience no matter how unbelievable the tale.
15096 : The Adventures of Babban Ny Mheillea was written at the time of the Great War.
15097 : But I have to agree with the children that the story hasn't aged well.
15098 : I don't understand why someone would write an ending like that...
15099 : And that's not the only part that confuses me. See this chapter, here?
15100 : They meet a sapling in the Rolanberry Fields on their way to the Pashhow Marshlands...
15101 : But he's fried to a crisp by dragon fire before he has a chance to do anything.
15102 : This kind of harshness makes me think this is less of a fable...and more an account of events that actually took place.
15103 : Hehe. Now I'm just letting my imagination run away with me...
15104 : I still can't get The Adventures of Babban Ny Mheillea out of my mind.
15105 : The realistic harshness makes me wonder...
15106 : Could this fable be based on a true story...?
15107 : Hello! I was about to begin story time for the children.
15108 : It's the second half of a tale I began yesterday...
15109 : ...but you're welcome to stay and listen.
15110 : Are we all comfortable? Then let us continue with The Adventures of Babban Ny Mheillea...
15111 : After a grand and grueling adventure...
15112 : ...Babban and her friends finally arrived in the city of Netherstalk!
15113 : The mandragora girl met and married her mandragora prince.
15114 : They were blessed with three adorable sproutlings...
15115 : ...and they all lived happily ever after!
15116 : Boo!
15117 : Is that what we waitarued a whole day to hear?
15118 : No surprise-wises with that ending...
15119 : At least we know it's over now.
15120 : If I was a truly talented storyteller...
15121 : Excuse me...
15122 : I was wondering...
15123 : Didn't Babban promise to rrreward the sapling once she was married?
15124 : How did she rrreward [him/her]?
15125 : Oh, you have quite the memory for details, little one.
15126 : Well, Babban probably--
15127 : ...!?
15128 : Wh-what's going on!?
15129 : The Adventures of Babban Ny Mheillea...
15130 : ...was a true story?
15131 : W-was that the real Babban Ny Mheillea!?
15132 : It was almost as if she had met you before, %...
15133 : %...?
15134 : That's what they called the sapling!
15135 : You're right. You have the same name...
15136 : Wow! Did you go on all those adventures with the plant people?
15137 : Hehe, that's an amazing coincidence. Wouldn't it be wonderful if that sapling was really you...?
15138 : Hello, %!
15139 : Just you wait! One day I'll be the best storyteller this town has ever seen!
15140 : #, # #, #
15141 : Anxious 1.
15142 : Anxious 2.
15143 : Assured.
15144 : Celestial Nights has begun, kupo!
15145 : An event based on the timeless, tear-jerking tale of tragedy between Prince Yahiko of the Eastern Nation and Princess Amdina of the Western Nation is being held, kupo!
15146 : In an interpretive recreation of the tale, two actors have assumed the roles of the prince and princess on a sizzling hot date!
15147 : But all is not well...
15148 : You see, the town is overflowing with alluringly attractive ladies, kupo.
15149 : Why is that such a bad thing, you ask? By distracting the prince from giving his undivided attention to the princess, these vivacious vixens could ruin the event, kupo.
15150 : That must not be allowed to happen! If the actor in the prince's role threatens towards fickleness, it's your duty to slap him back to reality--literally!
15151 : And we can't forget about the actress playing the princess, either. She's under a lot of pressure to perform, and is prone to being plagued with severe self-doubt about her feelings towards her co-star, kupo.
15152 : Only with your moral support could she hope to maintain confidence and perform at her brilliant best. A simple nod would go a long way to reaffirm positive thoughts, while a shake of the head would do wonders to cast out negative ones, kupo!
15153 : And going back to the scandalous seductresses I mentioned earlier, you can prevent them from disrupting this royal rendezvous by turning their attention to you. A wave of the hand should do the trick, kupo!
15154 : Whatever happens, you must ensure that the date--the event--goes smoothly! I pray for your success on this most meaningful of missions, kupo!
15155 : Princess Amdina, mine one and only! I have so longed to once more behold thee! Thou art even more beautiful than when last we met!
15156 : Thy words pleaseth me, my sweet prince.  I, too, have ached to be by thy side again.
15157 : Let us make this a reunion that shall never be forgotten! Shall we, my princess?
15158 : Yes, my prince!
15159 : Prince Yahiko, pray forgive me my boldness...but there is something I desire.
15160 : Thou needest but name it, and thine it shall be! There is naught I would deny thee, apple of mine eye.
15161 : <Blush>... Even if thy heart is what I desire, my prince?
15162 : Hahaha! My princess, mine heart has been thine since the day I first laid mine eyes upon thee.
15163 : Prince Yahiko, pray tell me true... I would know why thou dost love me so.
15164 : To answer thy question fully is to tell a tale grander than the greatest epics. Thy beautiful almond eyes that glimmer brighter than the most precious jewels...thy voice of honey that resoundeth more sweetly than angel song...
15165 : Thine entire being is as a soothing spring rain that hath come to nourish the arid desert of my lonely existence.
15166 : <Blush>... My...my prince...I know not what to say...
15167 : Prince Yahiko?
15168 : What is it, my precious?
15169 : <Blush>... It...it is nothing...
15170 : Sweet princess, thou needest not hide anything from me.
15171 : Mmm, now that's my kind of guy. I'm gonna get me some of this!
15172 : Hey there, handsome! You got a little time to sparrre for a lonely girl like me?
15173 : A-and who dost thou assume to be?
15174 : (Of all the nerve! I'm not lettaruing you lay a finger on him, you feline floozie!)
15175 : Taint Prince Yahiko not with thy vile touch, hell-spawned grimalkin!
15176 : Geesh, what's your prrroblem? Can't a girl have any fun around here?
15177 : Yoo-hoo! This way, handsome.
15178 : Wh-what's this? My body moveth of its own accord? Pre...preposterous!
15179 : P-Prince Yahiko! Whither dost thou think...!
15180 : Fair maiden! As a moth fluttereth by the dancing flame of a lantern, so too am I powerless in thine intoxicating presence!
15181 : Awww, aren't you just the sweetest little thing! I can't rrresist a man who knows how to speak his mind.
15182 : V-variety...is the spice of life.
15183 : Egads! Perilously close was I to plunging into an abyss of bliss whence escape is impossible...
15184 : Awww, and I almost had him... But it ain't over yet, handsome!
15185 : Princess Amdina! My beloved! Please, find it in thy heart to forgive this foolish prince!
15186 : Hmph! <Sigh>... I believed thou wouldst return to me, my prince.
15187 : Never again shall I leave thy side! This, I swear upon mine honor!
15188 : Hm? Do I know you?
15189 : Do you mind? I'm trying to snag myself a prey of prrrincely proportion here.
15190 : You've caught me at a bad time. Why don't you be a good little adventurerrr and go whack some rarabs?
15191 : (Walking side by side with my co-star like this...it's as though we're really-weally a couple!)
15192 : (I've never thought to look at a colleague in this lightaru before, but he's dangerously close to being the man of my dreamy-weams.)
15193 : (Hmm...but that guy over there is more to my taste...)
15194 : (His portrayal of Yahiko's love and devotion for Amdina feels incredibly authentic. It's hard to believe that it's all just an actaru. Could it be that he's actually...smitten-witten with me?)
15195 : (How should I reply if he asks me out aftaru the event is over? Nooo, I need more time to thinky-wink over my answer!)
15196 : (Nah, he's just a decent actor, that's all. I have to give him some creditaru for that. Oh well...)
15197 : (All the men in Windurst will be like putty-wutty in my hands by the time this event is over. Teehee!)
15198 : (I can be so cold and heartless sometimes. Shamey-wame on me!)
15199 : (Hmm, where did all the guys disappear to? Talk about a disappointing turnoutaru...)
15200 : (He's so dreamy-weamy to look at from this angle. I could stare at his profile all day!)
15201 : (Aaah! Any more of this and my legs will turn into butter!)
15202 : (But, ewww... His frontage would certainly benefit from some renovation...)
15203 : (I've never feltaru so comfortable being with someone before. I wonder what this means...)
15204 : (Waaah! My poor little heart is beating like crazy-wazy! What's happening to me?)
15205 : (Well, after having rehearsed together for weeks on endy-wend, I suppose it's only natural.)
15206 : (If only a man--preferably a dark and handsome one--would bursty-wurst onto the scene and rescue me from my boredom...)
15207 : (Ugh... And I thought raising chocobos was a drag. A bit of unscripted excitementaru would be welcome right about now...)
15208 : (But then again, a scandalous episode wouldn't go down well with the agency.)
15209 : (This has been bothering me for a while, but how did a tiny Tarutaru like me ever-wever land the role of Princess Amdina?)
15210 : (Why, that would be because of your irresistible cuteness, silly!)
15211 : (They mightaru not be showing it, but I just know the townsfolk are ridiculing me behind my back...)
15212 : (Th-that girl--she was auditioning for the role of Princess Amdina alongside me! I knew I had seeny-ween her somewhere before. Hmm...the crowd seems to be paying more attention to her.)
15213 : (Snap out of it! I'm the one who was chosen to play the princess, not her! She may not be bad to look at, but there's little-wittle else that could be said in the positive.)
15214 : (Oh Goddess, I'm never-wever going to live this down...)
15215 : (The more I play the role of Princess Amdina, the more I find myself detestaruing her.)
15216 : (But this is probably-wobably just a skewed interpretation of her personality. I'll betaru she was a real sweetheart in real life.)
15217 : (It's such a chore trying to stay in character for a role you're averse to. I wish I hadn't auditioned.)
15218 : (I wish I could justaru enjoy the festival as one of the townsfolk. Maybe I could wrap up this shifty-wift a little early.)
15219 : (I can't believe I even considered playing hookey! An actress is nothing if not professional!)
15220 : (It shouldn't hurty-wurt to skip the next few lines. Yeah, I think I'll do that.)
15221 : (Oooh, the guy that walked by just now--if I could just tradey-wade linkpearls with him...)
15222 : Princess Amdina! Whither dost thou go?
15223 : Doth my presence...pleaseth thee no longer, my princess? If...if that is how it must be, I... <Sniff>....
15224 : (A-are those tears welling up in his puppy-wuppy-dog eyes!?)
15225 : N-never, my sweet prince! Thou art mine one and only delight! My mind but wandered in contemplation of what fate hath in store for the two of us!
15226 : Citizen, canst thou spare not the courtesy to allow the princess and I this rare private interlude?
15227 : There is not a single woman in the world who can rival the loveliness of my princess!
15228 : As long as I live, no harm shall ever befall the princess. This, I swear upon mine honor!
15229 : I can bear not even the thought of life without Princess Amdina.
15230 : Only with Princess Amdina doth my existence hold meaning.
15231 : There is not a single moment where the thought of Princess Amdina doth not occupy my mind!
15232 : Citizen, canst thou not see that I am attending to...official business?
15233 : My perfect prince... <Sigh>
15234 : The prince concealeth behind his majestic facade an innocent, childlike aspect that hath awakened my maternal instincts.
15235 : I had always been skeptical towards the idea of destiny. And then I met Prince Yahiko...
15236 : Even when we are far apart, the mere thought of the prince bringeth a comforting warmth to my soul.
15237 : <Sigh> How I hope that one day he will maketh me his bride...
15238 : Only I hold the key which unlocketh his soul!
15239 : I beseech thee, loyal citizen! Deliver the prince back to mine arms!
15240 : Hey therrre, [handsome/gorgeous]! Hope you're enjoying your stay in beautiful Windurst!
15241 : That's it. Any more thees and thous and I'm going to vomitaru.
15242 : Huh? I don't remember this being in the script...
15243 : I'm going home. Don't bother-wother to call me.
15244 : Wh-wh-what!?
15245 : Nooo! Princess Amdina! Don't leave me!
15246 : Prince Yahiko, I shall never forget our reunion this day.
15247 : Nor I, my dear princess.
15248 : It is our fervent hope that thou hast thoroughly enjoyed the Celestial Nights event.
15249 : We present this gift to thee, as a token of our gratitude for thine unrelenting support.
15250 : This year's Sunbreeze Festival has begun! A special show is being held at the town square as we speak, kupo!

15304 : Hello, faithful fans! Mighty Maiden Uka here!
15305 : Just by looking at your smiling faces, I can tell you're all having a great time at this year's Sunbreeze Festival! So, are you rrready for some music? I know we're ready to sing our hearrrts out!
15306 : ...Um, or at least I am. Where in sweet Selbina could Mumor be!?
15307 : Oh well, the show must go on. It's a little embarrassing to sing by myself, but any entertainer worth her miraclesalt would jump at this opporrrtunity. This is my chance to go solo!
15308 : Everyone, feast your earrrs upon my astounding aria.
15309 : Your cacophonous warbling is enough to make me vacate the contents of my stomach. These people are not stupid, either... They know that without your partner, you aren't even worth the stage on which you stand.
15310 : Who goes there!?
15311 : Who, indeed... Understandable, since I believe this is the first time I've deigned to grace you with my presence. I am a diva. Does that appellation ring any bells for you, pray tell?
15312 : A diva!? They truly exist!?
15313 : Oh, so you have indeed heard of my kind? No wonder you were once my master's favorite archfiend.
15314 : Though, in all truth, the title archfiend refers to nothing more than washed-up hacks who possess neither the drive nor the talent to reach for the stars...of divadom!
15315 : Yet now you've thrown even that away, settling for a mundane life of belching out dull drivel at vulgar venues. Someone as wretched as you holds no value whatsoever.
15316 : ...
15317 : Or do you...? I heard you associate with some upstart floozy who dares defy my master and dissuades archfiends from our cause. Do you know where she is?
15318 : Well, it seems you're all alone. No matter. She'll simply have to wait until I'm finished with you.
15319 : Cooome now, my preeecious!
15320 : Of course, someone of my sublime stature would never condescend to personally dispatch with a peon like you. This minion should prove more than a sufficient substitute for accomplishing that task.
15321 : The crowd here may be raucous, but drown out its pesky din. Now give yourself up to your dreams, just cast away your strife. Next, let your heavy eyelids fall and drool drip down your chin. This soothing, tranquil lullaby leaves all bereft of life.
15322 : Even without Mumor...I can cut this cocky diva down to size! Everyone, lend me your strength!
15323 : Yeep!
15324 : Hmph, it seems you may possess at least an iota of skill after all.
15325 : I'm not alone. I have the whole audience on my side! Let's do this, everyone!
15326 : Neo Crrrystal Jig!!!
15327 : Super Crrrusher Jig!!!
15328 : Shining Summerrr Samba!!!
15329 : Lovely Mirrracle Waltz!!!
15330 : Grrr...!
15331 : Don't just stand there and take it, you invariably incompetent imbecile!
15332 : Neo Crystal Jig!
15333 : Super Crusher Jig!
15334 : Shining Summer Samba!
15335 : Lovely Miracle Waltz!
15336 : Urk...!
15337 : Well now...
15338 : We must all work as one! Please, lend me your strrrength!
15339 : I-it can't be...
15340 : Ahahaha! Those earth tones truly do bring your outfit together, Uka.
15341 : You archfiends exist as nothing more than mere stepping stones on my path to glory! It matters not how many enemies assail me. I can dispatch them all with but the bat of an eye!
15342 : You may now exit stage right. Oh, and I don't think you'll need to worry about any encores.
15343 : Fear not, I'll be sure to invite your friend to the after-party as well!
15344 : Ahhhhhh!!!
15345 : Bwahahaha!!!
15346 : And so, without Mumor, Uka quickly succumbed to the diva and was banished to an interdimensional purgatory...
15347 : Be more supportive of her and you can overturn what has just transpired. Band together and cheer on Uka to save her from the diabolical diva!
15348 : Haaah, haaah... I've got to hand it to you. I don't think I can beat you by myself. If only Mumor were herrre, too.
15349 : Mumor? Oh, you mean that sorry excuse for a nemesis.
15350 : Just how might the addition of one more classless poseur change what is so obviously inevitable?
15351 : You certainly are persistent. My master must have seen... But enough chatter! This time I shall truly send you off into eternal slumber with a special lullaby.
15352 : In the name of joy and happiness, I shall punish you!
15353 : Mumor!
15354 : Please forgive me, Uka. I tried oh-so-hard not to be late!
15355 : You see, I was in a meeting with the produc-- I mean, I took too long deciding what to wear. Teehee!
15356 : A what with whom?
15357 : Hmmm? You must be hearing things. Who is this moogle, anyway?
15358 : Huh? Oh, yeah. She's a diva--one of Ullegore's songstrrresses--which means she has a much more talented voice than any of us forrrmer archfiends.
15359 : Another one? I'm sick and tired of Ullegore's lackeys trying to ruin our performances!
15360 : Ruin? Your act doesn't leave much to ruin. Besides, this stage was built for a diva of my caliber, not amateurs such as yourselves.
15361 : H-how dare you! My sultry singing is the perfect complement to Uka's dynamic dancing, and that's why our popularity soars higher than any airship!
15362 : Think what you will. We shall see if you're still singing the same tune after I show you how to hold a true note.
15363 : This is simply impossible! How can the addition of one saucy starlet change the tide of battle so?
15364 : I guess you haven't heard.
15365 : Mumor can absorrrb the energy from her cheerrring fans to unleash a devastating attack...
15366 : And when you add in Uka's Dancing Force...
15367 : Our power levels climb to over nine thousand!!!
15368 : P-power levels!? What sort of nonsense are you--
15369 : Let's play off this hoary old has-been before she even has a chance to butcher her swan song!
15370 : To see the inverted rainbow of your smile...
15371 : We'll dance to the abyss and back!
15372 : Mighty Maidens Mumor and Uka!
15373 : Eternal Vana Illusion!!!
15374 : Ahhh!
15375 : !?
15376 : Th-the demon king...
15377 : Ullegore!?
15378 : How nice to see you in such dire straits, Uka. And I would hardly be a demon king if I didn't extend the same greeting to my archnemesis. Now would I, Mumor?
15379 : However, it won't do for me to lose one of my precious divas. We beg your leave...but shall depart regardless of your answer.
15380 : Not so fast!
15381 : Don't you fret, my darling prima donna. We shall meet again, much to your chagrin.
15382 : Wherever there is a festival, I shall lurk amidst the shadows. I shall bide my time until the glorious day when I can extinguish every last festive flame, enshrouding Vana'diel in a tenebrous mantle of tedium and ennui!
15383 : Bwa, bwa, Bwahaha--hhhk...ack...ptewy...
15384 : What a stunning performance, Mighty Maidens!
15385 : Next time, you mightaru want to <mumble-mumble>...
15386 : And ye best git some rest while ye still can!
15387 : You don't need to tell us that twice!
15388 : You three have rrreally grown into your roles as gof...er, managerrrs. Keep up the good work!
15389 : We are wholly undeserving of such lofty praise. (We shall be the ones meting out empty compliments when Cream Puff's shining star eclipses you misnomered Mighty Maidens!)
15390 : Was that meant to be a backstage comment? Because even people all the way up in the gallery could hear it!
15391 : !?
15392 : Y-yikes! No curtain call for us this time!!!
15393 : We're so grateful to you, our devoted and trustworthy fans, for coming out and supporting us!
15394 : That diva may have backed us into a corner, but with you all behind us, there was no way we could lose!
15395 : That dastardly Ullegore best watch his back, too! The Mighty Maidens will put a stop to his tyranny of tedium once and for all!
15396 : Now delve into the myriad delights that the Sunbreeze Festival has to offer!
15397 : Uka Totlihn and %'s dancing synchronized!
15398 : Uka Totlihn is spurred on by the fireworks you bought! Your cheering will affect her more than ever!
15399 : ShowStep: #
15400 : Switch[OFF/ON]
15401 : Have your nights been feeling a little too dark and dreary lately? Then light them up with some fantastic fireworks, lovingly crafted by the two-and-only Mighty Maidens!
15402 : Come one, come all! Get your hands on the Mighty Maidens' new line of cheer-boosting, crrrowd-pleasing fireworks. They're grrreat fun for the whole family!
15403 : Thank you so much for patronizing our humble establishment! Note that the more fireworks you buy, the better the Mighty Maidens will perform against Ullegore and his minions! At this rate, they will perform like [tone-deaf Tonberries./over-hyped amateurs./fan favorites./superstars!/cultural icons!] Remember, your compassionate consumerism is key to restoring fun and felicity to the realm.
15404 : Kupo ho ho! The Starlight Celebration is once again upon us!
15405 : We moogles have spent many a sleepless night preparing for this year's festivities, kupo. Be sure not to miss any of the exceptionally exciting events that are being held in and about town during this most joyous of seasons.
15406 : Oh, and there's one thing you simply must know, kupo. Should you come by any gift tokens, bring them to me and I'll furnish you with gorgeous gifts in exchange!
15407 : Now, run along and immerse yourself in the revelry, kupo!
15408 : Ah, you've brought %! Here, this is for you!
15409 : Wow! That's quite a few gift tokens you have there, kupo!
15410 : If you're interested, I can exchange all the tokens you have for a grand gift of galactic proportion, kupo! Well, perhaps that's exaggerating things a tad.
15411 : Of course, it's perfectly permissible to use them one at time. The decision is entirely yours, kupo!
15412 : How many tokens will you exchange? The whole kaboodle! I'm a miser. Just the one, please.
15413 : That's the spirit, kupo! Here's a super-duper special gift for the [man/woman] who dared!
15414 : Sure thing, kupo. Here, this is your % in exchange.
15415 : Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight! As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for everyone, kupo.
15416 : For this year's Starlight Celebration, we moogles have set ourselves a challenge: breaking the all-Vana'diel present-distribution record! But we couldn't possibly dream of succeeding at such an ambitious undertaking just by ourselves, kupo.
15417 : We could really do with some adventurer-offered assistance. Would you be interested in lending a hand in this noble endeavor, in the spirit of giving, kupo?
15418 : Help the moogles? Sign me up! I'm a little busy, sorry.
15419 : We understand... But we'll be waiting right here if it turns out you can spare some time after all, kupo!
15420 : You've made this little moogle very happy, kupo! Now then, let's not waste any time. We'd like you to deliver these presents here.
15421 : The recipients are Kayeel-Payeel, Kenapa-Keppa, Honoi-Gomoi, and Angelica. Four people in total, kupo.
15422 : Report back to us after you've completed your task, kupo.
15423 : Also, we don't mind you working in a group if you feel lonesome doing the deliveries on your own. Just form a party and have everyone come talk to us.
15424 : And I have to warn you, presents can't be taken to other areas, kupo. Be careful, okay?
15425 : Happy delivering, kupo!
15426 : We want you to deliver the presents to Kayeel-Payeel, Kenapa-Keppa, Honoi-Gomoi, and Angelica. Four people in total, kupo.
15427 : You've yet to deliver presents to [Kayeel-Payeel,/Kenapa-Keppa,/Honoi-Gomoi,/Angelica,] [Kayeel-Payeel,/Kenapa-Keppa,/Honoi-Gomoi,/Angelica,] and [Kayeel-Payeel,/Kenapa-Keppa,/Honoi-Gomoi,/Angelica,] kupo.
15428 : You've yet to deliver presents to [Kayeel-Payeel,/Kenapa-Keppa,/Honoi-Gomoi,/Angelica,] and [Kayeel-Payeel,/Kenapa-Keppa,/Honoi-Gomoi,/Angelica,] kupo.
15429 : You've yet to deliver a present to [Kayeel-Payeel,/Kenapa-Keppa,/Honoi-Gomoi,/Angelica,] kupo.
15430 : Wow, you've delivered every single present! Thank you so much, kupo!
15431 : Here's a little something for your kindness.
15432 : You want to help us again? That's very kind of you, but we need more time to put together a new set of presents, kupo. Would you mind coming back tomorrow?
15433 : The Starlight Celebration, you say?  Hmph. I have no interest in such frivolities...but I'll keep the present anyway.
15434 : Thank...you...for...lovely... ...Starlight...Celebration...present...
15435 : Eh? You presume to give this pathetic excuse for a Starlight Celebration present to me, the insanely well-to-do Honoi-Gomoi!? Hmph, I'll accept it, but only because you're being so stubborn about it.
15436 : Huh? Is this present, like, for me? Truly? I'm, like, totally over the moon right now! My next masterpiece is sooo going to be themed on the Starlight Celebration.
15437 : Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight! As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for all adventurers, kupo.
15438 : We'd appreciate your help in distributing the presents. What say you?
15439 : Help the moogles? But of course! I help no one but myself.
15440 : You're truly a role model for all adventurers, kupo! Now then, we'd like you to take this card and give it to a [male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer.
15441 : If you happen to forget who the card's recipient is, just show it to me, kupo.
15442 : Let' see... This addressee of this card is a [male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer, kupo.
15443 : Are you trying to pull a fast one, kupo!? This card isn't yours to give, nor is it addressed to you, so please take it back to where you found it.
15444 : Ah, you've brought us a card! Here's a present in exchange for it, kupo.
15445 : We'd also appreciate your help in distributing cards, kupo. All you're required to do is deliver this card to the addressee. We're counting on you!
15446 : Things have settled down for the time being. But we may have need for your help later on, so don't wander too far away, kupo.
15447 : Greetings, friend! I am a synergy engineer, dispatched from the Institute to maintain the furnaces you see beside me. I also have knowledge and services to share with fellow synergists, if that is what you desire.
15448 : I see from the puzzled expression on your face that you are unfamiliar with our discipline. To use these furnaces, you will first need to obtain %.
15449 : Piqued your curiosity, have I? Then you should speak with Hildolf, our institute director, at his laboratory in the Bastok Metalworks. He's always eager to welcome a new synergist to our ranks.
15450 : May I be of service? Not now. Learn recipes. Check fewell. Replenish fewell. Purchase materials. Receive training. Trade cinder. Get information.
15451 : Recipes, you say? Let's see what we have that's suitable for your level of expertise...
15452 : ...I'm sorry. I'm afraid there's nothing I can teach you at the moment.
15453 : I've got it! How about %? Mind you, it'll require a certain level of skill...

15472 : There you go. That doesn't sound so hard, now, does it?
15473 : But of course! If you'll just allow me to inspect your % for a moment...
15474 : Your fewell supply would appear to be as follows: # # # # # # # #.
15475 : Running low? We can fill you up for a nominal fee.
15476 : Replenish fewell? Yes. No.
15477 : Looking for a fewell fill-up, you say? Then you've come to the right place!
15478 : ...Hm? Why, your tank is already full to bursting. Come back again if you need a refill.
15479 : Now let's see here... According to my calculations, I can fill you up to capacity for # gil.  How does that sound?
15480 : Pay # gil? Deal! No thanks.
15481 : Understood. Take care to monitor your reserves closely, lest you run out of fewell in the midst of a crucial procedure.
15482 : I'm afraid you haven't the requisite gil, friend. Perhaps another time.
15483 : Excellent! Now we just pop open your % here, and...
15484 : There you go. Filled to the brim with a fresh batch of fewell! Can you smell those fumes? Mmm-mmm!
15485 : Your % has been filled to capacity!
15486 : You hand the synergy engineer # gil.
15487 : How do you expect me to do that when your % is sitting inside a furnace, friend? You'll have to come back after you've finished synergizing.
15488 : Materials, you say? But of course! Have a look at our selection.
15489 : Purchase something? Not today. # %: # gil. # ): # gil. # ): # gil.
15490 : For # %, that comes to # gil.
15491 : Ah, another dedicated synergist looking to refine [his/her] technique. Excellent! That motivation will serve you well.
15492 : ...But I'm afraid you'll need [/ever so slightly more/a bit more/more/a good deal more/considerably more] experience before you're ready to benefit from my training.
15493 : And yes, it would seem you're at just the right skill level to receive my training. So, what will it be? Which technique would you like to improve?
15494 : Train in which technique? Cancel. Fewell feeding. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace thwacking. (Current Lv.: #) Pressure handle. (Current Lv.: #) Safety lever. (Current Lv.: #) Furnace repair. (Current Lv.: #) Fewell recycling. (Current Lv.: #)
15495 : You wish to improve your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique. Is this correct?
15496 : It would seem your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique already exceeds my own. There is no more I can teach you.
15497 : Train in this technique? Yes. No.
15498 : Very well! Now listen up, watch closely, and try to follow along...
15499 : ...See, you take this part here, and... Yes, yes...just like that...
15500 : ...Now steady here, or you'll be picking exploded furnace shrapnel out of your face for a week! Phew, that was a close one...
15501 : ...And by applying Corollary Five of Hildolf's Third Theory of Inverse Transfocal Equilibrium, we find that...
15502 : <Clink, clank...clunk> ...Er, let's try that once more...
15503 : ...Superb! A quick learner, I see. If only all my students were as attentive as you!
15504 : Your [/fewell feeding/furnace thwacking/pressure handle operation/safety lever operation/furnace repair/fewell recycling] technique increases to level #!
15505 : Research into the composition of the cinder produced as a side effect of synergy just might lead to the next breakthrough in our field. Provide us with samples for analysis, and we will gladly reward your contributions.
15506 : Trade in your cinder? (Currently: # Pz) Not now. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. %: # Pz. # gil: # Pz.
15507 : This is what you want, correct?
15508 : Make the exchange? Yes. No.
15509 : It would appear that you lack the necessary quantity of cinder for that transaction.
15510 : Excellent! And this is yours. May it serve you well!
15511 : You transferred # Pz of cinder to the synergy engineer. # Pz [remains/remain] in your possession.
15512 : Ask about what? Nothing. Synergy furnaces. Synergy overview. Synergy procedure. Synergy recipes. Fewell replenishment. Materials for sale. Synergy techniques. Trading cinder.
15513 : The synergy furnaces you see around town are provided as a public service by the Bastokan Institute of Synergy Research, to ensure that no synergist is ever far away from the tools of their trade.
15514 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Provided those conditions are met, synergy furnaces may be used free of charge.
15515 : Needless to say, only one party may operate any given furnace at once.
15516 : Fortunately, there are multiple furnaces installed throughout town. If the furnace before you is already in use, please seek out an unused one elsewhere, or wait patiently for your turn.
15517 : You may think of synergy as an evolved form of synthesis. It is a discipline full of heretofore unimagined possibilities, but one which demands consummate skill from its practitioners.
15518 : Like synthesis, synergy involves combining materials according to a prescribed recipe to yield oft-spectacular results. The rub is that each synergy recipe also dictates a certain elemental balance that must be achieved for the procedure to be successful.
15519 : This balance is achieved through skillful infusion of combustible elemental crystals that we synergists call fewell. To begin the synergy process, you'll have to feed the furnace with fewell and get those flames burning!
15520 : As a general rule, the more complex the recipe, the more fewell it will require. Take care to check your stock before you fire up the furnace, lest you find its flames guttering out at a crucial moment.
15521 : With the belly of the furnace roaring up a storm, it's time to toss in your materials and start synergizing! Keep a close eye on the balance of elements and deploy fewell as necessary. Approach the prescribed elemental balance, and your item will take form, allowing you to remove it from the furnace.
15522 : The closer you are to the ideal elemental balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be. In synergy, it pays to be a perfectionist!
15523 : But be forewarned: these furnaces can only sustain the elemental maelstrom swirling and storming inside them for so long.
15524 : If the furnace's durability should fail, the synergy process will be interrupted, and you will be forced to start anew.
15525 : Take heart, though, as any materials inside your % will remain intact. You may retrieve them or attempt the synergy process again as you see fit.
15526 : Any fewell consumed in the failed synergy attempt, on the other hand, will be permanently lost.
15527 : Synergists must also be wary of debris buildup, an unavoidable side effect of the volatile elemental reactions that take place within the synergy furnace.
15528 : Should too much debris be allowed to accumulate, the contents of the furnace will become unstable, potentially leading to unpleasant explosions and eruptions. Such accidents pose considerable risk to the synergy attempt in progress, as well as the physical well-being of the synergist, so be sure to exercise due caution!
15529 : You may be asking yourself, Why, how in the name of Hildolf am I going to oversee all of these complicated procedures and variables by myself?
15530 : Here's the good news: you don't have to! For you see, synergy furnaces are designed for use by multiple operators.
15531 : The more complex the recipe, the greater level of skill and hands-on manipulation it will demand. At such times, it would be in your best interest to seek out like-minded synergists and take on the challenge together.
15532 : Finally, it would be remiss of me not to make mention of %, the curious substance whose properties are only now--with the emergence of synergy--becoming known to us.
15533 : Though there is much yet to be learned, our research has revealed that % may be used to bolster your equipment, if attached in a proper manner.
15534 : Mind you, % is not easy to come by, and I can offer no clues as to where or how to obtain it. Should you be fortunate enough to come across some in your travels, however, I encourage you to explore its potential.
15535 : Synergy is not a discipline for the faint of heart or mind, but with dedication and cooperation, there are great rewards to be reaped. May your career as a synergist prove fruitful!
15536 : First, you'll be wanting to check your fewell supply. You may do so by speaking with a synergy engineer such as myself, or by examining a synergy furnace.
15537 : You'll be needing at least one unit of fewell for each element dictated by your recipe. Without this, even the most skilled synergist cannot hope to succeed.
15538 : Should your fewell supply be in order, it's time to proceed with the synergy. If you are using one of these public synergy furnaces here, you'll need to examine it and lay claim to its use.
15539 : You may then deposit your ingredients. Should they correspond to a proper recipe, the synergy furnace will fire up automatically. Note that as a safety precaution, the furnace will not activate if the recipe is beyond your level of synergy skill.
15540 : From here, it becomes a race against the clock! Through skilled operation of the synergy furnace, you must achieve the elemental balance prescribed by the recipe before the furnace's durability fails.
15541 : Fortunately, synergy furnaces are outfitted with a wide array of features designed to aid the synergist in this demanding task. First, you'll want to confirm the current balance of elements within the furnace and compare it to your desired result.
15542 : Next, you can begin to feed fewell into the furnace to gradually raise the level of elemental concentration. Feeding fewell into the furnace until the required elemental balance is achieved is the most fundamental operation of synergy.
15543 : However, high concentrations of elemental power can lead to volatile and unpredictable reactions. Simply adding fewell haphazardly without making the necessary adjustments is a recipe for only one thing, and that's disaster.
15544 : If you sense that the furnace is on the verge of elemental overload, you'll want to employ the safety lever and pressure handle to prevent an unfortunate accident from occurring.
15545 : You'll also want to mind the laws of elemental ascendancy and opposition. Increasing the concentration of a particular element will cause its counterpart to decrease.
15546 : The furnace cannot sustain its power indefinitely, and will gradually lose durability as the synergy process continues. You'll need to perform periodic furnace repair should the furnace near its breaking point.
15547 : It is also possible to recycle strewn fewell during synergy. While this will not impact the success or failure of the process itself, it will result in a greater amount of salvageable cinder produced as a by-product.
15548 : This cinder is of great interest to our researchers back at the institute. As such, we have introduced a reward system through which quality samples can be traded in for an assortment of synergy-related wares.
15549 : As marvelous an apparatus as the synergy furnace may be, keep in mind that the technology is still in its infancy, and highly unstable. There may be times when accidents occur despite the best efforts of the synergist.
15550 : For your safety, we recommend stepping as far away from the furnace as possible at the first sign of danger. Some synergists claim that giving the furnace a good thwack is also effective in preventing such accidents, but this is pure madness, if you ask me!
15551 : You will also find that there are numerous techniques that can be applied to make the synergy procedure go even more smoothly.
15552 : In many cases, expertise and knowledge acquired through crafting will serve you in synergy as well. To truly master synergy, one must master crafting as well.
15553 : Now let us return to the synergy process itself. As your elemental balance approaches that prescribed by the recipe, the furnace will signal you, and you may retrieve your finished product.
15554 : If the furnace is still holding strong at this time, you may choose to keep working to achieve an even closer balance. The closer you come to the ideal balance, the higher the quality of your finished product will be.
15555 : Indeed, many synergy masters consider these waning moments after the signal to be the time to really show off their skills! Why, if they manage to achieve an elemental surge...
15556 : What's an elemental surge, you ask? Why, it's a miraculous phenomenon that occurs rarely--ever so rarely--upon feeding the furnace fewell.
15557 : The elements react just in the right way, creating a miraculous reaction that brings the level of elemental concentration to exactly the desired level. Truly a boon from the Goddess for any synergist, no?
15558 : ...And that is the synergy process in a nutshell. There's quite a bit of information to take in, so don't hesitate to return any time for a refresher course.
15559 : Much like synthesis, to fashion items through synergy, you will need to follow a recipe. We synergy engineers are always unearthing new recipes, and are happy to share with you those suitable for your level of skill.
15560 : Unlike synthesis, however, a synergy recipe is more than just a list of ingredients. There is also a required elemental balance that must be attained to achieve your desired result.
15561 : Simple recipes involve only small doses of a limited number of elements, but more complex ones require the synergist to skillfully juggle wide ranges of elements in extremely high concentrations.
15562 : The ingredients, you will have to remember on your own. The required elemental balance, however, may be reviewed at any time during the synergy process by observing the readings on the synergy furnace.
15563 : In particular, recipes through which the curious substance known as % can be attached to equipment are creating quite a buzz among synergistically inclined adventurers these days.
15564 : % cannot be attached directly. First, equipment must be prepared by etching an aperture into which an elementally compatible piece of % can then be embedded.
15565 : The type of aperture that may be etched will depend on the piece of equipment. There are also pieces of equipment that, alas, may not be modified at all.
15566 : If you are curious what manner of aperture may be etched into a particular piece of equipment, you need only trade it to me or one of my colleagues.
15567 : As a general rule, the higher the level of the item in question, the more difficult the synergy process for creating an aperture will be.
15568 : You will find that certain pieces of equipment may be etched with multiple apertures. It is, however, only possible to create one aperture at a time.
15569 : Etching requires the use of a corrosive substance we call mordant. Deposit mordant into a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and the process will begin.
15570 : My colleagues and I have a stock of mordant available for sale. The best way to learn is to practice, so if you're curious, we encourage you to purchase some and begin experimenting!
15571 : The difficulty of the synergy process when embedding evolith is decided by a number of factors.
15572 : Such factors include the variety of aperture and evolith, as well as the quantity of evolith you seek to attach. Embedding the first piece is not too difficult a task, but the second and third pieces will not go in so easily.
15573 : To begin the embedding process, deposit your evolith into the synergy furnace along with a piece of equipment with a compatible aperture.
15574 : When etching or embedding, the required elemental balance may be confirmed at any time during the synergy process, so let this be your guide.
15575 : Should you ever wish to remove any apertures and embedded evolith from a piece of equipment entirely, you may do so with an ingredient we call revertant.
15576 : Toss the revertant in a synergy furnace along with your equipment, and its potent powers will restore your item to a pure and pristine state! Be warned, however, that embedded evolith will be lost forever in the process.
15577 : As you are no doubt already aware, synergy makes use of a highly combustible form of elemental crystals that we call fewell. The more complex the recipe, the greater the quantity of fewell required.
15578 : Veteran synergists know well the hassle of having to constantly monitor their fewell supply and procure crystals to replenish depleted stock.
15579 : To free you of such trifling burdens and allow you to focus your mind entirely on your art, we synergy engineers are offering a convenient fewell replenishment service!
15580 : For a nominal fee calculated based upon the current state of your fewell reserves, we will instantly refill you to full capacity.
15581 : That's right--all elements in one simple transaction, directly to your %! What could be easier?
15582 : Looking to fire up your furnace and enter the world of %? If so, you've come to the right place!
15583 : We're proud to offer a supply of the corrosive agent known as mordant for sale. With this, synergy newcomers can hone their skills and outfit their equipment with evolith-capable apertures in the process.
15584 : Mind you, our stock is limited to only the most diluted, readily produced form of the stuff. You'll find that it only has the strength to etch items of relatively low level.
15585 : Etching high-powered equipment requires the use of more concentrated and potent forms of mordant. As quantities are limited, we can offer these only in exchange for cinder.
15586 : Ah, synergy techniques! Those handy tricks of the trade that can mean the difference between a shiny new item and a major furnace meltdown.
15587 : My colleagues and I are always eager to train fellow synergists in a wide range of techniques. We can't do it all, though--you'll need to hone your synergy skill in order to benefit from our instruction.
15588 : Bear in mind that certain techniques can only be imparted to students possessing specialized crafting knowledge. For example, only skilled smiths will be able to comprehend the method for more efficient fewell feeding.
15589 : Accomplished goldsmiths will be able to observe the inner workings of the furnace and stave off potential accidents. You will find that all crafting skills--even those you may not expect--may be applied in some way to support the synergy process.
15590 : Word has it that there are also pieces of equipment that can impart hidden synergy techniques to the wearer. These, too, are said to be only accessible to skilled crafters.
15591 : The moral of the story is this: while synergy skill is important, neglect not your other crafting skills. To become a true synergy master, finding the proper balance is key.
15592 : Synergy remains a young discipline, and researchers back at the institute are burning the midnight fewell in the hopes of uncovering the next breakthrough in our field.
15593 : Research of late is centered around the cinder that is left behind as a by-product of each synergy operation. Their composition, it would seem, has much to teach us of the true nature of the complex elemental reactions that go on within the bellies of these furnaces.
15594 : We've even instituted a reward program for adventurers willing to contribute prime samples in the name of science.
15595 : It would be no exaggeration to say that, to us, cinder is worth more than its weight in gold! Bring it to me or my colleagues--preferably in large quantities--and you're sure to be pleased at what we can offer you in return.
15596 : Wondering if your % can be outfitted with evolith, are you? Well, you've come to the right place!
15597 : A quick look at its composition should tell us all we need to know. Let's see here...
15598 : Congratulations! Your % can indeed hold [an/another] evolith aperture. A %-shaped aperture, to be exact...
15599 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following size and elemental affinity: Maximum size: # / [///////].
15600 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
15601 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
15602 : ...Suitable for evolith of the following sizes and elemental affinities: Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////]. Maximum size: # / Affinity: [///////].
15603 : That is all. Should you wish to have any other pieces of equipment analyzed, you know where to find us.
15604 : Hmm... I'm afraid your % cannot house any more apertures.
15605 : ...Alas. It's a shame, but it appears your % cannot be etched.
15606 : Hmm, what's this? It would seem that your % cannot be etched at this time.
15607 : Do you love synergizing as much as I love synergizing!? 'Cause if you do, you're gonna loooooove the recipes I have for you!

15610 : View which recipe? ([Amateur/Recruit/Initiate/Novice/Apprentice/Journeyman/Craftsman/Artisan/Adept/Veteran], p. #). None. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Return to page selection. Previous page. Next page.
15611 : Oh, the %? Why, that's one of my favorite recipes, too! What skills does it require? Let's see here...
15612 : Well, look at this. All you need is a furnace and your own Goddess-given synergy skills to make that one! Ain't synergy grand?
15613 : Wait! No, don't tell me. You strike me as a [man/woman] who's looking to learn a thing or two about synergy.
15614 : Learn about synergy? Not today. Teach me! Just give me %.
15615 : A life without intellectual curiosity is a life hardly worth living. Should your eyes one day open to this truth, you are free to return.
15616 : I thought you'd never ask! Synergy is both an art and a science: an evolution--nay, a revolution--in synthesis.
15617 : Using % in conjunction with a synergy furnace--the apparatus you see beside me--the synergist wields the power of myriad elements to fabricate a veritable host of potent items.
15618 : What we call % serves to dispense fewell crystals--the lifeblood of the synergy process--whilst also protecting its contents from the volatile reactions that occur within the bowels of the furnace.
15619 : Synergy furnaces have been installed throughout the city for the use of all synergists. The crucible is sufficiently compact and lightweight that you can carry it with you.
15620 : Initiating the synergy process is as simple as inserting your % into a furnace and commencing the infusion of elemental fewell.
15621 : Needless to say, what will happen from there is not quite so simple.
15622 : Successful synergy is contingent upon maintaining elemental equilibrium. The prescribed ratio, of course, will vary depending on the artifact you are attempting to create.
15623 : You can increase the ratio of a particular element by burning the corresponding variety of fewell.
15624 : But herein lies the rub: synergy is a still young science, and the technology we employ remains, shall we say...unstable.
15625 : A bit too much fewell here, a wrong lever pulled there, and the percolating pot will explode, spitting scalding elemental guck every which way to Firesday.
15626 : That's why smart synergists synergize in numbers. Too many culinarians might spoil the broth, but when it comes to synergy, it's the more the merrier!
15627 : An aspiring synergist, I see! If you're looking for %, you've certainly come to the right place.
15628 : I can sell you a splendid entry-level model for # gil. A small price to pay to embark on a lifelong journey of scientific discovery, wouldn't you say?
15629 : # gil, paid in full!
15630 : As promised, here's your %. And because I like your enthusiasm, I've even stocked it to the brim with fewell for you! How's that for a deal?
15631 : The synergist must provide his or her own %, as well as any materials to be used in the synergy process. Synergy furnaces themselves may be used free of charge.
15632 : Should you wish to learn more about the science of synergy, seek out one of the engineers stationed throughout the town.
15633 : A super-special Starlight Celebration to you, ambitious adventurer!
15634 : What am I saying!? This is hardly the time for gleeful greetings or alliterative addresses, kupo!
15635 : Even as we speak, overzealous Goblins are partaking not just in the Starlight Celebration spirit, but others' precious presents! These Gobbies bear no bad blood, but their covetous capers are the cause of much consternation, kupo.
15636 : And to make matters worse, they've even filched the furnishings the MHMU ordered from the guilds... I know the saying, If you give a Goblin goulash... but this is just rikupulous!
15637 : Please, %, I beseech you! Find the Goblins traipsing about town and teach them the meaning of private property once and for all! (By affably asking them to relinquish what they requisitioned, kupo.)
15638 : It may seem like the MHMU is just exploiting the nearest adventurer, but nay! You--and only you--are capable of restoring resplendence and revelry to the realm. Now go forth and fulfill the festive fate we thrust upon you, kupo!
15639 : Kupopopo! Have you forgotten your merry mission already? Get giddy, gift-grabbing Goblins around town to give back people's goods, then go gab to a Moogle when you're done.
15640 : And remember, Gobbies like to stick their noses in other creatures' business, if you know what I mean. Snuff out your smell so they can't sense your spoils, kupo.
15641 : And remember, Goblins go cuckoo for comestibles, kupo. Offer them their favorite food, for they should forget you even exist.
15642 : And remember, Goblins just want to jump for joy and jubilation at this jocular time of year. Bequeath beastmen bills or bedazzling bijoux to them and you may find yourself furnished with furnishings in return, kupo.
15643 : Great glorious Goddess, you've managed to procure a present! Praise be to your positively prodigious persistence! ...And your altruistic attitude after you return it to its rightful remitter, kupo!
15644 : It looks like this gift is from someone named %. Seek out the sender and start spreading some Starlight spirit, kupo! Oh, and watch out for mischievous Goblin mitts, my little gofer--I mean adventurer!
15645 : Wonderful work, warden of weal! However, since giving is greater than receiving, how about giving % word that you were able to deliver the present?
15646 : The considerable amount of charity you've shown complete strangers cannot be overstated, kupo. Without your magnanimity, moxie, and master mediation skills, this year's Starlight Celebration would have been a much dimmer affair.
15647 : Yet to polish this party to the point of pristine luster, more Goblins must be taught the difference between naughty and nice! Remember, once you give back a gift, seal the deal by simply sauntering over to the nearest moogle. We're counting on you, kupo!
15648 : The MHMU humbly offers you this token of our thanks, not only for making the world a brighter place, but for tolerating our moogle mummery and the voluminous vats of verbosity that violated your virgin ears.
15649 : Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I forgot those festive Gobbies are still frolicking with our furnishings, kupo!
15650 : I'm so sorry to solicit further favors from you, but could you kindly retrieve those as well? Pretty please with paprika on top? You wouldn't want to keep us from rewarding the good boys and girls of Vana'diel, would you, kupo?
15651 : Kupo ho ho! Do my deteriorating eyes deceive me, or is that one of the furnishings we ordered? We'd planned on giving them all to needy orphans, but you've done so much for the MHMU recently, why don't you have this one? 'Tis the season, so they say.
15652 : What an astounding accomplishment, as expected of an adventurer like you! We are eternally grateful for the copious kindnesses you've conferred upon us, kupo.
15653 : Word around the union fountain is that other nations' furnishings still remain at large. Would it be too terrible a torment to traipse around town--peepers peeled for gregarious Gobbies ogling purported presents--the next time you visit another nation? The MHMU would be forever in your debt, kupo.
15654 : (Wheeew, way to whisk that one under the rug. I could never tell [him/her] that we got distracted by the dazzling decorations and had the furnishings nabbed from nigh under our noses!)
15655 : Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?
15656 : Ev'ry girl, ev'ry boy, ev'rybody, happy toy! Me nose holes smell the joy, The joy from happy toy! Wheeere cooould iiit beee?
15657 : This for me? In-doo-bid-ably! Could be gooder, but it not bad.
15658 : Waaah! It you! You give yum-yums for me tum-tum. Good [guy/girl]!
15659 : Not for us, not for me? I give it back. Now you happy? Happy toy, happy toy, where be me happy toy?
15660 : No no no no no! Go away! Nose holes busy sniff for happy toy!
15661 : ...
15662 : You have friend, you do? We Gobbies have friend too.
15663 : Yum-yums for me? Gobbies remember...till our tummies go rumble-rumble again.
15664 : For me!? Why give so nice thing to me!? Me so happy head go boom! So boom! But first, me need give happy toy to you too.
15665 : Happy toy? For me? Why you give so good thing to me? But no can take. Me have no happy toy for you.
15666 : Blech. What this yucky thing? It make me want upgut food. Take it away.
15667 : What? But how...? If that's truly from %, that must mean...you stole it and you're ransoming it back to me! If you think for one moment that I'd pay scum like you, you'd best think twice!
15668 : Oh, I see. My apologies. How silly of me. Everyone knows how mischievous Goblins get during the Starlight Celebration season. I read somewhere that it's got something to do with the moon and the tides or whatnot.
15669 : Anyway, sorry to trouble you, but could you deliver this in my stead? I may look like a strapping young lad, but I have this illness that prevents me from doing the same task twice in one day. Quite troublesome, really.
15670 : Also, could you do me a favor and report back to me after you're done? I didn't want to spend the extra gil for delivery confirmation with times as tough as they are, you know?
15671 : I take it you delivered my present safe and sound? Oh, and it was well received, too? Ha, you didn't need to tell me that, for my gifts are always a hit. I guess I should thank you though, seeing as how you played a tiny part in my Starlight Celebration success.
15672 : Waaah, a cutthroat! Take anything you want, just not my lucky chocobo hose, please! I... Wait, isn't that the gift I sent %? You didn't steal that too, did you!?
15673 : What!? You...valiantly wrested it from the clutches of a greedy Goblin so you could return it to me? I just knew my [handsome champion/fair handmaiden] in resplendent regalia would come some day!
15674 : I'm sure you've been through quite a few trials and tribulations just getting this back to me, your fair lady. However, my hands are tied at the moment and I can't take this present to %. Therefore, I command you, my loyal follower, to act as my liaison and deliver it unscathed. I have no doubt that you'll succeed, since a [knight/handmaiden] will do anything to serve and protect [his/her] mistress.
15675 : And please don't forget to check in with me after the delivery is made. Every [champion/handmaiden] knows that's the [chivalrous/proper] thing to do.
15676 : How fared your journey, my [courageous champion/humble handmaiden]? Oh, I simply knew I could place my complete trust in you! You've not only made your fair lady quite proud, but saved the Starlight Celebration from those covetous beastmen! Oh, joyous day!
15677 : I beg your pardon, but I cannot help but notice that this is the parcel I sent to %. How might you have come by it?
15678 : Ah, I see. Those Goblin rapscallions still show a complete and utter disregard for social graces, would you not agree? At any rate, you seem to possess a rather strong sense of justice, and for that I am most grateful.
15679 : Could you also find it within your heart to see that this package reaches % safely? I may be a man of humble means, but you will certainly have my eternal gratitude and undying admiration.
15680 : Oh my. This utterly slipped my addled mind. I am truly sorry, but I fear I must heap one more request upon your already burdened back. Could you please report back to me after you've made the delivery? It would undoubtedly lessen the anxiety weighing down my fragile heart.
15681 : Goddess be good, you have returned! And with favorable tidings, no? Splendid. Absolutely splendid. Thanks to you, I feel as if I could burst into a Starlight carol at any moment. Fa-la-la-la.
15682 : What doth bring thee 'fore these rheumy eyes, orbs that pierce the soul and a stranger's guise? Harken, thou hast %'s present, from whom hast thou received such consent?
15683 : 'Tis an entertaining tale with which thy jowls doth flail, A tale of Goblins run amok, and wretched me bereft of luck. Still, thanks are in store for completing this chore with a dearth of gore.
15684 : While these next words may conjure a storm, I cannot assist thee in any form. Thus, I entreat thee to heed the call...deliver this gift to % once and for all!
15685 : 'Fore I finish this lengthy tirade, one last request must be made. Once the gift hath changed hands, return at once for further plans.
15686 : Thou hast safely returned from thy trial? Upon us both doth Altana smile! To thee, the savior of the Starlight Celebration, I do give heartfelt acclamations!
15687 : Wh-wh-what have you got there? It looks awfully-wafully like the gift I gave to %. Did something happen? P-p-please don't tell me that % passy-wassed away!
15688 : ...It was just a G-g-goblin prank? Sorry to overreactaru. I had a t-t-traumatic experience last Starlight Devastation--er, Celebration! So now I always feary-wear the worst. By the way, th-th-thank you for getting my gift back.
15689 : As you can guess, m-m-my comfort zone is rather itty-bitty. I know you must be expired--tired! But can you please helpy-welp me and deliver my present to %?
15690 : After you pass on--the gift! Pass the gift on! Then c-c-could you report back to me? I truly-wuly want to know how % reacts.
15691 : Ah, you're back! It's %'s most perished, er, cherished possession, you say? Wh-wh-what lofty-wofty praise! I can't thank you enough for your c-c-contributions, adventurer.
15692 : So many nasty-wasty things happened to me today, I'm just too moody-woody to listen to your blather! Begone before I--wait, isn't that my present to %?
15693 : Ugh, quit barking like a bog dog, [brother-wother/sister-wister]! I don't give a ham and cheese about giddy Goblins or lazy moogles.
15694 : You think you're so great because you saved my present from some baddie-waddies? Bah humbug-wumbug! If you're gonna stick your nosey-wose in others' business, then you bettaru finish what you started! You'll be taking that gift on over to %, I tell you what!
15695 : And don't think for a minute-winute that I'm going to let you get away with ruining my day! Report back here for a tongue-lashing when you're done! Now get going before I gutaru you right here and now!
15696 : Hmph, so you're stupid as well as rude? Are you so subservient that you'd actually come backy-wack for a beating? Get out of my face! You disgustaru me. Oh, and Merry Starlight!
15697 : Hey, I sent that to %. Why do you have it?
15698 : Hmmm. Stolen by Gobbies, huh? Thanks for getting it back.
15699 : Sorry to burden you, but could you bring it to % again for me?
15700 : Also, I'd like it if you could please fill me in when you're done.
15701 : I see you've returned. Mmm...that's good news indeed. Thank you for the kindness you've shown me and my friend.
15702 : What have we here? A cat burrrglar? How dare you despoil the innocent people of our fair nation!
15703 : What am I talking about? That's the prrresent I sent %! How could you have it if you didn't steal it!?
15704 : Oh, I see. You're a defender of justice too. Good job negotiating with those Goblin scum. I just hope that rrrepeating that story to everyone you've saved hasn't got you hacking up hairballs.
15705 : But enough tail wagging. I have some prey I need to take care of, so could you rrredeliver that gift to % and report back to me when you're done?
15706 : What timing! I've just rrreturned from my own mission. Whew, good thing % liked it! That little trinket was as high priced as the hair on a cat's back! Anyway, thanks for your help. If your fur ever gets rubbed the wrong way, give me a sign and I'll come rrroaring to the rescue!
15707 : A present...from %? Oh, glorious day! This is for all those times I never got a present and kept telling myself next year will be the one.
15708 : I'm at a loss for what to say! I'm just overwhelmed with a waterfall of emotion! Thank you so much!
15709 : And please thank % the next time you see that good samaritan. The person who said, 'Tis better to give than receive probably never had a gift drought as long as mine. I feel fantastic!
15710 : Oh, is that...a present? From %, you say?
15711 : Ugh, it figures. Did it come with a card that says something pathetic like I've died a thousand deaths drowning in the depths of your eyes? That scoundrel has been stalking me ever since we happened to meet one day on a boat to Buburimu Peninsula.
15712 : I'm actually quite fed up with these ridiculous baubles, but I'm not one for losing face. If you should see % again, please give my regards and say I found the gift rather...quaint.
15713 : What's this? A present addressed to me from %?
15714 : How unexpectedly charming and thoughtful. This has certainly brightened what was about to be a gloomy Starlight Celebration.
15715 : Would you be so kind as to tell % that I truly appreciate the gift? I am also thoroughly impressed with your selfless nature, adventurer.
15716 : Could it be...? Indeed, it is benevolence manifest, emanating from the humble home of one %?
15717 : What a decidedly pleasant surprise. I am simply beside myself with an unbridled, childish glee that has not washed over me in ever so long. I swear that I am on the brink of giggling like I used to when I was still knee-high to a Taru.
15718 : The finite words of us mere mortals may not be sufficient to convey the depths of my gratitude, but I earnestly hope % would appreciate a succinct Thank you.
15719 : A present from...%? This isn't one of those tricky-wicky flimflams, is it?
15720 : Of course I'll take it! I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's from my mortaru enemy! Maybe % has turned over a new leaf since we last met...
15721 : Well then, I suppose some thanks are in order. But if I find out that this was just some elaborataru scheme to make me lower my guard, I'm going to boppy-wop you both in the noggin!
15722 : Oooh, a gift from %? What jolly-wolly tidings you've brought, adventurer.
15723 : I wonder what's inside... Could it be a scrum-diddly-umptious cake? But I've already gotten so roly-poly during the holiday season! Maybe I should just send it back!
15724 : No, thataru wouldn't be right. Besides, it might not be edible. Anyway, please be sure to thank % for pudding the icing on such a delectable Starcake Chocolation. Ugh, I'm just terrible!
15725 : Why would % be sending me a gift? It's not like there's anything special going on.
15726 : The Starlight Celebration, you say? So that explains the light shows and festive atmosphere around here lately. My head just hasn't been the same since I fell off that chocobo last month.
15727 : I best start looking for something to give in return. In the meantime, please tell % how happy I am to have received this. And maybe next year I'll remember before it's too late. <Sigh>...One can only hope.
15728 : A present for me?  I'm a lone lioness, and I don't need to share my kills with anyone!
15729 : What? % wanted me to have this? Well, I guess I could take it...
15730 : Don't get the wrrrong idea! It's not like I enjoy the gift or anything! Just run back to % and drop dead! This conversation never happened!
15731 : You have received %!
15732 : Your % has been taken!
15733 : You handed over %.
15734 : Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.
15735 : Those who possess % may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused. Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.
15736 : Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
15737 : I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
15738 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Have stratum abyssite examined. Request teleportation. Analyze atmacite. Ask about atmacite. Ask about atmacite enrichment.
15739 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.
15740 : Infuse which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#) Previous page. Next page.
15741 : Infusing the % (lv.#) requires # cruor.
15742 : Infuse % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
15743 : You do not have enough cruor.
15744 : [Infuse/Purge] which atmacite? None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#)
15745 : Purge % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
15746 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with % (lv.#)!
15747 : The atmacite could not be infused...
15748 : % has been purged of the % (lv.#).
15749 : % purges the % (lv.#), infusing % (lv.#) in its place. (Cruor expended: #)
15750 : You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.
15751 : Enrich which atmacite? (Cruor: #) None for now. % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # % (lv.#): # Previous page. Next page.
15752 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
15753 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
15754 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
15755 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
15756 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
15757 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
15758 : The atmacite could not be purged...
15759 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
15760 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
15761 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
15762 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
15763 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
15764 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
15765 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
15766 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
15767 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
15768 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
15769 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
15770 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
15771 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
15772 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
15773 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
15774 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
15775 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
15776 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
15777 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
15778 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
15779 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
15780 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
15781 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
15782 : Your % has evolved into %!
15783 : Supply me with the # cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.

16518 : I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the [Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana]. My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.
16519 : I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.
16520 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Ask a bunch of questions. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
16521 : While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess % may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
16522 : The % is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.
16523 : Enlisted in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s armed forces, you say? Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.
16524 : I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
16525 : While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel. Come back again once you have proven your worth.
16526 : You must be at least level # to participate in Voidwatch.
16527 : Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!
16528 : I see you've yet to be issued %. Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.
16529 : Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.
16530 : You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or jurisdiction.
16531 : Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.
16532 : While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with %.
16533 : Operations are presently underway at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
16534 : Operations are presently underway at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
16535 : Operations are presently underway at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
16536 : It would seem some other requirement exists besides the usual % and %.
16537 : Rest assured, you will be apprised of this information as soon as we acquire it.
16538 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].
16539 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg].
16540 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo].
16541 : When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension. The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.
16542 : Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!
16543 : Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.
16544 : The % you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.
16545 : You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
16546 : Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts. This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.
16547 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
16548 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
16549 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
16550 : Operations are currently underway [in the greater Jeuno region/in the three nations]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
16551 : Ah, I daresay your % has undergone change!
16552 : How many would you like? None. Just one. Fill me up!
16553 : Here is your additional % allocation. Make each and every one count, you hear?
16554 : It appears you already possess the maximum allocation of # stones. I'm not authorized to provision you with more.
16555 : I'm afraid we're out of stock. The next shipment is expected to arrive in # [minute/minutes] (Earth time).
16556 : Obtained key item: # %!
16557 : Obtained key item: # %!
16558 : Your outstanding allocation of %? My records tell me you have # to your name.
16559 : Exchange for what? (Cruor: #) Nothing right now. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #.
16560 : # cruor is required for %.
16561 : # cruor is required for the %.
16562 : Proceed? (Required Cruor: #) Yes. No.
16563 : It seems you do not have enough cruor.
16564 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for %!
16565 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for the %!
16566 : Hm? It seems you already possess %. In that case, you won't be needing another.
16567 : This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.
16568 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.
16569 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.
16570 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.
16571 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.
16572 : A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.
16573 : A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.
16574 : A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
16575 : What will you ask about? Nothing. The Voidwalker threat. How I can do my part. The Voidwatch. Voidwatchers. Ascent items. Riftworn pyxides. %. Stratum abyssite. Planar rifts. Cruor. Abyssite. Voidstone consumption.
16576 : Voidwalker is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.
16577 : Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.
16578 : While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.
16579 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.
16580 : As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.
16581 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.
16582 : To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.
16583 : Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.
16584 : Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.
16585 : Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought. Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.
16586 : These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team. They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.
16587 : Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.
16588 : The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to # stones per person at any given time.
16589 : That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.
16590 : The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call Voidwalkers.
16591 : Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.
16592 : Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.
16593 : Possession of % is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
16594 : It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.
16595 : You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.
16596 : Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
16597 : In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.
16598 : The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.
16599 : When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.
16600 : Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.
16601 : However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.
16602 : Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.
16603 : Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.
16604 : But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the existential spectrum.
16605 : You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned. In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.
16606 : The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.
16607 : To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.
16608 : Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
16609 : Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.
16610 : One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items, while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.
16611 : Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.
16612 : All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.
16613 : Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.
16614 : For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.
16615 : In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.
16616 : Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.
16617 : If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.
16618 : Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company. It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.
16619 : Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.
16620 : Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.
16621 : Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.
16622 : % and % are representative of such items. They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.
16623 : (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)
16624 : They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.
16625 : Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.
16626 : Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.
16627 : Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.
16628 : Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding. But I digress...
16629 : Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.
16630 : As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch. Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.
16631 : It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.
16632 : Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong. Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.
16633 : Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.
16634 : The % is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.
16635 : Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.
16636 : The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.
16637 : I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.
16638 : I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.
16639 : Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?
16640 : Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.
16641 : Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them. Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!
16642 : And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.
16643 : I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really. Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.
16644 : As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray. Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...
16645 : Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.
16646 : Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing. There exists another: stratum abyssite.
16647 : Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite. Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.
16648 : Are you familiar with voiddust? Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.
16649 : As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch. Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.
16650 : The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust. Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me? Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.
16651 : At any rate, should you manage to obtain any voiddust in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me. Simple enough, wouldn't you say?
16652 : Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
16653 : Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.
16654 : If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.
16655 : Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land. The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
16656 : By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension.
16657 : Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.
16658 : Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.
16659 : Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.
16660 : Keep this fact in mind at all times.
16661 : It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.
16662 : If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...
16663 : Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
16664 : While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.
16665 : As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants. There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.
16666 : Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.
16667 : Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite. If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.
16668 : As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.
16669 : Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.
16670 : Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called periapt--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
16671 : Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.
16672 : Select where voidstones will be consumed from.
16673 : Set to which? Key items. Stock.
16674 : Voidstones will now be taken from [your key items/the stock].
16675 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here is your voidstone! Take it and use it well.
16676 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here are your voidstones! Take them and use them well.
16677 : It seems you already possess as many voidstones as you can carry. You'll want to hold on to that voiddust until you've depleted your supply.
16678 : How many do you need? (Cruor: #) None, thank you. One (# cruor). Three (# cruor). Six (# cruor). Nine (# cruor). Twelve (# cruor).
16679 : % obtains one % in exchange for # cruor.
16680 : % obtains # % in exchange for # cruor.

16689 : At attention, soldier! I've received an urgent alarum calling our best men to arms, and guess whose name is listed front and center? You're to report to Jeuno for further orders immediately.
16690 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me. Pick up those legs and get a move on!
16691 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me.
16692 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate in Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through.
16693 : Time is short, so pick up those legs and get a move on, soldier!
16694 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate just over there and one of our men will see you through.
16695 : Excellent work, %. You serve the Voidwatch well. Your presence has been requested in the Grand Duchy once more. Make your way there with all speed.
16696 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace.
16697 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
16698 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate at Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.

16700 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate over there and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
16701 : Where's your %, soldier? I'll need to see one before I can authorize your participation in the [Jeuno/Qufim] Voidwatch jurisdiction.
16702 : % are issued only to those brave men and women who have distinguished themselves in regional Voidwatch efforts.
16703 : Prove yourself capable in the three nations, and you can rest assured that your abilities won't go overlooked. Keep fighting the good fight, soldier!
16704 : Reporting for combat, are you? Yes, this % of yours appears to be in order. Welcome aboard!
16705 : I suspect you've already been briefed about the use of %, but protocol dictates that I ask if you are in need of a review. What will it be, soldier?
16706 : What will it be, soldier? Ready for battle, sir! I need a briefing, sir!
16707 : Now that's what I like to hear, soldier!

16725 : Hold it right there, soldier! A summons just came in from the Grand Duchy, and it's got your name on it. The envoy said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you get moving.
16726 : We've been looking for you, soldier. I've got a summons from the Grand Duchy here, and just look at the name on it: %. Our messenger said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you ready yourself and depart immediately.
16727 : You may also undertake this operation at Beaucedine Glacier.
16728 : How many? (Cruor: #)
16729 : You may purchase up to # at a time.
16730 : Hail, soldier. I am a purveyor tasked with furnishing the brave men and women of the Voidwatch with essential supplies. My wares can be yours, provided you've got [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes] to trade. After all, we can't afford to let our limited resources go to waste in the hands of some unproven rookie.

16734 : It seems you're short on [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing credits/Allied Notes], soldier. Come back when you've got a bit more seasoning under your belt.
16735 : Proceed? (Required [Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Yes. No.
16736 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].

16752 : Will you take something? Nothing right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Previous Page. Next Page.
16753 : You pull out % for closer inspection.
16754 : Obtain this item? Yes. On second thought...
16755 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
16756 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
16757 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
16758 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
16759 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
16760 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
16761 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
16762 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
16763 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
16764 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
16765 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
16766 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
16767 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
16768 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
16769 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
16770 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
16771 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
16772 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
16773 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
16774 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
16775 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
16776 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
16777 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
16778 : Deal, kupo? (Current gil: #). Check storable items. Deal. No deal.
16779 : The % will allow you to store the following items:

16784 : Warning! If you lose your % while storing a corresponding item, you will be forever unable to retrieve that item!
16785 : Is that % I see, kupo?
16786 : What will you do? Retrieve an item. Confirm storable items. Nothing.
16787 : Retrieve an item? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
16788 : Retrieve %? Retrieve it. Leave it.
16789 : You retrieve % from the porter moogle's care.
16790 : Kupo? I'm already taking care of that item for you.
16791 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
16792 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
16793 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
16794 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
16795 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
16796 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.
16797 : Why, it looks as if you have % located in your [inventory/Mog Safe/Mog Safe 2/Mog House storage/Mog Locker/Mog Satchel/Mog Sack/Mog Case/Mog Wardrobe/Mog Wardrobe 2/Mog Wardrobe 3/Mog Wardrobe 4/Mog Wardrobe 5/Mog Wardrobe 6/Mog Wardrobe 7/Mog Wardrobe 8/Recycle Bin]!

16809 : You now have 5,000,000 cruor!
16810 : Hey, you--able adventurer! Cast your gaze on the countenance of this misbegotten mutant.
16811 : Glance at the good-natured glimmer in his eyes!
16812 : Take in his tiny teeth scintillating in the sunlight, kupo!
16813 : You mean...you're familiar with its furry form?
16814 : Oh hush, hustler. Listen to the lowdown before you loosen your lips.
16815 : Remember the gristly green gobs who came before? Now its mauve and maroon mates have come to wreak wrongdoings upon our realm!
16816 : At least, I suppose so. They haven't lifted a limb of late, so maybe there should be nothing nagging at my noggin after all...
16817 : Let me tell you a troubled tale. Not long ago, some grisly green gobs came to Vana'diel, and we amassed a fabulous fortune crafting countless curios in their likeness.
16818 : But there was an--inconsequential?--issue with them consuming crystals like crunchy candies.
16819 : Thanks to hardy heroes and moogle magic, we turned them into cerulean stone shards and sent them scurrying home, kupo.
16820 : But we gave the victors great gifts resembling those rowdy ruffians, so our profits plummeted and we had to cancel our tropical travel plans...
16821 : But the past is in the past. We must make the most of the moment!
16822 : And so! With the multicolored monsters now manifesting themselves, we found our next best chance!
16823 : They haven't lifted a limb of late, so maybe there's nothing to knock my noggin over...
16824 : Thus, we have an ostensibly outstanding opportunity to manufacture new knickknacks, kupo!
16825 : Part of the proceeds will be diverted to do up dilapidated Mog Houses, with the rest funding our jovial jaunts!
16826 : Kupopopo! How magnificently marvelous!
16827 : You can't discern the difference between the dimensional delegates?
16828 : Give them a good glance!
16829 : I guess their terrible teeth and enchanting eyes do look alike...
16830 : But the metal in their mitts and trinkets on their waists! Those are different, kupo!
16831 : Wonderful! We can cut down on costs and rake in the revenue! Vivacious vacations for all!
16832 : A-ah! Forget my frivolous fettering.
16833 : But if we captured the cerulean creatures before, then how did they surreptitiously scuttle back?
16834 : Undeniably unimportant. What matters most is the moment!
16835 : Oh ho? A covert communique from my cohort in charge of the stone shard storage.
16836 : Yes? Mm hmm... Mm hmm...
16837 : Altana kupo it all!
16838 : The ones we previously petrified have escaped, and they're traipsing outside town!
16839 : Then again, the clock was ticking on the enchantment expiring.
16840 : ...And now a nuanced notification from outside town? Oh, dear.
16841 : Th-then it's true, kupo!
16842 : Great gasping Goblins! Those furry freaks are capturing crystals again!
16843 : And their bespeckled brethren are helping, kupo!
16844 : If they succeed in pilfering our precious prizes, Vana'diel will descend into a desolate decay!
16845 : And worse, snafu will surely stain the M.H.M.U.'s resplendent reputation!
16846 : Most excellent explorer, please travel outside town and round up these recidivist reprobates!
16847 : A mixture of moogle magic will enable you to ensconce the evildoers by subjugating them into stone shards.
16848 : Of course, I'll reward your righteousness with the requisite remuneration, kupo.
16849 : But since we have such a short supply of stuff, I have to let Lady Luck look upon you with...a lottery!
16850 : The most prestigious prizes are awarded in the order of mauve, vermilion, and chartruese stone shards.
16851 : The goods we've gathered can be chosen from a long list that lengthens depending on your success.
16852 : Simply stated, if you procure first prize, you can select spoils from lower levels should you deign to do so. And so on.
16853 : This is a dire dilemma, so I shall send you off to the outskirts immediately. Are you ready, kupo?
16854 : Be teleported outside of town? You bet! I don't think so.
16855 : Ready and raring to go! The M.H.M.U.--and all Vana'diel--appreciates your assistance!
16856 : O-oh dear, kupo... But we really require reinforcements! Please reconsider, kupo!
16857 : You have phenomenally procured a prodigious amount of # chartruese stone shard[/s], # vermilion stone shard[/s], and # mauve stone shard[/s]. What would you like, kupo?
16858 : What will you do? Spin the wheel! (# chartruese shard[/s]) Spin the wheel! (# vermilion shard[/s]) Spin the wheel! (# mauve shard[/s]) Check the item list. Warp outside town. Nothing.
16859 : You have not harvested a sufficient supply of [mauve stone shards/vermilion stone shards/chartruese stone shards], kupo! Clobber more critters and come back later!
16860 : Altana above, kupo!
16861 : Congratulations!
16862 : You're more likely to get on a hot streak thanks to the intricacies of that item!
16863 : You are on a hot streak!
16864 : Your hot streak has burned out.
16865 : Roll them bones, kupo!
16866 : And the outstanding outcome is...
16867 : [.../First prize! Absolutely amazing!/Second prize! Emphatically excellent!/Third prize! Positively peachy!]
16868 : ...the booby prize, kupo...

16871 : Would you like this item, kupo?

16874 : View which category? First prize. Second prize. Third prize. Booby prize. None for now.
16875 : It goes something like this, kupo.
16876 : That little black bugger has been staring into your soul for some time now, kupo.
16877 : Don't be charmed by its conniving countenance! It'll con a crystal from you!
16878 : Here where?
16879 : Give shiny rock! Shiiiny. Shiiiiiiny!

16891 : new Records of Eminence objective, %, is now available!
16892 : You wish to exchange your sparks?
16893 : Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
16894 : Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
16895 : Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
16896 : Thanks to your donation, I now have # % in safekeeping.
16897 : Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
16898 : Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
16899 : Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
16900 : Why? What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
16901 : Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of # % from you.
16902 : You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
16903 : Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
16904 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
16905 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
16906 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
16907 : Grrreat! Now I have # % from you. Thanks!
16908 : Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
16909 : I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
16910 : Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
16911 : I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
16912 : Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of # % for you.
16913 : Records of Eminence is a system brought to you by the caring folks at the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Set your own objectives whenever you desire, and fulfill them to receive compensation.
16914 : To set these tasks, select 'Objective List' from the Quests menu, then choose ones that suit your fancy.
16915 : You will be rewarded with gil and sparks of eminence, which serve the same function as points, notes, credits, and other such methods of quantifying one's greatness. As an extra incentive, adventurers will earn three times the amount of sparks for completing an objective the first time.
16916 : Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
16917 : As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
16918 : Lastly, any and all acts of vandalism directed against your % are strictly prohibited.

17014 : Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
17015 : Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.
17016 : Unity is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.
17017 : Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.
17018 : Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as %.
17019 : Chat settings may be changed by selecting Status from the main menu, and choosing Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
17020 : You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.
17021 : Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.
17022 : The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.
17023 : Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).
17024 : Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.
17025 : Wanted objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.
17026 : These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as Unity accolades to undertake.
17027 : Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.
17028 : Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.
17029 : The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.
17030 : A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.
17031 : Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.
17032 : Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.
17033 : When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.
17034 : Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.
17035 : No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.
17036 : You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.
17037 : An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.
17038 : One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.
17039 : A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.
17040 : You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.
17041 : Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.
17042 : Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.
17043 : Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.
17044 : The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.
17045 : It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.
17046 : The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.
17047 : Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.
17048 : These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.
17049 : Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.
17050 : Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of # accolades per week (Earth time).
17051 : You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.
17052 : This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.
17053 : This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.
17054 : However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.
17055 : Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.
17056 : The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.
17057 : Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.
17058 : Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.
17059 : On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.
17060 : Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by #. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.
17061 : The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.
17062 : Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.
17063 : Those with evaluations of # or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.
17064 : Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.
17065 : A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.
17066 : Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.
17067 : A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.
17068 : It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.
17069 : Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.
17070 : ou are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.
17071 : he A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.
17072 : ou call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.
17073 : ou have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.
17074 : hould you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?
17075 : Teleport anyway? Yes, please. No, thank you.
17077 : The crystal resonates deep within your soul!
17078 : Vana'diel...in the year 898?
17079 : I must make haste for Reisenjima and find the master before...
17080 : Master, look at the orb.
17081 : You have set us on the proper course and passed through the first of many gates to come.
17082 : This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.
17083 : Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.
17084 : Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.
17085 : In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.
17086 : Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.
17087 : Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.
17088 : Master, behold your orb.
17089 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.
17090 : But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...
17091 : And I am unable to remain here in 884.
17092 : My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.
17093 : Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...
17094 : But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.
17095 : May your steps remain swift and true.
17096 : Head for...the palace...
17097 : Master, behold your orb.
17098 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.
17099 : But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.
17100 : I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.
17101 : If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!
17102 : Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!
17103 : Master...forgive me.
17104 : Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.
17105 : I'm so hungry...
17106 : Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?
17107 : I'm here...[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...
17108 : Luzaf...I wish you were here...
17109 : Please...help me...
17110 : Razfahd must be stopped...
17111 : The time of the Harvest Festival is upon us once more, and with it comes a most wondrous event: a costume contest known as the Pink Masquerade!
17112 : Sick of donning those tattered old robes and half-rusted suits of armor? Then why not take this opportunity to dress up in something more festive--and perhaps even earn a prize for your efforts?
17113 : At the very least, the masquerade promises to be a refreshing change from your everyday adventures. What say you?
17114 : Participate in the Pink Masquerade? Sounds like fun! I think I'll pass.
17115 : A shame upon shames, to be sure. But there's still time to change your mind--the masquerade is available throughout the duration of the Harvest Festival!
17116 : Splendid! Let me explain the rules of our little competition.
17117 : All entrants are tasked with putting together the most lavish outfits they can find and strutting their stuff for the judge--namely, me. Points are awarded for the following types of equipment: main weapon, sub weapon, head, body, hands, legs, and feet.
17118 : We're an equal opportunity contest, so don't think you'll be impressing anyone here with your Gjallarhorns or Idrises! Only rewards gleaned from special events are counted.
17119 : Feel free to brandish them if you want, but don't expect me to care in the slightest.
17120 : As this is an event to celebrate the Harvest Festival, entrance fees will not be charged in the form of gil, but rather sweets.
17121 : Those whose outfits receive at least # points will be awarded with a commemorative piece of attire directly from the steering committee.
17122 : But why be content with being mediocre when you can reach for the stars? The top three contestants will have their entries displayed on these mannequins for all to see!
17123 : That's the long and short of it. Speak with me again if you have any further questions or would like to know what types of sweets we accept.
17124 : Until then, prepare your most outlandish costume and come back when you're ready to be judged!
17125 : Take this special garb as your just rewarded for coming up with such a delightful outfit!
17126 : Oh, heavens! Don't tell me you lost your %!
17127 : A distressing tale, indeed. I will furnish you with another one should you provide me with another piece of sweets.
17128 : As promised, here is another reward in exchange for your sweets. Make sure to keep this one safe and in pristine condition!
17129 : The pink masquerade is proving to be the event of the season, and I am both humbled and honored to serve as your guide.
17130 : Do you have any questions? Who are the winning entrants? Tell me about the costume contest. What kind of sweets do you want? Tell me how entrants are judged. I'd like %. None for now.
17131 : The costumes of the three entrants with the highest scores are displayed here for you to see. First place is in the center, second place is on the left, and third place is on the right. It is possible that multiple entrants have received the same score.
17132 : [/First/Second/Third] place: % - # pts.
17133 : No participants have received enough points to have their outfits displayed.
17134 : I will accept any of the following types of sweets as payment for participation in the masquerade.
17135 : Sweets list: (# types. Page # of #) Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm done. Next page.
17136 : The judgment criteria is a bit nuanced, but I'll offer you the best explanation I can.
17137 : As the sole arbiter of fashion, the chief and chief alone issues garment-related edicts without any concern for race or gender.
17138 : Each accent you add to your costume affects the overall look, and he will determine a numerical value based upon the stuff you strut.
17139 : Yet I must warn you that he has trained hard under Brygid's watchful eye, and recognizes that the trends of the season are as fickle as the westerly winds.
17140 : In other words, just because you have received a particular score for wearing a given outfit, you are not guaranteed the same reception if you come back later donning the same garb.
17141 : And of course, the sweets you give me plays an integral... Ahem! Forget I said anything!
17142 : Another player's outfit is currently being critiqued. Please come back later.
17143 : Well, well, would you look at that stunning little number. Chief! You have a visitor!
17144 : Your score for this outfit is... #!
17145 : [Did your mother dress you in that?/Next time, put your socks on under your shoes!/I've seen worse...but not by much./Maybe if you had offered up some better sweets.../<Yawn> Been there, done that./The chief is wholly unimpressed./What an affront to common sensibility./At least you remembered to brush your teeth./The color scheme was a bit off...] Take your mistakes and learn from them for your next entry!
17146 : Congratulations! You have met the bar for success!
17147 : Here is your splendid gift, as promised!
17148 : I have given you all I have to give, but why not give it another go to see if you can place in the top three?
17149 : Why, this is one of the most splendid outfits we've seen! I am more than pleased to award you [/first/second/third] place!
17150 : Let me put that wonderful costume of yours up for display on one of our mannequins.
17151 : That's all I have for now. See if you can beat your own personal record next time!
17152 : As promised, here is your just reward for doing such a good job in this year's Pink Masquerade.
17153 : Though I've got nothing more to give you, I encourage you to participate again to see if you can beat your score!
17154 : (Shhh...mannequins aren't supposed to talk.)
17155 : (The pain of having to stand here perfectly still is indescribable...)
17156 : (At least I'll be able to line my stomach with sugary goodness once this is over.)
17157 : You must first turn the style lock function off before trading that item.
17158 : #%(Max:#)
17159 : #Woo-hoo factor.
17160 : (#/#/#(Max:#))
17161 : #Results.
17162 : Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...
17163 : I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.
17164 : I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.
17165 : Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.
17166 : The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.
17167 : Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?
17168 : Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?
17169 : Old gods? New?
17170 : No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.
17171 : We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.
17172 : And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.
17173 : There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.
17174 : Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.
17175 : And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.
17176 : Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.
17177 : But I am not a human such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.
17178 : For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.
17179 : Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.
17180 : Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.
17181 : It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.
17182 : I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.
17183 : All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...
17184 : An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.
17185 : I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.
17186 : Can you truly say that you [did/would have done] any different?
17187 : I channeled my love for my homeland into power.
17188 : When I fell before you...
17189 : ...did it mean everything was for naught?
17190 : I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.
17191 : And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.
17192 : This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.
17193 : Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.
17194 : Open your eyes and witness the truth!
17195 : Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!
17196 : %...
17197 : What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?
17198 : Is this a dream? What else could it be? No. It's something more...
17199 : Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.
17200 : A keen eye, as always.
17201 : The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.
17202 : As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.
17203 : I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.
17204 : And those...
17205 : ...Who you are destined to stop.
17206 : I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.
17207 : Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.
17208 : And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.
17209 : You don't really expect to save the world, do you?
17210 : At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.
17211 : Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.
17212 : So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.
17213 : One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.
17214 : Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.
17215 : False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers... The truth is the pain I feel inside.
17216 : Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.
17217 : Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.
17218 : Perhaps not even your precious-wecious hope.
17219 : Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.
17220 : No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...
17221 : ...no matter how much you want to give up...
17222 : You must not. You cannot.
17223 : Hope is something seized, not given.
17224 : Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...
17225 : There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.
17226 : You are the culmination of all your experiences.
17227 : Even those who are gone still depend on you.
17228 : %, this rhapsody is yours to sing.
17232 : Master--the orb.
17233 : You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.
17234 : Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.
17235 : He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.
17236 : I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?
17237 : What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.
17238 : We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.
17239 : Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.
17240 : And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...
17241 : The future should have changed...
17242 : ...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.
17243 : Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.
17244 : And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.
17245 : Able adventurer, warmest welcome from the Magian Mooglehood.
17246 : To think you can perceive me in my true form, kupo! The trials of time take a toll on us all.
17247 : I command and control crystal-related incantations. Their ephemeral essence helps hold Vana'diel together.
17248 : Surely you have studied synthesis? Then you are doubtlessly versed in their myriad uses, kupo.
17249 : Promise you will not speak a syllable to others of my existence here.
17250 : Will you stay mum? Mum's the word. I don't think so.
17251 : ...
17252 : I scarce have the stamina to stop you, but I doubt others would believe this tale anyway.
17253 : Still, I shan't assist you if you don't promise.
17254 : Then the deed is done! In exchange, I shall proudly proffer my services in making your crystals ephemeral, too, kupo.
17255 : Ahhh, mayhap I have moved too quickly. Allow me to apprise you of the particulars--of this crystal storage, if you will.
17256 : It's strikingly simple. Trade me your crystals and I shall safely store them for you. You need only glance at your currencies list to see the amount I'm holding for you.
17257 : But I can store more than crystals alone. % and the like are also acceptable.
17258 : My mysterious moogle magic has limits, kupo, so I can only hold up to 5000 of a particular element.
17259 : You never know what secrets are in store unless you try!
17260 : You can wistfully withdraw them at any time by speaking to me.
17261 : Any number over 12 will be returned as clusters, kupo.
17262 : The  gives a sly smile.
17263 : This service is available to you free from the fetters of funding. As long as you keep this hush-hush, I'll always assist you with no recompense required.
17264 : If you can find me here, then you'll surely see me in other locations too, kupo. Moogle magic, you know.
17265 : Of course, I do not actually exist in Vana'diel. Only a part of me projects into your world.
17266 : It's rather similar to summoning magic, kupo.
17267 : I promise not to bore you with the particulars. Just come chat if you need me, kupo.
17268 : You are now able to store crystals!
17269 : Come for crystal-related concerns, hmm?
17270 : What would you like? Crystals returned to me. A bit of an explanation. Nothing for now.
17271 : Which element? Never mind. Fire  # Ice . # Wind . # Earth . # Lightning . # Water . # Light . # Darkness . #
17272 : How many would you like? None, actually. A specific number. As many you can fit.
17273 : How many? (# stored)
17274 : # [/fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/darkness] crystal[/s], correct? Then that will mean a total of...
17275 : # %.
17276 : # % and # %.
17277 : Are you sure?
17278 : Is this what you desire? Yes. No.
17279 : As many as you can fit!? I-if you say so...
17280 : Okay... Moogle Magic, ahoy!
17281 : There are limits to what my mysterious moogle magic can make up.
17282 : Inquire about what? Your purpose. Storing crystals. Retrieving crystals. Who are you? Nothing in particular.
17283 : I'm in charge of crystal chants. Crystals, of course, are the very lifeblood of Vana'diel, kupo.
17284 : Surely your sacks are spilling over with them! I can perhaps assist you with your problem.
17285 : You want me to hold onto these, kupo?
17286 : # %.
17287 : # % and # %.
17288 : Calculated in crystals, that comes to a total of # %.
17289 : Then let the magic begin!
17290 : That's all there is to it, kupo! Let me know if you need me again.
17291 : Unfortunately, it's all I can do to hold on to what you've already given me, kupo!
17292 : You have stored # % for a total of #.
17293 : You have stored # % and # ) for a total of #.
17294 : You want me to hold onto these, kupo? Then let the magic begin!
17295 : You have stored # % for a total of #.
17296 : You have stored # % and # ) for a total of #.
17297 : Here we sell items from the various guildmasters and also exchange crafter points for your convenience.
17298 : Sorry, we don't allow amateur craftsmen to take advantage of our services.
17299 : What would you like to do? Purchase a crafting kit. Exchange crafter points. . Special materials. Check the deliverable items. Ask about the delivery process. Never mind.

17302 : You want to purchase %? It will cost # gil for # of them.
17303 : Are you sure about this? Yes, I'm sure. On second thought...
17304 : I'm sorry, we don't currently seem to have the item available in that quantity.
17305 : Which item? (# crafter points) % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). I changed my mind.
17306 : Do you want to purchase the % for # crafter points?
17307 : Do you want to make the trade? Yes. No.
17308 : You don't have enough crafter points.
17309 : These are the items that we are taking deliveries of. Simply select an item whenever you want to check the recipe.
17310 : Deliverable Items %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm finished here.
17311 : This is where you can deliver the crafting sets that the guildmasters have created.
17312 : By delivering items, you can earn crafter points that can be exchanged for special ingredients.
17313 : Crafting sets can be made by using special crystals known as analysis crystals, crystals which that enable you to set the quality level.
17314 : The higher the quality level of the crafting set created, the more crafter points you'll earn, so try to make the highest quality sets you can manage.
17315 : Analysis crystals can be obtained from the person in charge of accepting deliveries in exchange for guild points.
17316 : Analysis crystals cannot be used to create items other than the ones in the crafting sets.
17317 : Please note that you can't use % in place of %.
17318 : The ingredients required to make a crafting set can be checked by referring to the deliverable items list.
17319 : At the present time, you can receive up to a maximum of # guild point[/s].
17320 : Any points beyond that from making deliveries will be lost, so keep that in mind.
17321 : Crafting sets delivered here will be sold as crafting kits until the next day at 10:00 a.m. (Vana'diel time).
17322 : It helps the junior members of the guild, so keep on making those deliveries.
17323 : Thanks for the delivery. Everything looks to be in order.
17324 : You receive # crafter point[/s], and now have a total of # crafter point[/s]!
17325 : We now have available % for the low cost of # gil per.
17326 : I am willing to part with up to #.
17327 : My apologies, but our stock is limited and I cannot sell you any more at this time.
17328 : What do you want to do? Obtain a kit. Check the scheduled quantity. Ship the item. Nothing.

17330 : What is the quality? (1-1000)
17331 : %: #
17332 : Oh, hello. Hm? Whataru is that shield you're holding?
17333 : Ahh, I see... You must've spoken with her.
17334 : Yes, I've heard the stories... That it's possible-wossible to equip a shield that boosts your crafting skill.
17335 : If anybody has the ability to create such a thing, it's you. I'm sure she chose you for a reason-weason.
17336 : I don't understand how a shield helps one's cooking, but if she's right, that'd be quite the talentaru to have.
17337 : First, let's go over the recipe. Try not to forgetaru it!
17338 : So, the first ingredientaru you'll need is %...
17339 : Its purpose is to boostaru the Craftsmanship of the % to its maximum value.
17340 : I've actually got a memo-wemo on Craftsmanship here to read to you.
17341 : You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the % equipped.
17342 : Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you have trouble.
17343 : In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.
17344 : You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...
17345 : That's all it says.
17346 : Come show me once you've raised the Craftsmanship to the necessary level-wevel. I'll make you the % you need.
17347 : After that, you'll need % and %. You can get them from Isanie.
17348 : You have experience making deliveries, correctaru? This is basically the same thing.
17349 : If you need to know more, justaru go talk to Isanie.
17350 : That's it for the ingredients! Come show me the shield when you're done. It has really piqued my interestaru. Do you think we can use it as a frying pan?
17351 : Hm? You say you forgotaru the recipe? I know we do things differently, but it's important to remember these kinds of things.
17352 : You're my constantaru partner on the path of fine cuisine. If anybody can make this shield, it's you!
17353 : Oh, you did it! Now, I can make the % on the listaru.
17354 : So this is the %. It turned out perfectaru.
17355 : I'm not sure I know why, but seeing this crystal made by pouring my soul into the shield, I start feeling hungry-wungry.
17356 : Hmm... In creating the %, it appears to have the effectaru of reducing the Craftsmanship of the %.
17357 : That's no problem-woblem if you want to upgrade the %, but if you need to make another %, you'll have to raise the Craftsmanship again.
17358 : Of course, I'm sure I can countaru on you to never lose this thing.
17359 : What? Did you really lose the %? After that little chataru that we had too?
17360 : Never mind. I'll simply-wimply make you another %. Let me see your shield.
17361 : You're better than this. People of your talentaru should take better care of their ingredients.
17362 : It looks like the upgrade is complete. Hurry up now! Let me see it!
17363 : Hmm... I can tell that it looks different-wifferent. And it smells good too! Although, it doesn't seem like it's complete.
17364 : I heard her say that you'll need to craft with it multiple times in order to get it just rightaru.
17365 : Oh, that reminds me. I was asked to give some kind of proof that the shield was complete. One momentaru please.
17366 : That should do it.
17367 : Take this to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno in order to complete the requestaru.
17368 : Oh, and I often have deliveries for Isanie. I could really use your expertaru skills in bringing along the newer guild members.
17369 : Hello there. I suppose you're here to upgrade your shield, yes? I've already heard all aboutaru it.
17370 : The first thing is to teach you the recipe. Try not to forgetaru it, okay?
17371 : This is much differentaru than the recipes I'm used to.
17372 : At any rate, I need to tell you how to obtain the listaru of ingredients. The first one is the %.
17373 : Last time, you used the aspis to increase the Craftsmanship. Basically, you need to do the same thing again to craftaru items while the % is equipped.
17374 : It seems that it will take longer to boostaru the Craftsmanship this time around. As such, you'll need to have patience.
17375 : Bring me the shield once it reaches 100% and I'll use my expertaru skills to create the % for you.
17376 : The next ingredientaru you'll require is the %. I've given it and the % that you used last time to Isanie.
17377 : The lastaru ingredient you'll need is the %. I've teamed up with the A.M.A.N. to create some Records of Eminence objectives for you.
17378 : Check the Records of Eminence menu to find out the extentaru of the objectives. Once you've completed them all, you'll receive the %.
17379 : That's it for the ingredients! Think you can handle it? I'm confidentaru that you have what it takes to succeed.
17380 : Well, let's see what you've got there.
17381 : Yes! This'll do just fine! Here, let me get a startaru on that % for you.
17382 : Okay, it's all finished. Tell me, whataru do you think?
17383 : Hmm... It looks like creating the % has caused its Craftsmanship to revertaru downwards again.
17384 : Remember, if you lose the %, you'll need to boostaru the shield's Craftsmanship again. Do be careful with it.
17385 : Oh... I thoughtaru it would look like a frying pan, but it's more of a cutting board I suppose. Yes, of course I know it's a shield!
17386 : Although, I can feel that its power is well beyond that of the lastaru shield. Yes, this one is destined to become quite formidable!
17387 : Here, allow me to mark it for you before I forgetaru.
17388 : There we go. Now, justaru take it to Mewk Chorosap and your task will be complete.
17389 : Hmm... You must complete this final objective or your task will be an abjectaru failure. Go and give it another try.
17390 : Hm? It's that frying pan...oh, I mean shield, again! Now, let's get you that recipe-wecipe.
17391 : Oh, you already know the recipe. So I suppose you need to know how to obtain what's on the ingredients listaru.
17392 : The % and %... Okay, listen carefully-warefully.
17393 : You see, the Culinarians' Guild has received quite a few delivery orders for our delicious-welicious food. We could really use your help.
17394 : However, this is a little differentaru than our usual deliveries. Food is always best when cooked fresh, so you need to make it in front of the customer.
17395 : Of course, I would demand the same treatmentaru myself. So basically, anything made elsewhere will not be accepted.
17396 : Once you have delivered all of the food, I can give you the % and % you're looking-wooking for.
17397 : Okay, this is the [first/next/final] request.
17398 : Deliver a total-wotal of # % to Melloa at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant in %
17399 : Deliver a total-wotal of # % to Melloa at the Steaming Sheep Restaurant in %
17400 : Deliver a total-wotal of # % to Hinaree in %
17401 : Deliver a total-wotal of # % to Hinaree in %
17402 : Once you've made the delivery-wivery, come see me.
17403 : Let's see here... Your current requestaru is...
17404 : How is the requestaru going? Good I hope?
17405 : Everything okay? Everything's great! It could be better...
17406 : Yes, I'm relieved to hear it. Keep up the good work until the requestaru is complete.
17407 : Hm?! Surely you're joking-woking? Do you really want to give up on this request?
17408 : Will you see this through? I'll do my best. I've had enough.
17409 : Is that so... Well, if you're not feeling up to it, it's a disservice to our customers-wustomers. I'll ask another craftsman for help.
17410 : Take a momentaru to refresh yourself and come back for another request after you're feeling better.
17411 : So, are you feeling-weeling any better now? If so, let's get on to the next request.
17412 : Welcome back. It seems you took care of that requestaru for me. I'm sure the customer is quite pleased.
17413 : Excellentaru work! You've completed all of the requests. I bet it's the most satisfied customer ever!
17414 : Here you go. I presentaru you with the % and %.
17415 : Also, if you ever need more of them, you can make a trade using guild points.
17416 : Lately, I've been wondering what it'd be like to boil-woil or grill this thing... Would it taste any good?
17417 : Did it finally turn into a frying pan this time around? I think that'd be a simply perfect resultaru.
17418 : Oh, it's justaru a shield. Although, I can vouch for just how amazing both it and you are!
17419 : Our friend seems to think that the nextaru upgrade will unlock the shield's ultimate power. I can't wait to see it for myself.
17420 : Oh, wait just a momentaru. I have a new crafting technique that I think you'd do quite well with. I can't wait to see what you cook up with it!
17421 : I thoughtaru you'd be coming around here! The shield has almost reached its final form!
17422 : Allow me to teach-weach you how to obtain the necessary ingredients.
17423 : First, there's the % and the %.
17424 : You can get them from Isanie by trading crafter points for them. I have a feeling-weeling you already knew that, though.
17425 : Next is the %. It's the same procedure you've used before. Visitaru me after you raise your shield's Craftsmanship to 100%.
17426 : That's it for how to obtain the materials! I suppose you should get started by giving your Craftsmanship rating a boostaru!
17427 : Here's the % as per the instructions I received. I heard that Mewk Chorosap wants it delivered to her. If possible-wossible, can you take it there for me?
17428 : How're things?
17429 : Hmm... That was a request by a Tarutaru girl from Adoulin. I remember-wember it because that was the first time that somebody had ordered something other than food from us.
17430 : Unfortunately, you're too late. She asked me to send it to Jeuno, so that's justaru what I did.
17431 : I imagine it has already been delivered to Mewk Chorosap in Port Jeuno by now. You should go and take a look.
17432 : Ahh, welcome! Take a look at this delicious looking bread on this emblem-wemblem. I made it the other day. For some reason, it was being used as a pot lid...
17433 : Hm? You need it for something-womething? Sure, feel free to take it then!
17434 : Uwah! It's finished at lastaru!
17435 : Look at that tasty-looking emblem! It's rather-wather unfortunate that it can't be eaten.
17436 : I bet if we used this as a frying pan to cook with, we could make all kinds of delicious dishes-wishes...
17437 : At any rate, good work out there. Here, I have something to reward you for your effortaru.
17438 : This should help you cook up quite a treataru! I hope you'll use it to bring joy to even more satisfied customers!
17439 : 0: # 1: # 2: # 3: #
17440 : You have entered the crafting target area.
17441 : Crafting the requested items in the current target area will count towards the number of items you are required to deliver them.
17442 : You have left the crafting target area.
17443 : # % remaining.
17444 : I would like to requestaru that you bring me some %. I think # more should do nicely.
17445 : Yes, this is simply perfectaru. Now I just need # more of the same.
17446 : Yes, this is simply perfectaru. Now I just need # more of the same.
17447 : Okay, that does it. I'll be sure to place my next requestaru with your guild.
17448 : It's doubly delightful to see you here for the #th anniversary, kupo!
17449 : As has become customary, I'd like to share one of the many celebratory messages that have come from the millions and millions of men and women around the planet.
17450 : Once again, wish you much happy in this wonderful #th anniversary, adventurer!
17451 : We would never have come this far without your help, and we've got a little event in store!
17452 : We are holding Mandragora Mania Madness this year, too!
17453 : Your friend, Chacharoon
17454 : As you can almost assuredly see, Chacharoon awaits you right over there, kupo!
17455 : We moogles eagerly look forward to challenging you, kupo!
17456 : Also, don't forget to grab your gifts, kupo!
17457 : Now then, go see Chacharoon. I'm sure you'll get a bang out of his game!
17458 : (Kupopo... We'll make you pay for crushing us in last year's Mandragora Mania!)
17459 : Take your gifts and go chat with Chacharoon, kupo!
17460 : Make sure you speak to Chacharoon, kupo!
17461 : Wait, don't tell me you lost your %!?
17462 : I guess I've got to gift you another one, kupo. Please try to be more careful this time.
17463 : [Hi there!/Hello, friend!] I see you got letter I give to moogle.
17464 : Happy 20th Vana'versary!
17465 : I hope you ready to play Mandragora Mania Madness!
17466 : Since this new game, would you like to check rules in manual?
17467 : Read the manual? Sure. No thanks.
17468 : Mandragora Mania Madness is a game in which players battle by placing different colored game pieces on a 4x4 playing area.
17469 : You use the white pieces (mandragoras), while your opponent uses the black pieces (corrigans).
17470 : The player to go first is determined randomly when the game begins. You will be able to adjust these settings yourself from the second game onward.
17471 : The first player to place four pieces so they align in a row will be declared the winner.
17472 : However, you will automatically be disqualified if you ever place three of your pieces in a row, so be mindful of your moves at all times.
17473 : Note that if you place your game pieces so that you have both three and four pieces in a row, the row with four pieces will take precedence and you will win the game.
17474 : If you place a game piece on either side of your opponent's piece, you will convert it into one of your pieces.
17475 : You can play anywhere from three to five games, and the first player to win three games is the winner.
17476 : Now, for an explanation on points.
17477 : You receive points after the completion of each game. The points are tallied using units known as mandy.
17478 : If you win the game, you will receive a number of points equal to the number of game pieces you have on the board. In the example shown, you will earn 8 mandy.
17479 : Even if you lose the game, you will receive a number of points equal to half the number of your game pieces on the board (rounded off to avoid fractions).
17480 : The first player to win three games gets to keep all of the points they have earned, although you won't get any points if you quit partway.
17481 : Occasionally, you might get to play a bonus game, where your pieces are pink (adenium) or feature a watermelon pattern (citrullus).
17482 : They are worth #x and #x the points, respectively, giving you the chance to quickly score a large number of points.
17483 : The key to victory is to not just try and place four pieces in a row, but to position your pieces in a way that forces your opponent to place three pieces in a row.
17484 : See? Is very easy! Ready to give try?
17485 : You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!
17486 : Can trade mandy for many goodies.
17487 : Then I just give one piece of advice.
17488 : You get mandy if you win or lose, but not if you quit partway!
17489 : You can look at manual later if you need reminder on how to play.
17490 : Let's get to playing!
17491 : Have question?
17492 : Do which? (# mandy) Play vs. [Green Thumb Moogle/Monsieur Kupont/Susuroon/a lamb/Yeestog/Atelloune/Kuyin Hathdenna/Kupofried/Chacharoon/Sakura/a random opponent]. Play (select opponent). Purchase prizes. Read an explanation. None of the above.

17498 : You already have %.
17499 : You may only purchase one of those per day (Earth time).

17528 : Hrm. What's that you have there? It couldn't be...%?
17529 : Hrmmm. How could someone not of our fair federation-wation come into possession of such a missive?
17530 : Hrm. Hrmmm... Hrmmmmmm!
17531 : The indignity of someone rushing into the Doll Chamber-Wamber and making off with something so precious!
17532 : Whatever is the world coming to!?
17533 : This star-crested summons must be of great importaru indeed.
17534 : I cannot avertaru my gaze from such a crime! As the Optistery's tippity-top official, I must take action-waction.
17535 : Should the Optistery turn its back on ills befalling Windurstaru, our standing would surely fall.
17536 : Adventurer, what I am about to tell-well you must not leave these hallowed halls.
17537 : When I was but a nameless scribe, Karuha-Baruha, former head of the Optistery, mentioned the existence of the Doll Chamber-Wamber to me.
17538 : Great mages who have long since passed on left behind a magic homunculus of sorts, which we kept locked safe in the Doll Chamber.
17539 : When they walked Vana'diel, they had been charged with creating such specimen-wecimens and delivering them to Heavens Tower. A symbolic ritual, if you will.
17540 : I say symbolic, because it turns out that's all the gesture-westures amounted to--the homunculi were to be called upon in case a great tragedy befell Windurst. Fortunately, we have not had to use them as of yet.
17541 : Their stated purpose was to help locataru the great mages should they ever go missing and we needed to call upon their power.
17542 : The tale might stop there, were that the only thing they could be used for...but we discovered a far more sinister use.
17543 : In years past, the Sibyl of the age decided that we must neither dispose of them nor burn them to a crisp...
17544 : And truth be told, I think most of us wanted them sealed away forever, hoping-woping that their existence be banished even from the annals of memory.
17545 : But the Yagudo managed to steal one of them from us.
17546 : And the one they have in their clutches is the most fearsome of all...the homunculus created by the Maelstrom Mage, Garazu-Horeizu.
17547 : Inquire about what? Who is Garazu-Horeizu? What did he do? What happened to him?
17548 : Garazu-Horeizu is perhaps the most feared-weared mage in all Windurst's long history. Over 300 years ago, he brought all of Windurst to heel with his foul machinations.
17549 : It is not unheard of for power-hungry sorcerers to trample over anyone who would stand in the way of their quest to become ever stronger-wonger.
17550 : But Garazu-Horeizu was a fiend among fiends. He employed powerful hypnosis magic, also known as the maelstrom--hence his moniker-woniker.
17551 : Garazu-Horeizu was brazen in his lustaru for power.
17552 : He would conjure calamity upon all who dared defy him, and not even the words of the Star Sibyl could reach his blackened heart.
17553 : He turned his back on his fellow Windurstians, conniving with the Yagudo to bring ruin upon us all.
17554 : The ensuing conflict came to be known as the Fourth Yagudo War.
17555 : Two students--the siblings Gurebu-Ogurebu and Medada--managed to projectaru a false image to throw the Yagudo forces into chaos, sending them scattered to the four winds...
17556 : ...but the more one examines Garazu-Horeizu, the more shiver-wivers get sent up one's spine.
17557 : Records state that Garazu-Horeizu fell in the Fourth Yagudo War.
17558 : Perhaps the most perplexing part of his death-weath was the presence of a demon--a being thought at the time to be mere legend.
17559 : It was believed that demons only appeared during the midst of world-changing conflicts, and their mere existence was thoughtaru to be a fairy tale by many.
17560 : I suppose this apocryphal tale must be taken with a grain of saltaru, but Karaha-Baruha certainly seemed to place some stock in it.
17561 : Garazu-Horeizu had been studying the prime avatars...so who can say what his true goal was. Hrmmm...
17562 : Hrmmm!
17563 : And now that I've shared this tale with you, I have a requestaru--help us get back Garazu-Horeizu's homunculus.
17564 : It would be cause for concern even if the creation contained only a fragmentaru of his power, but I fear it contains his profane nature as well.
17565 : Yagudo keep all their most prized possessions deep within a vault in Giddeus. You may be able-wable to lay claim to your quarry there, if you hurry.
17566 : Please make haste--and do be discreet about it.
17567 : Adventurer, we must reclaim possession of Garazu-Horeizu's homunculus with all due haste.
17568 : Yagudo keep all thier most prized possessions deep within a vault in Giddeus. You may be able-wable to lay claim to your quarry there, if you hurry.
17569 : We cannot wait for the five ministries to convene and make an official decision. Please make haste--and do be discreet about it.
17570 : Hrm. Is that the Maelstrom Mage's magicked-wagicked homunculus?
17571 : Hrmmm!? It's not?
17572 : I see. So your operation in Giddeus didn't quite go to plan.
17573 : My nextaru step is to figure out how to break the news to the other ministers in Heavens Tower.
17574 : Who knows what the Yagudo have planned for that foul thing!?
17575 : And they're planning on trading it to a rich Tarutaru in Windurst for some silly bauble?
17576 : There's only one merchant sufficiently lavish and malicious to barter-warter with them: Honoi-Gomoi in Windurst Waters.
17577 : Why, he is a descendant of Garezu-Horeizu, after all. He must be planning-wanning to utilize the homunculus to engage in perfidy.
17578 : Hrm. Hrmmm. Hrmmmmmm!
17579 : Maybe you've heard the tale of the magicked doll already?
17580 : It's not a legend I dare shout from the rooftops. In fact, I wish I could forget it...
17581 : But according to the story-wory, when the doll is manipulated using forbidden Manustery techniques...
17582 : ...the vengeful spirit of Garezu-Horeizu can be summoned back from Death's dark hall.
17583 : Could Honoi-Gomoi be aware of the legends of the dolls?
17584 : No. There is no way he could... Even if he did, would he know the Manustery rites to...
17585 : According to the tale, the spiritaru of Garezu-Horeizu can be summoned back from Death's dark hall.
17586 : But it would take a mage of near-unfathomable power to complete the incantation.
17587 : And for all his bluster, Honoi-Gomoi is just a layman. He would be unable to do anything by himself.
17588 : Hrm. Hrmmmmmm!
17589 : Although we have not yet gotten the cursed trinketaru back, I must commend you on having unraveled part of this infernal tapestry. Here's a token of my appreciation--and please forget everything we discussed today.
17590 : Including about that egg business-wusiness. Not that I could help you even if i wanted to.
17591 : Hrm! I told you to forget about the whole thing but...about the %...
17592 : Something aboutaru it seems familiar. Yes, I can picture a small Tarutaru playing like it was only yesterday...
17593 : Ah, adventurer! I think I know the children who were playing with the doll. Could you bring it to them?
17594 : Deliver the doll? Sure. No thanks.
17595 : Those children are always spotted near a warehouse by the wharf.
17596 : I don't think you'll receive-weive any compensation, but kindness is its own reward.
17597 : This place is a library, officially known as the Federal Book Repository for Magical Knowledge and Research and Book Repository of General Knowledges.
17598 : We have no use here for smelly, obnoxious-woxious children's toys.
17599 : Hrm.... Please don't go around telling everyone about something being stolen from the Doll Chamber.
17600 : I shall leave you here, for preparations to meet with the other ministers must be made.
17601 : Bring that % to the warehouse near the waterfront.
17602 : Hrmmmmmm... I must prepare to meet with the other ministers in Heavens Tower.
17603 : Hrm.... Please don't go around telling everyone about something being stolen from the doll chamber.
17604 : I must prepare to meet with the other ministers in Heavens Tower.
17605 : Ooof...I think I pulled my knee.
17606 : Y-you! What're you doing here?
17607 : Hmph! You won't get a word out of me, so don't even bother trying!
17608 : This is an explanation of the Assist Channel feature, which allows new and returning players to seek help from veteran adventurers.
17609 : You must take on the % Records of Eminence objective before receiving the explanation.
17610 : You must complete % before taking on the % Records of Eminence objective.
