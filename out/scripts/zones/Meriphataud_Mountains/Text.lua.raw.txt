6872 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6873 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6874 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6875 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6876 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6877 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6878 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6879 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6880 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6881 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6882 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6883 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6884 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6885 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6886 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6887 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6888 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6889 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6890 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6891 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6892 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6893 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6894 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6895 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6896 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6897 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6898 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6899 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6900 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6901 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6902 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...

6937 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.

6946 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
6947 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!

6951 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
6952 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6953 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
6954 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
6955 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
6956 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
6957 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6958 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
6959 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
6960 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
6961 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
6962 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
6963 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6964 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
6965 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
6966 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
6967 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6968 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6969 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6970 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6971 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6972 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.

7691 : What do you wish to know about? Basic rules. About the Petra. About Sprint. About Scout. About Gate Breach. About area-specific rules. About returning to battle. About special rules. Nothing at the moment.
7692 : Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word ballista means to throw a stone, and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.
7693 : The rules are simple. Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.
7694 : Players from both teams must search for Petras that a Herald has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as Rooks.
7695 : These Rooks can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their Petras into them.
7696 : Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.
7697 : Petras can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the Quarry (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.
7698 : Sometimes a player may find items other than Petras, such as potions. These temporary items can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).
7699 : Players can carry more than one Petra, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them. However, players will lose their Petras if they: (1) Successfully throw them into a rook. (2) Leave the area. (3) Are knocked out.
7700 : But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the Sprint command while in possession of a Petra. And, players can only use the Scout command if they carry one of the stones.
7701 : As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.
7702 : All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the Sprint command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain Petras.
7703 : However, remember that once a player has obtained a Petra, he or she will be unable to use the Sprint command. In its place, though, one may use the Scout command.
7704 : The locations of the Rooks are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.
7705 : Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate Rooks. However, another way is by using the Scout command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest Rook.
7706 : Finally, Scout can only be used when a player is carrying a Petra. Because Sprint cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.
7707 : So, a Petra has been obtained and a Rook located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.
7708 : There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.
7709 : To throw a Petra into a Rook, a player must first wait until the Rook's gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.
7710 : But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve Gate Breach status. Only then will his or her shots count.
7711 : This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.
7712 : Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.
7713 : The following match types are area-specific: All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains
7714 : Best of Three series rules are as follows: Winning a match will earn a nation one match point. The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for come-from-behind victories.
7715 : Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.
7716 : Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.
7717 : When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.
7718 : For more information on temporary items, refer to the special rules.
7719 : After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.
7720 : If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.
7721 : Please note that many of the rules previously considered special have been fully implemented. Also, several new special rules have been added.
7722 : Learn about which special rules? Temporary items. Ballista Points. Scoring restrictions. Gate Breach radius expansion. Resistance to Sleep. Open entries. Minimum level restrictions. Re-entry restrictions. Participant & Rook numbers. Experience Points. Return.
7723 : Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as temporary items for use at any time during the match.
7724 : Players can hold up to ten temporary items, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.
7725 : If players who possess ten temporary items find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.
7726 : Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.
7727 : Finally, the Heralds will collect temporary items when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.
7728 : Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is #.
7729 : While it is taken into consideration, scoring Petras is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.
7730 : Ballista Points can be traded for special vouchers, which may be exchanged for free temporary items at the start of new matches.
7731 : However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match. Speak with a Marshal directly after a match to register your points.
7732 : Players will only be allowed to score up to five Petras at a time. Also, a player's Gate Breach status will be automatically disengaged if a Petra is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.
7733 : All allies within a certain radius will achieve Gate Breach status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.
7734 : Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.
7735 : During the entry period, from #:, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.
7736 : In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced: Level 30 matches: 130
7737 : Level 40 matches: 3140 Level 50 matches: 4150 Level 60 matches: 5160 Unrestricted matches: 61
7738 : Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.
7739 : When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.
7740 : Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.
7741 : Read which chapter on B.P. Ranking? Basic Information. Registering Points. Rewards. Chevron & Title List. None.
7742 : Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.
7743 : Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register [his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.
7744 : After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.
7745 : If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, [he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special chevron as well as a new title.
7746 : There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as two different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty-two jobs.
7747 : Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, [he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.
7748 : Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.
7749 : However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.
7750 : Finally, checking someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.
7751 : View which chevron/title? 1st (overall). 2nd (overall). 3rd (overall). 4th-10th (overall). 1st (warrior). 1st (monk). 1st (white mage). 1st (black mage). 1st (red mage). 1st (thief). 1st (paladin). 1st (dark knight). 1st (beastmaster). 1st (bard). 1st (ranger). 1st (samurai). 1st (ninja). 1st (dragoon). 1st (summoner). 1st (blue mage). 1st (corsair). 1st (puppetmaster). 1st (dancer). 1st (scholar). 1st (geomancer). 1st (rune fencer).

7839 : I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...
7840 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
7841 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
7842 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7843 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7844 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7845 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7846 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7847 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7848 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7849 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7850 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7851 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7852 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7853 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7854 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7855 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7856 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7857 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7858 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7859 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7860 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7861 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7862 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7863 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7864 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7865 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
7866 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
7867 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
7868 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.
7869 : A mysterious power absorbs the malice!
7870 : Please select absorption value. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
7889 : You see a message engraved on the stone:
7890 : Drogaroga's Spine: Tarutaru for Spine of the Heavenly Dragon. It is made of that same mysterious white material as the holy crags.
7891 : However, this is the first I've seen so exposed. A good portion of it is suspended in open space, no less.
7892 : In San d'Oria, the papsque claims that they were monuments built by Altana in honor of the Elvaan. All believed him, but I feel that this cannot be true.
7893 : This is merely conjecture, but I feel they resemble some kind of road or pipeline... But carrying what? If only I could show my father.
7894 : The white crags, spines, points, and lines... What did my father discover at the end of his journey? I wish I knew.   --Enid Ironheart, 778 Crystal Era.
7895 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
7896 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7897 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7898 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7906 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
7907 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
7908 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
7909 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
7910 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
7911 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
7912 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
7913 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
7914 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
7915 : You've earned conquest points!
7916 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
7917 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
7918 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
7919 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
7920 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
7921 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
7922 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
7923 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
7924 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
7925 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
7926 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
7927 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
7928 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
7929 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
7930 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
7931 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
7932 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7933 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
7934 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
7935 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
7936 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
7937 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
7938 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
7939 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
7940 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
7941 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
7942 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
7943 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
7944 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
7945 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
7946 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
7947 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
7948 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
7949 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
7950 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
7951 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
7952 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.

7954 : So be it. You have until the next conquest results announcement to complete this mission. Good luck.
7955 : We will dispose of those unusable supplies.
7956 : You can only undertake one supply mission per day. Come back later.
7957 : I am sorry. We seem to have a problem. Let me cancel it.
7958 : You do not need to donate any more crystals at your current rank. Speak to the guard at the gatehouse for further instructions.
7959 : Your rank points are full. We've added the excess to your conquest points. You do not need to donate any more crystals. Go to the gatehouse for further instructions.

7964 : Currently there are no items available for that rank.
7965 : Due to its special nature, you can only purchase or recharge % once until the conquest results tally is performed. Also, you cannot purchase this item if a similar item is already in your possession.

8012 : We are currently on a beastman-purging campaign. We support adventurers from all nations. Do your best to rid the world of those vile creatures.
8013 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
8014 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
8015 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
8016 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.

8022 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
8023 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
8024 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.

8027 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.

8030 : Quit the E.F.? Yes. Change locations. No.
8031 : Are you sure?
8032 : Really quit the E.F.? Yes. No.
8033 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
8034 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
8035 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
8036 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
8037 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
8038 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
8039 : You received # conquest points!
8040 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
8041 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
8042 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
8043 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
8044 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
8045 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
8046 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
8047 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
8048 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
8049 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
8050 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
8051 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
8052 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
8053 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
8054 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
8055 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
8056 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
8246 : PAUSE
8248 : I am the will of the realm's guardian wyrms made manifest, and in accordance with the Far Eastern calendar, this year belongs to us! May the soil be fertile and the harvests bountiful in the coming months.
8249 : I am the will of the realm's guardian wyrms made manifest, and in accordance with the Far Eastern calendar, this year belongs to us! May the following words guide you to fertile soils and bountiful harvests in the coming months.
8250 : What do we have here!? I cannot recall the last time I partook of a shell bug. Mmm...mhmmm...I had completely forgotten how vividly the flavor of these insects dances upon my palate. In return for your kind deed, adventurer, I impart to you the following... <Munch>...<smack>...
8251 : You currently stand in the eye of a raging maelstrom. Embark upon those winds and let them carry you to glory, obliterating all who dare defy you.
8252 : You exude a faint yet palpable aura of purification. Bathe your companions in the cleansing light to exorcise both their demons and yours.
8253 : The wheel of fate may creak and groan with age, but it spins in your favor. Where it stops, you shall find new alliances ready for the making.
8254 : Your corporeal frame is but a pyre that fuels an eternally burning spiritual conflagration. Use that passion to blaze your own trail to the path of righteousness.
8255 : You exude a comforting aura that blankets those around you. Wrap your companions in its warmth and their problems should melt away.
8256 : Your inner spirit is attuned to the sonorous melody that fortune emits. Lend it your ear in times of trouble, and you shall never lack for guidance.
8257 : The [orange/1/2/3/red/red/blue/blue/yellow/yellow/green/green/indigo/indigo/violet/violet] light... I can feel its power run through me.
8258 : Come, %.  Follow me...
8259 : Carbuncle vanished off in the direction of the La Theine Plateau.
8260 : Carbuncle vanished off to another area in the La Theine Plateau.
8261 : The % jumps in your hands.
8262 : Ahahahahaha! I can sense the power of the ring! Get yourself moving [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
8263 : Ahahahahaha! Don't slow down now, slacker! The readings are coming from the [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
8264 : Ahahahahaha! You're getting close now! I can feel the ring's power from the next area!
8265 : Ahahahahaha! You're almost on top of it! It's somewhere in this area!
8266 : The air here is warmer than the surrounding area...
8267 : %, is this not amazing?
8268 : Behold! A dragon, after all this time...
8269 : You have done well, %. Now step back.
8270 : You are about to witness the rebirth of a true dragoon!
8271 : Stay where you are! Take a single step, and this dragon's life is forfeit...
8272 : Cyranuce! I've come too late...!
8273 : Ahahaha...! How I've waited for this! The seal you have placed upon me is broken, Rahal Dragonslayer.
8274 : So you still walk among us, Cyranuce!
8275 : Hah! That half-witted beastmaster was the one crushed to death in the cell.
8276 : With the blood of this infant wyrm, my transformation into full dragon form will be complete!
8277 : Cyranuce... You will not become the dragon. The dragon will consume you...!
8278 : Stay back! This wyvern will grow to maturity knowing only the need for revenge in its heart...
8279 : Even though it has committed no sin, it is my duty as a dragonslayer to exterminate wyverns that bear the unholy sign.
8280 : Hmm, this wyvern is rare, for it bears neither mark. ...However, it is not the only one I have encountered.
8281 : I once witnessed the birth of a wyvern that was free of either sign. And the person who forged a pact with that wyvern was my friend...Cyranuce.
8282 : But as it grew, the unholy sign began to emerge. I stripped Cyranuce of his powers and locked him in the oubliette, hoping it would slow down the wyvern's increasing hold on his spirit.
8283 : It was all in vain... If only I had slain that wyvern when I had the chance! Now, I must finish off this creature to prevent the same tragedy from happening again!
8284 : ...We may need its power in our search for Cyranuce.
8285 : For the moment, I will give the care of this wyvern over to a friend of mine. He will nurse it back to health. But once we have tracked down Cyranuce, it dies by my hand. Understood?
8286 : Cyranuce, I still believe in you... You must believe in me, too.
8287 : % gently lays the % to rest in the earth...
8288 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
8289 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
8290 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
8291 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
8292 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
8293 : Now, listen close...
8294 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
8295 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
8296 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
8297 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
8298 : .........listen......
8299 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
8300 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
8301 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. The Holy Crest.
8305 : Hm? What is this? %? How do I know this is not some [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] trick?
8306 : Step back, adventurer! I've got much more important things to worry about now!
8307 : What!? A surprise attack by the beastmen!? And today, of all days...
8308 : In a matter of hours, a handful of new squires will be joining our ranks here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8309 : These young patricians are quite spirited, but they lack valuable battle experience.
8310 : While we need be cautious not to disgrace their family names, we cannot let them fall in battle. We request your assistance in protecting the future of San d'Oria!
8311 : It will not be long before a caravan of traders in search of new trade routes arrives here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8312 : If they were to be injured by the enemy, the economy of San d'Oria could fall into chaos. We request your assistance in protecting the prosperity of our kingdom!
8313 : A group of Temple Knights is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe our daily work.
8314 : Ah, but perhaps this could be a perfect chance to show those pampered sissies that being a true knight comprises more than just chasing about shoplifters and sweeping the chateau gardens. However, no matter how much of a grudge we may hold, we cannot let our Elvaan brothers and sisters fall in battle. Understood?
8315 : In a matter of moments, members of the Royal Guards will be arriving here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare us for our next campaign against the beastmen.
8316 : If the fiends are conniving a surprise attack, I expect you to do your best in assuring that no disgrace will be brought upon the guards' names, as well as preventing any unnecessary bloodshed.
8317 : Today, our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] is blessed with the honor of welcoming an ambassador from the fine Republic of Bastok.
8318 : If anything were to happen to our guest, it could transpire into war between our two nations. I expect you to protect the attach with your very life!
8319 : In a few moments, a new batch of legionary recruits will be enlisted to the Republican Army and dispatched here to the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8320 : However, within their ranks are future scientists and craftsmen. Their deaths would be a great loss for the future of our nation.
8321 : We must ensure their safety, but we also must be careful not to prevent them from fulfilling their duties. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8322 : In a matter of minutes, a group of mariners will be arriving at our outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] for self-defense training.
8323 : We must provide them with battle experience, but we also must ensure their safety. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8324 : My sources indicate that a party of Gold Musketeers carrying supplies is approaching the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8325 : These soldiers are the best of the best, and more than likely will not require any assistance in the event of an attack. However, if anything were to happen to them...
8326 : Later today, a group of high-ranking officials from Strategic Command will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to prepare for Bastok's next campaign against the beastmen.
8327 : If anything were to happen to the commanders, you and I would both be court-martialed! The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8328 : I have just received word that a group of ambassadors from the Federation of Windurst is en route to this outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to observe what measures Bastok has undertaken to maintain stability in the regions under Republican control.
8329 : If the attachs were to be injured on this occasion, the damage suffered to our nations' relationship would be irreparable. The Republic is counting on your assistance!
8330 : Shortly, we will be conducting a test for our mercenary candidates here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8331 : This exam is to help us judge the candidates' skill in battle and help us separate those with talent from those who are bound for deskwork.
8332 : But after an attack by the beastmen...there won't be any candidates left to grade! You've got to help us give these kids a fighting chance!
8333 : It won't be long before a party of Federation scholars will be arriving here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to do research on the local wildlife.
8334 : These scientists are more powerful with their pens than their swords...but that won't help them against a beastman attack! You've got to help us protect them!
8335 : Hmmm... Later today, a small group of Wize Wizards will be arriving to observe our daily work here at the outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands].
8336 : I say that we give them something to remember! %! It's up to you to prove to those bigwigs that we are the ones who maintain the peace in the Federation! Give those beastmen all you've got! (Just don't let the Wize Wizards get hurt...)
8337 : Today, a party of Federation Patriarchs is scheduled to arrive at the outpost here in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] to plan for Windurst's next campaign against the beastmen.
8338 : If anything were to happen to them, we'd all be reassigned to latrine duty! If you know what's good for you, you won't let anyone lay a finger on them!
8339 : Oh, why did the military attachs from San d'Oria have to come to our outpost in [Ronfaure/Gustaberg/Sarutabaruta/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Derfland/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/the Elshimo Lowlands/the Elshimo Uplands] now?
8340 : I shudder to think what would happen if an ambassador was injured...or worse! Get out there and protect those Elvaan with your life!
8341 : Excellent work! Your efforts helped protect the future of our nation. Divide this among your companions.
8342 : Our nation suffered an enormous loss today. We must begin reinforcing our defenses immediately!
8343 : Your inability to complete the mission has led to our defeat. The last thing our nation needs is an incompetent adventurer!
8344 : You fought hard, and you proved yourself worthy. You are a great asset to the nation.
8345 : We commend you on your services in helping us avert the beastmen's attack. I do not see them attacking us again any time soon.
8346 : This area is currently conducting a Ballista match. I have no time to trouble myself with your beastman trinkets.

8487 : Need more cards!
8488 : ......?
8489 : Lookin' for cards in all the wrong places.
8490 : This chocobo riding is a lot more painful than it looks. I think I'm starting to chafe.
8491 : I wonder how much I could get for this at the local pawnshop...
8492 : Would somebody explain to me why we're collecting these things again?
8493 : Digging holes in the dirt... Yeah, this is my idea of excitement.
8494 : % digs up # strange trading [card/cards] and places [it/them] in the treasure pool.
8495 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
8496 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!
8497 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8498 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip the %, kupo!
8499 : I can't work my moogle magic while you're involved in other events, kupo!
8500 : Time elapsed: # [hour/hours] (Vana'diel time) # [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] (Earth time)

8511 : Kweh! Kweh! Kwehhh! (You've found a treasure chest!)
8512 : You cannot open that treasure chest.
8513 : Your chocobo seems a little fatigued.
8514 : Your chocobo refuses to dig any more. Perhaps you should try another day.
8515 : You cannot retrieve the treasure chest just yet. Try again in a few moments.
8516 : KWEHHHHHH!!! (You've hit the jackpot!)
8517 : Your chocobo seems especially sharp today!
8518 : Your chocobo seems especially energetic today!
8519 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
8520 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
8521 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
8522 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
8523 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
8524 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
8525 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
8526 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
8527 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
8528 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
8529 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
8530 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
8531 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
8532 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
8533 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8534 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
8535 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
8536 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
8537 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
8538 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
8539 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
8540 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
8541 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
8542 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
8543 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
8544 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
8545 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.

11649 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11650 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
11651 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
11652 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
11653 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
11654 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
11655 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
11656 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
11657 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
11658 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
11659 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
11660 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
11661 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
11662 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
11663 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
11664 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
11665 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
11666 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
11667 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
11668 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
11669 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
11670 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
11671 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!
11672 : Choose a location: West Ronfaure. East Ronfaure. La Theine Plateau. Valkurm Dunes. Jugner Forest. Batallia Downs. North Gustaberg. South Gustaberg. Konschtat Highlands. Pashhow Marshlands.

11674 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there, kupo!
11675 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
11676 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
11677 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
11678 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
11679 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
11680 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
11681 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
11682 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
11683 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
11684 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
11685 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
11686 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
11687 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
11688 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
11690 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
11691 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
11692 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
11693 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
11694 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
11695 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
11696 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
11697 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
11698 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
11699 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
11700 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

11800 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11801 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11802 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11803 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11804 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11805 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11806 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11807 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11808 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11809 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11810 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11811 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11812 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11813 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11814 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11815 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11816 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11817 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11818 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11819 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11820 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11821 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11822 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11823 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11824 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11825 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11826 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11827 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11828 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11829 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11830 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11831 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11832 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11833 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11834 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11835 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11836 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11837 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11838 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11839 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
