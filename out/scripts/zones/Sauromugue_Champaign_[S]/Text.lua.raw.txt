6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

6910 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
6911 : So far, we've only taken down # [enemy/enemies] today!
6912 : How many enemies have we defeated? Only #. You can count that high, right...?
6913 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
6914 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
6915 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.
6916 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6917 : We've only beaten # [enemy/enemies] so far. Don't tell me you're tired already!?
6918 : Only # [enemy has/enemies have] fallen to us today! We're just getting started!
6919 : The last enemy we defeated was number #.
6920 : The last enemy we took down was number #.
6921 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
6922 : Only # [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.

6924 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
6925 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
6926 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...
6927 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6928 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
6929 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
6930 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6931 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
6932 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
6933 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
6934 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
6935 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.

6937 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
6938 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
6939 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
6940 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
6941 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6942 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
6943 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
6944 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
6945 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6946 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6947 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6948 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6949 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6950 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
6951 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7099 : What can I help you with? Nothing. Performance assessment. New Allied Tags. Temporary items. Union registration. Teleportation. Information on the Allied Campaign.
7100 : What would you like to know? Nothing. I'm sorry. About performance assessment. About Allied Tags. About temporary items. About Unions.
7101 : I am sorry, but at this time, I cannot be of any assistance in that area.
7102 : Understood. I shall now judge your performance and award the proper remuneration.
7103 : Ah, I'm sorry to inform you that your performance has not earned you any compensation.
7104 : Understood. I shall prepare a new set of tags for you now.
7105 : You've already undergone an evaluation for this battle, or had you forgotten? As much as I'd like to, I'm forbidden from providing you with a new set of Allied Taegs until the next battle begins.
7106 : Anyone wearing Allied Tags while participating in a campaign battle will be judged on their overall performance.
7107 : Soldiers will be evaluated not only on their fighting skills, but also on how much they contribute to the efforts of their allies through means such as healing and enhancing.
7108 : However, beware that if you leave the area before being assessed, you will be deemed a deserter and will forfeit all rewards earned that day.
7109 : Also, while there are no immediate penalties for being knocked out, falling in battle will significantly lower the score given to you.
7110 : When you are ready to receive compensation for your work on the field, return to me and I shall assess your performance and provide you with your payment.
7111 : Allied Tags are a special type of identification given to all participants of Allied Campaign battles.
7112 : There are benefits, as well as drawbacks, to wearing the tags. One of the benefits is that in the case you are knocked out on the battlefield, you will not lose any experience points.
7113 : However, some of the drawbacks include the inability to improve skills and earn experience points for individual kills, as well as the right to loot fallen enemies.
7114 : Temporary items can be purchased in exchange for Allied Notes.
7115 : There are several different varieties of items, but they all have one thing in common--they can only be used on the battlefield they were issued.
7116 : It is highly recommended that you first survey a battle's conditions and then select the supplies that you believe will benefit you most.
7117 : Please remember that all temporary items you carry on your person will be confiscated in the event that you leave the area.
7118 : You can only purchase temporary items if your nation of allegiance is commanding the campaign.
7119 : That is all.
7120 : I will require a teleportation fee of # Allied Note[/s]. I see you currently possess #.

7145 : I am sorry, %, but your campaign medal has expired. I cannot issue tags to anyone not authorized by the Allied Forces. Return to your nation's capital and speak with a Campaign Evaluation Official.
7146 : Oh ho! Keen to join a Union, are we? Very well. Listen up and I shall tell you all you need to know.
7147 : In order to better coordinate Allied efforts against the beastman menace, we have instituted a system of ad hoc tactical regiments called Unions. With five units to a battlefield, union registration is open to any proven soldier in possession of Allied Tags.
7148 : In return for their aid in advancing the war effort, union registrants will be eligible to earn a share of the spoils of war.
7149 : Needless to say, the choicest rewards will be reserved for those unions which make the greatest contributions in combat. Prove your mettle on the field of battle, and you will earn glory for your union, as well as a sizable bounty of your own.
7150 : Be forewarned that your commitment to your union comes first and foremost. In the aftermath of battle, you will not be permitted to reap rewards from your individual exploits until your union has distributed its plunder.
7151 : Caution! If a union member joins or leaves an existing party, that party's treasure pool will be distributed automatically and immediately.
7152 : Register for a union? Yes. No.
7153 : [Transfer/Resign] from your current union? Yes. No.

7313 : Hey, you're in the way. We fortifyin' this here wall to withstand the beastmen's siege turrets. So how's about just gettin' outta here before you get hurt.
7314 : Unless you're willin' to wipe that helpless look off your face and lend us a hand. That'd be a different story.
7315 : Assist with the fortifications? Show them how it's done! Refuse to help. Ask for an explanation.
7316 : Alright! That's the spirit! Let's get a move on, then.
7317 : Hmph, I figured as much by lookin' at you. Beat it, then. This is no place for tourists.
7318 : Like I said, in preparation for an enemy assault, we're workin' to fortify these defensive barriers. If you're willin', I'd like to place you in charge of managin' these here craftsmen as they go about it.
7319 : To be more precise, once you get to each craftsman's position, you have to tell 'em exactly what I'm about to tell you. Namely, what type of crystal they need to be usin'. That's all there is to it.
7320 : The young Elvaan wearin' the red hat is a blacksmith. Make sure he's using fire crystals.
7321 : The adorable little Tarutaru with the blonde braids is laying plaster. Gonna have to get her on some ice crystals.
7322 : The Hume lady is a stonemason, and a darn good one. She's gonna be needin' wind crystals.
7323 : That old coot of an Elvaan with the huge axe strapped across his back is a carpenter. Famous 'round these parts. Make sure you get him workin' with earth crystals.
7324 : May not look it, but the Mithra with the black kerchief wrapped 'round her noggin is an architect. She's gonna need her lightning crystals.
7325 : That sprat of a Tarutaru wearin' the blue getup's a handy lil' plumber. Surin' he'll be wantin' his water crystals, no doubt.
7326 : The good-looking fella in all white does scaffoldin'. Young Hume lad. See to it he's usin' light crystals.
7327 : The lady Elvaan's a painter. Handles a brush like nobody I never seen. Need dark crystals in that line of work. And that's it.
7328 : Ahhh, one more thing. If you're too late issuin' your orders, they're liable to up and leave their posts. So be right, and be quick.
7329 : Choose a crystal! Fire crystal. Ice crystal. Wind crystal. Earth crystal. Lightning crystal. Water crystal. Light crystal. Dark crystal. Plumb give up.
7330 : Hey now, you're runnin' this here operation! You can't just quit! There's no quitting in war!
7331 : Wow... You sure botched that job. All them wrong orders threw the craftsmen off kilter. They're demandin' a new foreman.
7332 : Well, the good news is you're gettin' your orders right. The bad news is that you're takin' your sweet time doing it. We'll never be ready for the Beastmen at this rate.
7333 : Come on, now! You even want to win this war!? The craftsmen are startin' to strike thanks to your incompetence!

7338 : Ah, you must be %. We've been expecting you.
7339 : The delivery took you # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7340 : The delivery took you # [minute/minutes] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7341 : While you were dawdling your way here, a separate shipment of construction materials was delivered to us. We shan't be requiring anymore.
7342 : I commend you on your expeditiousness. Thanks to you, the construction work on our provision storehouse here can proceed as planned.
7343 : So you have something to aspire to, the quickest delivery thus far was made by %. That indefatigable soldier traversed the same course as you in just # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7344 : You're the current quickest delivery record holder, with a lightning-fast time of # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time). But that's no excuse to slack off, you hear?
7345 : Time elapsed: # [hour/hours] (Vana'diel time) # [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] (Earth time)
7346 : You find nothing out of the ordinary.
7347 : A shiver runs down your spine...
7348 : Perhaps you should first attend to more pressing matters...
7349 : Something tells you that you should wait a moment and try again.
7350 : I am far too busy to speak with you now. Perhaps I'll have a little time later.
7351 : Good show on your last operation. Now go make an official report to Sir Rasdinice.
7352 : Good work on that last operation. Now report back to First Centurion Hieronymus before he has your hide!
7353 : Nice job on your last operation. Now don't forget to report back to Emhi Tchaoryo!
7354 : It seems that you were not successful in your last operation. But do not let one small failure hang heavy on your soul. Report to Sir Rasdinice and put this all behind you.
7355 : Weren't so lucky during that last operation, were you? Well, don't worry about it too much. Report to First Centurion Hieronymus and get some rest, soldier.
7356 : Hmmm... Didn't do so well on that last operation, did you? I know it's hard, but it's better if you're up-front about these things. If you know what's good for you, you'll hurry down and report to Emhi Tchaoryo before the major finds out first.
7357 : Make haste, %. Sir Rasdinice awaits your report!
7358 : What are you waiting for, %? Report to First Centurion Hieronymus on the double!
7359 : Why are you wasting your time chatting with me? Shouldn't you be reporting to Emhi Tchaoryo?
7360 : Good work, soldier. [The Kingdom/The Republic/The Federation] thanks you for your cooperation.
7361 : I am charged with the provisioning of supplies for our troops out on the battlefield. I can issue you temporary items in exchange for Allied Notes.
7362 : Select a temporary item. (Price) Nothing at this time. Browse another page. %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) Next page. Previous page.

7364 : Browse which page? Never mind. Page 1. Page 2. Page 3. Page 4.
7365 : It appears you're already in possession of one. I'm sorry, but we can only afford to issue supplies to those who are most in need.
7366 : I'm sorry, but we're fresh out of stock for that item.
7367 : You must attain a higher rank if you wish to be issued %.
7368 : Is there anything else you require?
7369 : Let the Blade of the Conqueror once again bring glory to the Kingdom!
7370 : Gwahahaha! Let me cool you off a little before I send you to hell!
7371 : Father! Lend me your strength!
7372 : For the king!
7373 : My spear is lightning...and your scream shall be the thunder which follows my mighty strike!
7374 : Ha hah! Your arrows cannot pierce the iron will of a true knight!
7375 : This arrow to your heart shall be Altana's final judgment.
7376 : Shogyo Mujo! Zesho Meppo! Shometsu Metsui! Jakumetsu Iraku!
7377 : There is no escape...save death!
7378 : Altana! Let your divine light guide us to victory!
7379 : You barbarians will regret the day you set foot on Bastokan soil!
7380 : Ryaaaaaaaaah!
7381 : Men! Do not fear the enemy! It is our blades they shall fear!
7382 : A swift end is the only mercy you will receive from me, fiends!
7383 : Watch carefully, because this is the last thing you'll ever see in this life!
7384 : I never liked fighting on land... Now, give me a well armed battleship on the open sea, and I'll have those turtlebacks running for their lives!
7385 : A soldier always comes prepared! Hehehehe!
7386 : To your seats, boys! The show is about to begin!
7387 : Ahahahaha! My hand slipped!
7388 : This is your last chance. Throw down your weapons and your life will be spared. If you refuse...
7389 : The gates to the underworld have opened! I'll see you on the other side...or not! Wahahahahah!
7390 : There is nothing more magnificent than the dance of flames on the battlefield!
7391 : <Phew!> I think I've had enough of this volume!
7392 : Guttler: Guttler thirsty! Guttler want blood! More blood!
7393 : Time to go to work!
7394 : Invincible! Indestructible! Indubitable! The age of the Cardians is upon us!
7395 : You, over there. No, wait! You're supposed to be on that side! Hold on, which one were you again? Arrrghhh!
7396 : <Snorrre>... Is that the best you can do?
7397 : Petty beastman hordes are nothing compared to giant wildebeests of homeland! I swat you all down like fruit flies!
7398 : <Yawn>... Um... Holy light...show the way...?
7399 : The protection of the throne comes before all else. Only by direct order of the royaulais will I wield my blade on the battlefield. Such is the duty of the Royal Guards.
7400 : Hah hah hah! The ringing of steel upon steel! The dripping stench of the battlefield! What could be better than war? The nobles can have their balls, I'll do my dance on the front lines!
7401 : How dare a baseborn peasant raise [his/her] voice to a noble knight!? Begone, before I strike you down myself!
7402 : The Kingdom's defeat at Jugner still stings. To avenge the souls of those lost on that fateful day, we must join hands and take up arms as one.
7403 : Not once in the four hundred years since the dawn of the Royal Knights has the Kingdom found itself in such peril. Let us take up our pikes and stand our ground to ensure another four centuries of prosperity!
7404 : It is often in times of strife that a man's true nature is revealed. Will you stand tall in the face of fear, or run and cower in the wake of your mother's dress?
7405 : While our holy doctrines specifically prohibit the taking of another life, you need not hesitate on the battlefield. The Church has branded the beastmen enemies of Altana. The purification must begin! It is the will of the Goddess!!!
7406 : After years of training in the Far East, I return only to find my nation burning at the hands of the infernal beastman hordes. The heathens shall pay dearly... My work has only just begun.
7407 : You have the look of a fine warrior. It is a pity you are not one of my Crimson Wolves.
7408 : The eyes of the Goddess are ever upon us. We must remain steadfast against the evils from without, as well as those from within.
7409 : The Republic was formed with the blood and sweat of the people. The flames of freedom must continue to light our furnaces of strength. The waters of civilization must continue to turn our wheels of ingenuity!
7410 : Turtle sleeps in a rocky den 'Cause he's not a citizen Strike him down with sword and stave Stick a blue flag in his grave
7411 : We may have the upper hand in technology and munitions, but the enemy's advantage lies in their sheer numbers. The Allied Campaign will not win in a day, soldier. Make every bullet count.
7412 : The Metalworks' strategies are too timid for my taste. The beastmen are nothing but dominoes, waiting to be toppled. A swift, aggressive assault is the only way to victory.
7413 : Move along, soldier. I have nothing to say to you.
7414 : Halt! If you're not one of the Fourth, then get your sorry tail over to the recruitment office on the double! And if you are one of us, then what the hell are you doing here talking to me!? Get back on the battlefield! About...FACE!
7415 : ...Heavy infantry, five columns of 200... Two 100-knight regiments... Enemy force casualties estimated at 5,000... Oh, I apologize, soldier. I've spent the past few nights preparing for a joint operation with San d'Oria's Royal Knights.
7416 : You look like you've seen better days, soldier. Let me guess, it's the war that's bringing you down. What you need is a little music in your life!
7417 : If it weren't for the Galkan heavy infantry, this nation wouldn't last a month against the turtlebacks. And what thanks do we get? A handful of stale army biscuits!
7418 : Have you ever stopped to ponder what that comet might truly portend? I'd like to believe it is a message of hope--that soon this age of darkness will come to a close...
7419 : Oh, whatever has become of my sweet Windurst? Rabble running through the streets, streets overrun with rabble! Why are you even speaking to me!? Does the title Master Caster no longer garner even an onz of respect!?
7420 : Ah, the Fates have brought you to Gariri the Magnificent! Why am I thus called, you ask? Why, because only I was magnificent enough to decryptify those mysteriously marvelous Near Eastern tomes and open a window to...the Other Side!
7421 : We all wear masks because deep down inside we are nothing but beasts. The question I ask you is, to which do you submit--the mask, or the beast?
7422 : (Guttler! I told you to keep qui--) Ahahahah... Don't mind me, I was just...uh...keeping myself company! (Shhh! If you open your mouth one more ti--) Ahahaha... Uh, were you still there?
7423 : If only the Parliament of Patriarchs would loosen the strings on their purses a little more, I would be outside right now roasting up a couple birdmen to snack on!
7424 : Have fun while you can, filthy mercenary, because before long you'll be back on the streets where you belong--replaced by a quiet, obedient army of Cardians!
7425 : Normally, it is my duty to protect the patriarchs of parliament, but with the fate of Windurst in doubt, I'm forced to lead my loyal pets to the front lines.
7426 : Do you like the headpiece? I made it from my firrrst victim. I wear it to let everrryone know what happens when they cross Mikhe Aryohcha!
7427 : Back in my home, Ulbuka, I hear rumors of great riches in eastern lands. But now I am here, and where are riches? I see nothing but Tarus! Ahahahaha!
7428 : <Yaaawn>... Mastering these Near Eastern magics can be quite taxing. If I had a choice, I'd rather be back in bed, relaxing...
7429 : I saved this one especially for you!
7430 : Hiiiiii-yah!
7431 : My dear pupil, Dalzakk. You still have much to learn...
7432 : Witness the true embodiment of my sorrow.
7433 : Heh heh heh!
7434 : <Giggle>...
7435 : Wheheheheh! You thirsty, Kopeh?
7436 : Come, Kilhwch! We must strike down the evil which stands before us!
7437 : My brothers and sisters! Raise your blades for justice!
7438 : Kilhwch! Silence those fiends!
7439 : To your feet, Kilhwch!
7440 : Lady Ulla. We must retreat.
7441 : How dare you!
7442 : The raven shalt spare nary a tear for thy demise.
7443 : Watch! And see how a real mercenary earrrns her wage!
7444 : Leave me be. The verge of battle is no time for words.
7445 : Fear not. My fists will guide us to victory.
7446 : My daughter awaits her father at home. I will permit no Beastman to delay my return.
7447 : Beyond this point lies the sealed royal tomb of King Ranperre. Tell me, %, do you believe the legends?
7448 : The Orc war machine draws near. We must brace ourselves for battle.
7449 : In former times, this island was inhabited by a ferocious tribe of vikings. It is said they braved vast expanses of open sea to arrive here. Romantic, don't you think?
7450 : Surely you have seen the tigers that roam these downs. They were brought from the northern continent by the Orcs themselves. They are highly prized for their luxurious pelts, though their bloodlust makes them formidable game.
7451 : The brotherhood of this place once welcomed me long ago. I pray that the years have been kind to them.
7452 : The Gold Musketeers of the Republican Army are marshalled by young woman. Such talk is sure to inspire my daughter.
7453 : Bastok was forced to abandon the Palborough Mines following a Beastman invasion. How an army such as the Republic's could permit such an affront baffles me to no end.
7454 : The village elder in La Vaule told me of the so-called wyrm deity of Grauberg. Of course, I am sure it is nothing more than folktales. Still, my curiosity is piqued...
7455 : Strange... I am certain the vegetation of this area is different from when I last visited. Surely I would not have allowed myself to forget such beautiful flowers.
7456 : Such devasation... Even the resilient Goobbue were not able to survive. I wonder if this place shall ever be restored to its former glory...
7457 : History tells us that it was in the year 381 that San d'Oria's iron-tempered  King Lanfeaur R d'Oraguille came these lands to strike a peace with the Quadav. Whatever happened to the bond that was formed...?
7458 : I have seen here two twins who between them share a power for magic the likes of which I have never seen. This is indeed a strange nation.
7459 : Unfortunate... I had always wished to gaze upon the fabled magic towers of West Sarutabaruta with my own eyes. Yet I fear I may be too late...
7460 : This fortress is lauded as the impregnable point of Windurst's defenses. Goddess forbid, should it happen to be taken, Windurst is unlikely to last more than a month's time.
7461 : These windblown sands reak havoc on my throat. I look forward to a cup of my daughter's fine Batallia tea.
7462 : Take heed, %. I have seen Beastman-dug battle trenches throughout these plains. Should you be found, your life is forfeit.
7463 : There is an ominous feeling in the air... This is no place to linger.
7464 : Never have I felt a cold as piercing as this. My teeth chatter and my toes grow numb. We would do well to find a place to warm ourselves.
7465 : I wonder if it was not somewhere near here where minister Francmage was dispatched on the Multinational Expedition some 10 years ago.
7466 : Never did I imagine the day would come that I would set foot in this accursed place. Has great is our foe's desperation? Do not lower your guard, %.
7467 : And so we breach the enemy's inner sanctum. Expect anything, %! And don't die on me!
7468 : As the Allied Forces have long maintained, this citadel would be ideally suited to the defense of Jeuno.
7469 : A well conceived strategy... A stronghold established under the cover of the nest of these vile crawlers. It is almost surely to be overlooked by the enemy.
7470 : Oh, mighty Altana, be the sword in my hand. With you, the swift cannot flee, nor the strong escape. Receive mine enemies, for the mercy of the Goddess embraces even the wicked.
7471 : Heh heh heh! Wonder what technique I should try out on these ol' beastmen chumps.
7472 : Haha... Who will be the next darling recipient of my spells?
7473 : Red blood, blue blood, any colorrr blood. If it bleeds, we can kill it!
7474 : What's taking so long? I'm getting all antsy-wantsy! My pets are I are all bad at staying still...
7475 : Do not fear. Righteousness will prevail. I shall show you victory!
7476 : Promise me one thing. Should anything happen to me... Look after my daughter.
7477 : I reckon I'll be earnin' my keep. Won't be doin' nothin' extra, though. Don't be expectin' me to risk my hide without my due an' proper, mm-hmmm.
7478 : Bravo really is a dear once you get to know him. It's just that in the heat of battle he... Well, you'll see.
7479 : My blade, Kyomon, anticipates much beastman blood. This battle may prove interesting, yet.
7480 : Look to me, mortals! And be haunted for the rest of your brief time in this world!
7481 : For a split second, you thought you saw Titania turn and shoot you a tiny smile.
7482 : The flower atop Babban Ny Mheillea's head appears to be in full bloom!
7483 : Ribbit! Ribbit!
7484 : You'd better watch your back!
7485 : Don't take this personally, but I've got children to feed.
7486 : Time to have some fun!
7487 : Reckon it's time tuh earn my keep, mm-hmm.
7488 : Come now, Bravo! It's high time we taught these beasts what a wyvern is truly capable of!
7489 : Hehe, so many willing to be sacrificed!
7490 : Hmph. Perhaps I should just burn the eyes of these infidels with my true form.
7491 : I fear not death, for the Goddess awaits us with open arms.
7492 : It is not yet your time.
7493 : Be strong, for the Goddess is with you, always.
7494 : Return to the dust whence you came! Randgrith!!!
7495 : Saints and heroes...glory and despair... Of these I shall sing unto my dying breath.
7496 : When work has ended stay not late. Return to where thy dearest awaits.
7497 : O gentle Goddess of the Dawn, thou brighten the black of night. Hear our song and heed our call, and bathe us in your delight.
7498 : Press forward valiant soldiers, glory draws nearer still. Thy deeds shall resound forever, by my stirring song fulfilled.
7499 : Loyal children of Altana, arise and be sustained. Be nourished in thine undying faith, and bask in victory's refrain.
7500 : Sing! Dance! Laugh, and cry! Let sweat rain down in floods! Ride upon this rhythmic beat, make seethe thy red life blood!
7501 : Dance thine elegant, airy steps that has won a thousand hearts. Enchant, enthrall, and captivate, treat none with disregard.
7502 : Honored am I to have this chance to share the same stage with you.

7717 : The Jeuno Straits separate our continent of Quon from the unknown lands of Mindartia. I was surprised to find it far narrower than I had thought.
7718 : Crossing the straits, I arrived in the Sauromugue Champaign, the gateway to Mindartia. The Royal Knights of San d'Oria built a castle here in the heyday of that kingdom's power.
7719 : The castle fell to a nighttime raid of three Tarutaru mages. The mighty knights routed, and their chocobos scattered. One by one they were driven into the straits. It became known as the Flight from Sauromugue.
7720 : I began my survey here, in this blood-soaked land that has won a place in the studies of every San d'Orian officer. But history is history. You cannot walk forward if you only look back.
7721 : I will befriend the Tarutaru and the Yagudo, so that peace may span across the continents.   --Enid Ironheart, 770 Crystal Era.

7727 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?

7741 : The path through the Meriphataud Mountains is a treacherous one, with Yagudo zealots hiding behind every rock. Stay alert, or you may find yourself impaled on the end of one of their blades.
7742 : Stand down, civilian! You're not really thinking of journeying through the mountains, are you? You would be crazy to continue, and I would be even more so to allow you the opportunity.
7743 : Though, if you are eager to put your Goddess-granted life at risk, I can offer you a bit of advice.
7744 : The Kingdom of San d'Oria has begun fortifying a citadel located due northwest from this garrison. There are guards there who may be able to assist you on your travels.
7745 : There also may be someone with information on recruitment, if you are interested in lending your services to the allied forces.
7746 : Who knows... The next time we meet, I might have to call you sir.
7747 : A prompt arrival, as always. Welcome, %.
7748 : Your timing is as impeccable as ever. We were simply awaiting Machudiaux's return. He has gone ahead and is making the rounds, asking various questions of the sentries stationed in the area.
7749 : He should be back at any moment.
7750 : And here he comes now.
7751 : The soldiers attest that they were able to follow Fhen's tracks up until she entered Sauromugue Champaign.
7752 : We've taken into account all possible routes from Windurst. And checked every questionable area along the way. And still we found nothing.
7753 : In all likelihood, she was somewhere here in the champaign when she went missing.
7754 : Which means that she could very well still be in the area-warea...
7755 : Nay, she must be! I can feel it! Let us splitaru up and begin the search.
7756 : Hmph, hoping to find her and take all of the credit for yourself, are we?
7757 : I'm not usually prone to engage in your small-minded chatter-watter, Machudiaux. But you've caught me in a sporting mood. Keep it up and see what happens.
7758 : Oooh, the wee one has a murderous rage in her! I wonder, how would that head look without the ears and the nose on it?
7759 : <Sigh>... There they go again. Please break them up, would you?
7760 : What will you do? Squash it. Steer clear.
7761 : Stand down. This is not your fight.
7762 : You'll only be adding fuel to the fire. Best leave them be and we'll all meet up again when they've had some time to cool down.
7763 : How can you possibly engage in your mindless bickering at a time like this? We should begin searching for Fhen without delay!
7764 : Very well. In that case...
7765 : You two, cease your quibbling for now. We will split up and commence the search for Fhen.
7766 : %, was it?
7767 : Consider this a warning from a senior pupil. Don't assume that you are safe simply because you are in Allied-held territory.
7768 : Take care, and may the Goddess watch over us all.
7769 : I shall go my own way, as well.
7770 : You find yourself alone. Perhaps a search could turn up some sort of clue...
7771 : Among the rubble, a number of small stones are [strewn about/lined up neatly].
7772 : Will you investigate further? Yes, press on. No, back off.
7773 : ...%. I should have expected as much.
7774 : But as for Machudiaux... Well, despite your record of punctuality, it would seem this time you are just a tad late.
7775 : You must have somehow deduced how to use a porting stratagem to bring you here.
7776 : Well, allow me to bid you welcome to Ghoyu's Reverie. Home to spectacular multi-tiered geological strata, rare, gregarious cacti, and distinctive, fleshy plant life. A veritable paradise for any scholar.
7777 : Final destination, also, of all those missing magi that you so relentlessly seek.
7778 : Look to this cliff. The depths below are not even visible, such is its height. The ideal location for disposing of evidence, wouldn't you say?
7779 : What evidence, you ask? You disappoint me...
7780 : Even a junior pupil such as you should be able to solve that problem. Why, the corpses of your deserters, of course. What else?
7781 : And actually, while I'm at it... I suppose you would make a fine addition to that select group!
7782 : After all, we senior pupils must see to properly schooling even the most misbegotten of our juniors.
7783 : You see, by imbibing the blood of the magi, the grimoire is transmuted into its most primordial and powerful expression.
7784 : At first, I went to great lengths in limiting myself to feeding it only beastman magi. Capturing and testing the blood of Yagudo, Orcs, and what have you.
7785 : But it just didn't seem to be working out. Of course, with the gift of hindsight I now realize the naive folly of this initial attempt.
7786 : I then moved on to sating its thirst with the blood of those who were altogether unschooled in the contents of the grimoire itself. That, also, led to...unsatisfactory results.
7787 : And then, one day I found myself at an allied infirmary where a mage heavily wounded in combat was undergoing treatment. In desperation, I placed the grimoire to his wound and at long last found the result I was seeking!
7788 : The letters within began to take on a dull red sheen, pulsating in their newfound bloodlust.
7789 : And the rest, as they say, is history.
7790 : It took considerable effort to ascertain what type of blood was required to imbue each individual page.
7791 : I dare say, I even had the good fortune to encounter many pleasing surprises along the way which never fit into my original calculations. Thanks to the multinational investigation, for example, the quality and quantity of my quarry increased immensely.
7792 : What's that? The others will come to help you, you say?
7793 : If you truly believe that, then I fear I may have some bad news for you. Machudiaux, there, was the last.
7794 : I'm sure by now he has crossed over and joined his dear friend Fhen in the eternal war planner's room. I like to picture them engaged in heated, intellectual discourse over the intricacies of their own deaths!
7795 : Still, it pains me somewhat to have to drag in even the acquaintances of my colleagues. It just makes it harder to justify it all from a moral standpoint, you know?
7796 : And that brings us to you, %. You showed such marked progress and had such a promising future.
7797 : But, please. Do not feel discouraged. Your death will not be in vain, I promise you.
7798 : After all, in one manner of speaking, you will come to be the subject of my greatest scholastic achievement!
7799 : Wh--what was that!?
7800 : No matter. The completion of the true grimoire is at hand. Then I shall be one step closer to him. And unparalleled heights...
7801 : Hmm... Looks like all have arrived safe and sound.
7802 : Then I will begin the briefing.
7803 : The reinforcement troops with which we have been tasked with safely delivering--the Cancerian and Geminian War Warlocks--are at present advancing through rough terrain along the Beflahgi Highroad.
7804 : The projected route for the enemy forrrce, on the other hand, is...
7805 : %! You're joining in on the fun, too?
7806 : Hehehe, this is my first time being involved in a larrrge-scale operation. I can barely contain my excitement!
7807 : Can't contain is more like it, Tihl. You haven't stopped rrranting about it since we left Windurst!
7808 : What's wrrrong with getting a little giddy from time to time!? It's not often we get to fight under the command of genius tactician Master Lehko! This is our chance to imprrress!
7809 : Hey! No talking durrring briefing!
7810 : ...From here the road narrows down as it approaches a chasm.
7811 : Approximately one malm further down is where we will stage the ambush. Cheetah Volunteer riflerrrs are to perch themselves atop the chasm in firing positions.
7812 : Then, we wait patiently for the enemy to arrive. No one--absolutely no one--is to fire until I give the signal. You see to that, Naho.
7813 : No sweat!
7814 : <Sigh>... Master Lehko is even more charming when giving orders. So handsome...so intelligent... So...in charrrge!
7815 : This isn't the time to be swooning over authorrrity, Tihl. Snap out of it!
7816 : And Romaa. Your unit will form the strike force.
7817 : On my command, the Cobras are to storrrm the enemy's column and cut off their retreat.
7818 : Underrrstood.
7819 : Be warned, however, that the enemy's numbers grrreatly outnumber ours, making the risk of counter-flanking very real.
7820 : Both units, be prepared to pull out instantly when ordered to withdrrraw.
7821 : Sir, yes sirrr!
7822 : Underrrstood...
7823 : That's morrre than enough info we Cheetahs need to squash the enemy. Let them come, I say!
7824 : Hahaha. It's reassuring to be in the company of such spirrrited soldiers.
7825 : I have the utmost faith in you all.
7826 : <Blush>... Sir, yes sirrr!
7827 : ...
7828 : (Um...is the enemy coming or what?)
7829 : (You sure the intelligence is accurate? My tail's crrramping up from all this waiting!)
7830 : (Ow, my elbows are killing me! Hey, Mihl, you hearrring anything? Like footsteps and stuff?)
7831 : (Shhh! Keep it down or the boss'll clip us one on the ear!)
7832 : (Grrr! Hurry up and get here alrrready so I can make me some turtle soup!)
7833 : <Sniff, sniff>... Quiet, all of you.
7834 : There's no mistake about it--they're here!
7835 : ...!
7836 : Hmm...looks to be Quadav Heavy Infantry.
7837 : No warmachines to be seen...which would explain their nimble marrrching pace. Damn, this isn't their main force.
7838 : No, wait... These footsteps I'm hearing...
7839 : (Get rrready, girls. We're gonna mow them down in one go.)
7840 : ...Gigas! And lots of them!
7841 : Wh...what the hell are they!?
7842 : No-nobody told us about those...things!
7843 : ...
7844 : (At least a dozen Gigas... It'll be nigh on impossible to supprrress a counter-attack...)
7845 : (The operation must be executed as planned. Left to continue their advance unmolested, the beastmen will surely encounterrr and engage the War Warlocks no more than ten malms ahead.)
7846 : (The Warlocks are exhausted from their arduous journey, and will be severrrely disadvantaged if caught out in open ground.)
7847 : (But--!)
7848 : (Shhh. Trust me.)
7849 : (Just a little furrrther...)
7850 : No one fires until I give the command.
7851 : Hold... Hold...
7852 : Hold...
7853 : Open firrre!!!
7854 : Deftly done, ladies.
7855 : Now, reload and preparrre for the second volley! Don't allow the enemy time to pinpoint our position!
7856 : Cobras! Get ready to flank their column!
7857 : The next volley is your signal to scale down the chasm and storrrm their ranks!
7858 : Understood!
7859 : ...Unsheathe your weapons!
7860 : Take a deep brrreath...
7861 : Chaaaaaarrrge!!!
7862 : Don't let the foe intimidate you! Hold your ground!
7863 : ...!?
7864 : Whaaahhh!!!
7865 : Uhhhnnn...
7866 : On your feet! Now!
7867 : What happened to your spirited words earlierrr? Were they blown away by the wind?
7868 : ...
7869 : I-it's just...I've never seen anything of their like beforrre. Th-they're more than twice the size of Antica...
7870 : You're in a forrreign land, fighting on a foreign battlefield against foreign foes. Get used to it.
7871 : Listen up, and listen well. You will live only as long as you so desirrre.
7872 : Your rifle's firing mechanism may fail, and your blade arm may tire. But if you cease to fight, you will surely perrrish. On the battlefield, this is the only truth.
7873 : ...
7874 : The Cobras are going in for a second charrrge. We're counting on cover fire from your Cheetahs, Naho!
7875 : ...Un-understood.
7876 : Doron-Fulun, if I may ponder, what is the commotion over yonder?
7877 : It appears to be a battle. The Mithran Mercenaries are engaged with...a large beastman force primarily composed of Quadav Shieldwarriors.
7878 : ...Of all the nerve!
7879 : Huh...?
7880 : If ever there was something that truly makes me mad...
7881 : It's being left out of the action while fun is being had!
7882 : Maintain composure, my brave soldiers!
7883 : After their next charge is repelled, we withdrrraw! Retreat west as fast as your feet will carry you!
7884 : M-Master Lehko! Are you unharrrmed!?
7885 : ...Magic? Where did that come from?
7886 : West...it came from the west, sir!
7887 : One of our own!? The usage of magic in the operation was exprrressly forbidden!
7888 : Without my intervention, things would've gone from worse to worst. Surely, I'm undeserving of such an ungrateful outburst?
7889 : But I'm a compassionate woman with forgiveness in my heart. So I shall excuse this show of disrespect on your part.
7890 : C-could that trrruly be...
7891 : ...D-Doctor Shantotto!?
7892 : Ohohohohoho!
7893 : ...
7894 : Am I correct in assuming you to be Doctor Shantotto, Minister of the Orastery?
7895 : Actually, it's former Minister, if we were to be exact. Apart from that minor detail, though, your assumption is quite intact.
7896 : And your companion is...?
7897 : I am Doron-Fulun, Master Caster of the Leonian War Warlocks.
7898 : Of our two identities, you've now been made aware. So care you to return the favor, and your name with us share?
7899 : I beg your parrrdon, Professor. I am Lehko Habhoka, newly appointed advisor to Warlock Warlord Robel-Akbel. It is a pleasurrre to make your acquaintance.
7900 : Has the Federation so suffered a migration of talent in my brief absence...
7901 : To have to forgo its dignity and let mercenaries plan its defense?
7902 : If I could once more be forgiven for my insolence, I'd like to point out that your unexpected interrrvention has completely derailed the diversionary operation.
7903 : And if my memory serves me correctly, you were sentenced to exile and stripped of all military authority?
7904 : That I still have authority, is a sincere misunderstanding. I'm but a simple civilian forced by the Master Caster to do his bidding.
7905 : Wh-wh-what!? But, M-Minister, I did no such thing!
7906 : First of all, it was you who coerced us all into coming here!
7907 : The Warlock Warlord will show no mercy should this misappropriation of the Leonian War Warlocks reach his ears! I-I'll never be able to set foot in Windurst ever again!
7908 : Doron-Fulun, why be troubled by a future that may not even happen, when my displeasure towards your poor attitude is growing and ever present?
7909 : Ulp!
7910 : Now, let us return to the business at hand. Did you truly think to succeed with your tiptoeing plan?
7911 : Your strategy is reminiscent of a pitiable litter of kittens, at the mercy of a ferocious pack of wolves, that for days have not eaten.
7912 : What did you say?
7913 : The Warlord Warlock, Goddess bless his bandaged face, is in dire need of a personnel department to have his people replaced.
7914 : Your beauteous countenance and venomous disposition farrr exceed your reputation, Doctor Shantotto.
7915 : (Oh geez, oh geez, here we go...)
7916 : !?
7917 : It appears your fireworks have attrrracted more guests.
7918 : In diversionary operations, the more the merrier rings true. Keep your two eyes peeled and you might learn a thing or two.
7919 : Hmm... Under the circumstances, I suppose we have no choice but to extend our havoc-wrrreaking.
7920 : Most respected Doctor Shantotto, would I be naive to assume you'll take rrresponsibility and clean up this mess before us?
7921 : My young inexperienced tactician, you're clearly not yet aware, of the true nature of this black mage beyond the pretty face and perfectly groomed hair.
7922 : Minister, an additional enemy unit approaches!
7923 : Uwaaah!
7924 : Ohohohohoho! You can hurl those all you like! But there is not a bleeding chance this Taru you will strike!
7925 : I thank you, Professor.
7926 : Before I deign to roll up my sleeves one thing must be made clear. For every time I save your hide a debt is incurred, you hear?
7927 : ...All units, the withdrawal command is canceled!
7928 : We hold our position for a while longerrr!
7929 : Hmm, I'm also of the opinion that we should continue fighting.
7930 : A too-early retreat may backfirrre and instead boost the enemy's morale--a scenario we want to steer clearrr of.
7931 : A unanimous decision, arrived at impressively fast.
7932 : Leonian War Warlocks, assume formation and prepare to cast!
7933 : Discharge!!!
7934 : Ohohohohoho!  Double, double, toil and trouble! Gigas burn, and Quadav shrivel!
7935 : ...Romaa!
7936 : Inside the fort where we convened is the entrrrance to a mineshaft that continues north for two malms beyond this chasm.
7937 : I remember seeing the entrance, but are you cerrrtain it's still accessible? It looked rather decrrrepit to me.
7938 : I confirrrmed it with my own eyes prior to the operation. There is always a small chance of cave-in, but the support beams are still securrrely in place.
7939 : Here is our problem. The enemy, too, has become aware of the mineshaft and its potential use.
7940 : They have begun evacuating their belfries as well as their rrremaining troops there.
7941 : If they are permitted to regroup, the tables will be turned against us. I need your unit to prrrevent that from happening.
7942 : Underrrstood.
7943 : And %, I have a favorrr to ask of you.
7944 : Take this % with you to the mineshaft entrance.
7945 : I want you to set it off just before you enterrr.
7946 : The sound will be the signal for the rest of us to move in.
7947 : Should the firecracker misfire for any rrreason, stay calm. Mham Lahrih nearby will supply you with a sparrre.
7948 : Anything else we need to know?
7949 : That is all. I'm counting on you.
7950 : You're counting on the right person! Come on, girrrls, %. We're going to flush some beastman scum out of the mineshaft!
7951 : Hey, you must be %. Lehko's told me about the strrrategy.
7952 : Here's a spare %. Now, go and show them Gigas a trrrick or two!
7953 : What is it? The battle's rrraging, so if you don't want to take a stray arrow where the sun don't shine, stay on your toes.
7954 : What did you hope to achieve with a stylishly late entrance? The enemy have long disappeared with the exception of a few remnants!
7955 : We've been working hard behind the scenes, Doctor.
7956 : The Cobra Unit played a most vital role, thwarrrting the enemy's attempt to regroup.
7957 : Ohoho. The Cobra's fangs struck swift and deep, of that I'm well aware. And so I offer my heartfelt praise. After all, it's only fair.
7958 : Hehehe.
7959 : Well done, Cobras. With your tireless effort and unwavering courrrage, we have successfully beaten the beastman force back in confusion.
7960 : But, there is not yet time to rrrevel in this victory. Given enough time, the enemy are certain to return in force.
7961 : Those who are able to walk, assist the wounded. Our prrriority now is to vacate this battlefield.
7962 : We return to Windurst!
7963 : Doctor Shantotto, if you could excuse my indiscretion, what are your plans hence?
7964 : Having witnessed you in battle this day, I have come to the conclusion that the rrrumors of your power sorely fail to do you justice.
7965 : Your presence at the capital would be equivalent to a thousand soldierrrs.
7966 : Is this not the perrrfect occasion for you to finally return to Windurst? You needn't be concerned with the Warlock Warlord--no one is in a better position than I to perrrsuade him.
7967 : Are you truly a military strategist, or here just for a lark? Your estimate of a thousand soldiers is a whole digit below the mark!
7968 : You, Professor, are confidence incarrrnate...
7969 : Gracious is your offer, but I fear I must defer.
7970 : That is most unfortunate...
7971 : There are still unsettled matters to which I must attend. For the foreseeable future, to others my time I cannot lend.
7972 : Besides, I have utter confidence that the capital will not come to harm. So long as it remains in the steadfast embrace of the Warlock Warlord's stumpy arms.
7973 : ...!
7974 : And you, sir, your charisma and prowess as commander leaves nothing to be desired. Your decisiveness in sending troops to their deaths would be, by many, admired.
7975 : ...
7976 : But you should know I have the honor of being one of the few, who are resistant--immune, even--to your charms and warped point of view.
7977 : I'm genuinely sorry to hearrr that...
7978 : Forgive me, ladies, for keeping you waiting. Let us now depart.
7979 : Do pass on my sincerest regards, my best wishes to the man in charge.
7980 : ...
7981 : Not even with a single head of wild onion, I'd trust the Warlock Warlord and his feline companion.
7982 : But, Minister, you were praising them so lavishly but a moment ago...
7983 : Well-meaning but thickheaded... Moreover, spineless and chicken-hearted...
7984 : I-I beg your pardon, Minister...
7985 : Doron-Fulun, you flatter yourself--the person to whom I refer...
7986 : Is the Warlock Warlord I had known in youth, the Robel-Akbel I remember!
7987 : Huh...?
7988 : I already told you, we brrrought the professor here from Windurst on official rrresearch business...
7989 : The Duchy of Jeuno, ruled by Archduke Kam'lanaut, lies beyond this point.
7990 : I have orders to prevent entry to any unauthorized travelers. Do you have any papers that document this official business?
7991 : Oh, you tig-taggily-tagged along, did you? It looks like you're just in time to joinify us for the return trip-aroo...
7992 : You, there. That's far enough. You must possess the proper identification before being permitted entry into Jeuno.
7993 : Excuse me, coming through... Ah, I thought so! Professor Koru-Moru!
7994 : Y-you...you're Rasusu!? (She's as bing-bangingly-beautiful as an angel-areeno...)
7995 : I figured from your letter that you'd be arriving sooner rather-wather than later.
7996 : And here I am! I would traversify a thousand times the diddly-distance to make your acquaintance...
7997 : This esteem-weemed personage is Professor Koru-Moru of the Windurst Aurastery, and an honored guest of our research effortaru.
7998 : I apologize for the harsh treatment, Professor. Welcome to Jeuno.
7999 : Yes, welcome, welcome! I'm so glad to see you've arrived safely-wafely.
8000 : And you were the professor's escort party? A job well done. I am Professor Koru-Moru's...
8001 : G-girlfrie--
8002 : ...colleague, Rasusu. Nice to meet you!
8003 : ...
8004 : Happy to help!
8005 : I mustaru introduce you to the rest of the research team! Come along, Professor.
8006 : This is where we partify ways. Keep your ting-tangily-tails out of mischief!
8007 : Sir, yes s--er...Professor!
8008 : That was...uneventful. I think I'm suited to a rrriskier style of mission.
8009 : You know, storm the enemy base, stealth and assassination, that sort of thing... The fun stuff that the mercenary majors get to do.
8010 : Something you can sink your claws into!
8011 : How did it go again? You wanted to impress the prince of a foreign nation with your dazzling swordplay, enter into a forbidden rrromance, then become a wealthy princess, rrright...?
8012 : What...what about it!? A girl can drrream, can't she!?
8013 : Oh, I say, can anyone help me!? Anyone at all!?
8014 : ...?
8015 : Would you look at that! You don't see that kind of prrretty down south!
8016 : Mihl! %! We've got to help him!
8017 : Are you serrrious?
8018 : Oh, I say, jolly good show. I was about to become afternoon tea for that beast. And what fortune to be rescued by such enchanting maidens.
8019 : Hehe. You rrreally should be more careful out here in the wilds, you know!
8020 : Tihl... One handsome face and we've lost her...
8021 : Speaking of which, what brrrings you out here all alone in the first place?
8022 : I am actually part of a San d'Orian reconnaissance party. Was. Am. Er...
8023 : Ahem. To cut a long story short, we acquired one of those Yagudo % and the feathered fiends were none too pleased...
8024 : They chased us down, and in the ensuing chaos I was separated from my unit and had the quipus stripped from me. I then had the misfortune to come across that creature...
8025 : A trrragic tale...
8026 : A quipus may contain vital information on troop movements and the like, and we were on our way back to San d'Oria to have it deciphered.
8027 : If...if you don't mind, we'd be happy to help you get it back.
8028 : Oh, I say, that's jolly decent of you!
8029 : Er, Tihl, shouldn't we be getting back to Fort Karugo-Narugo...?
8030 : How can you say that!? Do you mean to leave this delectable--er, distrrressed soldier to the whims of fate!?
8031 : (Weren't you listening? We might be able to uncover some important Yagudo military secrrret...)
8032 : (My instincts are telling me we're on to something big.)
8033 : (And if this information is as important as I think it is, we could be looking at instant prrromotion to mercenary captains!)
8034 : (Rrreally? We won't just have our hides skinned by the boss for defying orders?)
8035 : <Cough, cough>. Assuming we manage to salvage this quipus of yours, would you be willing to share the deciphered information?
8036 : We certainly share your patrrriotic spirit, and want to assist the war effort in any way we can...
8037 : Of a certain! There is no reason why this information should not be disclosed to our courageous allies. Your generous and noble words have impressed and captivated me, fair lady!
8038 : Oh, stop now...
8039 : Ahem. Well then, time to get to work! Mihl, %, let's split up and find this %!
8040 : We rrrendezvous here at this gate!
8041 : Oh, I say, you found it! Jolly good!
8042 : Grrreat work, %!
8043 : My thanks--to all of you! I am overcome by Windurst's compassion.
8044 : Time to head to San d'Oria! Um...how exactly do we decipher this thing, anyway?
8045 : A simple matter. I am acquainted with a friar who has a contract with a beastman interpreter.
8046 : I plan to have this interpreter unlock the mysteries of the quipus's knots.
8047 : An interprrreter, huh...?
8048 : Is our merry band ready to go? This way to the Kingdom of the Red Lion!
8049 : Now's not the time for catnapping. Let's split up and find that %!
8050 : We rrrendezvous here at this gate!
8051 : I am acquainted with a friar who has a contract with a beastman interpreter.
8052 : I plan to have this interpreter unlock the mysteries of this %.
8053 : Is our merry band ready to go? This way to the Kingdom of the Red Lion!
8054 : What the hell are you looking at?
8055 : I don't have time to entertain the likes of you. Get out of my face.
8056 : So you're from [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. What is that to me? I have no interest in your battles. I go where I want, when I want. No one can take that from me. Not you, not some [king/president/sibyl], not anyone.
8057 : Hold on... You haven't happened to hear anything about an Ensetsu, have you? His family's supposed to be living somewhere in Bastok.
8058 : Ah, never mind. Forget you heard anything from me.
8059 : What the hell is this? Do I look like a goldsmith? Get that thing out of my face!
8060 : Hah! You think you can buy my loyalty with a single throwing star!?
8061 : Hmph... I might consider helping out [your kingdom/your republic/your federation], but I won't be making you any guarantees.
8062 : As you can see, I still have many malms to tread before my training is complete. Perhaps one day our paths will cross again on the fields of battle. Until then, friend.
8063 : You say you are a representative of the [Kingdom of San d'Oria/Republic of Bastok/Federation of Windurst]...? Perhaps it is time I put my training to the test...
8064 : What is a lone Galka doing in a place like this? You are not that perceptive, are you?
8065 : Well met.
8066 : One point to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].
8067 : Two points to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].
8068 : Lysander! This is a key location in Jeuno's defenses. Don't think you can take it easy when I'm not looking over your shoulder!
8069 : Heh, why don't you go ahead and chase all those beastmen off for me, then?
8070 : Hah! You make it sound a simple task! These are the fiends that bathed Windurst in blood, and crushed the Royal Knights of San d'Oria!
8071 : Don't whimper like a little girl, Carlisle!
8072 : I have faith in your amazing luck on the battlefield!
8073 : Captain Lysander! Look! Another of those monstrosities...!
8074 : So, we have a maw in [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign] now, too...
8075 : How many of these things do we have confirmed?
8076 : Well, sir, there's one in [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign], one in [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign], and now this one in [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign]...
8077 : Alystair. Aren't you forgetting the reports from our allies?
8078 : Ah, you're quite correct, sir!
8079 : Including the three Jeuno has confirmed, there have been nine maws discovered in total, sir.
8080 : Hahaha. You needn't be so formal, son. This isn't the parade ground.
8081 : Still, that's not a small amount, even if they are spread over two continents...
8082 : Could it be the arrival of the Harbinger...?
8083 : You speak of the prophecy, sir?
8084 : Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but something feels wrong to me...
8085 : Rumors in Bastok say these maws are monsters set loose by the beastmen...or maybe even the Kindred.
8086 : They say the same in Windurst.
8087 : We are at war. It's natural for people to jump to conclusions.
8088 : But the truth is, we still have no facts either way.
8089 : We do know these things appeared right at a time when the beastman forces suddenly grew in size. That can't be a coincidence.
8090 : It's certainly worth looking into...
8091 : Is that...a person!?
8092 : This place wouldn't be my first choice for naptime...
8093 : Uh...!
8094 : You're not a Jeunoan soldier... State your name and regiment!
8095 : At ease, Corporal. I don't think [he/she] bites.
8096 : What happened, [man/ma'am]? Did you hit your head, or something?
8097 : Altana only knows what you were doing out here, but you better head to the safety of town.
8098 : Sergeant Barnabas. Civilian entrance to Jeuno is currently restricted...
8099 : Ah, that's right! Then you'll have to settle for the Eldieme Necropolis instead. If you walk straight south of here, you should come across an entrance into one of the more habitable areas.
8100 : Ah, that's right! Then you'll have to settle for the Crawlers' Nest instead. If you walk south of here, you should find the tunnel leading inside.
8101 : Ah, that's right! If you walk straight south of here, you should come across the base the Royal Knights are constructing. What was that fancy Elvaan name for it? Garl--?
8102 : Sergeant!
8103 : Well, be careful wandering around [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign] in any case. It isn't safe.
8104 : It's been converted into a base for allied operations, so it should be a far sight safer than sleeping out here in the wild.
8105 : On your way, civilian.
8106 : Should we return to Jeuno and report, Captain?
8107 : Yes. Archduke Kam'lanaut must be informed of the existence of this new maw.
8108 : GraAaAaaaAAgh!
8109 : % is engulfed by the cavernous maw!
8110 : A disembodied metallic voice drifts towards you...
8111 : You sense the gaze of the cavernous maw upon you.
8112 : When the Harbinger cometh...
8113 : The Champions of the Dawn shall descend...
8114 : Hm? Was that descend or fall...?
8115 : I can never remember the words...
8116 : Well, whatever, whatever. I have more important things to...
8117 : Oh! Oh my stars! This did not happen. Didn't happen.
8118 : How could I have been so blind? I never even noticed someone was here with me. Never noticed.
8119 : Oh, woe is me... I have fallen to the deepest blue depths of depression. Do you see how blue I have become?
8120 : Do you see how blue? Oh yes, completely blue. You seem black and white to me...
8121 : Of course you do! You are a child of Altana, after all!
8122 : But...I thought a child of Altana would sympathize! Be sympathetic, you know?
8123 : Oh!? What's this, what's this!?
8124 : Who knew such a thing was possible!?
8125 : What does this mean? What indeed?
8126 : Could it be? Could it be you possess the same power...?
8127 : The same power as me?
8128 : My whiskers are twitching. They twitch.
8129 : Shall I tell you what this means? Inform you? You possess the power to bend time itself. An ability bestowed only on the worthy.
8130 : Although, it seems you lack the same control that I have.
8131 : Uncontrolled, I would say.
8132 : But this is good news, nonetheless.
8133 : The regal feline peers intently at %.
8134 : My intent, you see, is to help end this war before certain terrible, indelible wounds are gouged into history.
8135 : Despite my best efforts, the nation of Elvaan knights devises pretentious plans that see them fall to the beastmen, time and again.
8136 : The Humes ignore the unrest in their city, while Galkan rage reaches boiling point. The point of boiling!
8137 : The Mithra squabble amongst themselves, and the Tarutaru dither as the Yagudo sack the city of Windurst. Sacking the city, they are!
8138 : To confound matters, the alliance between the nations of Altana is still in its infancy, and old suspicions threaten to sever the tentative bonds. Bonds could be severed!
8139 : There are only so many things I can do with these two small paws.
8140 : ...
8141 : Will you help me with this grand plan of salvation?
8142 : If things are allowed to run their course, this war will spread to consume Vana'diel in a tidal wave of tragedy.
8143 : I hope to shrink this tidal wave of tears, if only by a little. By a few drops.
8144 : It will be difficult, thankless work. Thankless and difficult. But would you be up to the task?
8145 : Are you up to the task? I'll do it! It's not my time...
8146 : I'm sorry, I seem to have misheard you! Heard something amiss!
8147 : I'll just ask you again, shall I? Are you up to the task?
8148 : Wonderful! I feel my depression lifting already.
8149 : The fate of this age rests on your shoulders! So much rests on you!
8150 : Ah, I forgot to mention the Champions of the Dawn.
8151 : It is prophesized that the Champions of the Dawn will appear in an age of strife and save the world from catastrophe.
8152 : A band of heroes? A bevy of maidens? Who knows? Is this the age the prophecy foretells?
8153 : I shall go forth and search for these champions with my mystical whiskers!
8154 : So very busy! Busy indeed...
8155 : Hm? An introduction? Have we not been introduced?
8156 : My name is Cait Sith.
8157 : I am certain we shall meet again in the near future. Or would that be the near past?
8158 : In any case, I wish you luck with your endeavors!
8159 : Luck to you!
8160 : DEBUG: Press the confirm button to continue.
8162 : Commencing intel extraction.
8163 : Gathering intel
8164 : Gathering intel
8165 : Investigation complete!
8166 : You are too far away from the target.
8167 : You have already gathered intel at this location.
8168 : The stronghold has sustained considerable damage.
8169 : Your work at this location is complete.
8170 : Something tells you you should wait a little longer before inspecting this location.
8171 : You are unable to gather intel while under the effect of Sneak.
8172 : You have acquired intel on the enemy's supplies.
8173 : You have acquired intel on the enemy's defense structures.
8174 : You have acquired intel on the enemy's weapon stores.
8175 : Surveillance of this location is complete.
8176 : The gathered information is insufficient. More surveillance is required.
8177 : Adequate intel has been acquired.
8178 : Sufficient surveillance has already been carried out.
8179 : The Frost Bomb uses Hypothermal Combustion. The Fortification takes # [point/points] of damage.
8180 : The bombardment failed to inflict damage on the target.
8181 : You have acquired sufficient intel on the peculiar device.
8182 : These are the supplies you are to deliver to the stronghold in this area.
8183 : The supply unit carrying rations and munitions to our stronghold in this area was attacked en route, and forced to abandon the cargo. You are to locate the supplies and deliver them to their final destination.
8184 : Some of the items are raw and will spoil if not delivered immediately. You must hurry.
8185 : Some of the items are very delicate and will be destroyed if you are not careful. Avoid all confrontation with the enemy.
8186 : Now move out.
8187 : What are you waiting for, %!? Move out!
8188 : This is an Allied Checkpoint Garrison.
8189 : You have located the missing supplies!
8190 : Good work, %. You have done a great service for your nation.
8191 : What is this!? These supplies are in terrible condition! I'll have to request headquarters for another shipment...
8192 : Alright, %. The reinforcements are ready to be escorted to the stronghold in this area.
8193 : Welcome, %. The troops you are to guide to the stronghold haven't arrived yet. Please wait a little longer.
8194 : Come on! Come on! How long is this going to take!?
8195 : You're all slower than turtles in the mud! I've had enough!
8196 : Are we there yet!? Where in Altana's name is the stronghold!?
8197 : Are you ordering me to return to ranks? Eh, I guess I have no choice...
8198 : It's about time!
8199 : Don't you think some of us should have stayed at the checkpoint? What if the beastmen attack?
8200 : I'm worried about the soldiers back at the garrison. I have to see if they are all right!
8201 : Erm... But what about the soldiers at the stronghold? Maybe they're being attacked, too? Oh, what should I do?
8202 : Understood, [sir/ma'am]. I guess the garrison will be alright...
8203 : We're finally here... I sure hope nothing happened at the checkpoint...
8204 : Where's the enemy? I'll take out a whole battalion with one hand tied behind my back!
8205 : Huh!? Was that an enemy scout!?
8206 : Uh... Does anyone have a map?
8207 : Oh, the stronghold's this way? Thanks!
8208 : So this is my new station. Doesn't look too bad.
8209 : Welcome, %.
8210 : You have # more [minute/minutes] (Earth time) to complete this mission.
8211 : The reinforcements have lost their way...
8212 : About time you showed up, soldier. This here's the shipment of materials you'll be transporting.
8213 : I suspect you've already been briefed, but this is some volatile, dangerous stuff. But you signed up for this mission, so we're counting on you to deliver it to the stronghold before its power dissipates.
8214 : You'd best deliver that to the stronghold while it still packs some oomph.
8215 : What's this? Whatever power was in this is long gone. No, this won't do at all.
8216 : Ahhh, so you're military tactician who who drew up the plans for this latest supply mission. Why don't we ask one of the men how its going, shall we?
8217 : You are the tactician responsible for our latest operation? Then I shall report in on the status of our mission up until now.
8218 : As per orders, the supply caravan completed preparation of our cargo last night, and set out on the designated route at daybreak.
8219 : Unfortunately, we encountered an accident and lost a portion of our cargo.
8220 : Most regrettably, we encountered an accident and lost out entire load of cargo.
8221 : We encountered considerable beastman opposition. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
8222 : We encountered a superior beastman assault force. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
8223 : We encountered a beastman supply convoy, who was also made immediately aware of our presence. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
8224 : We encountered a substantial force under the direct command of a beastman general. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
8225 : By the good graces of the Goddess, our convoy was able to emerge victorious over our adversaries.
8226 : By the good graces of the Goddess, our convoy was able to obliterate the beastman supply contingent. In addition, we seized a significant portion of the enemy's supplies.
8227 : However, despite our best efforts, our convoy was utterly defeated. All of our cargo was lost to the enemy horde.
8228 : By the good graces of the Goddess, we narrowly succeeded in throwing the beastmen ranks into chaos and disarray.
8229 : By the good graces of the Goddess, we somehow staved off the beastman attack and shook free. However, we were forced to abandon a portion of our cargo in the process.
8230 : However, we were unable to repel the beastman's relentless pursuit, and in the end our convoy was scattered. All of our cargo was lost to the enemy horde.
8231 : I am pleased to report that our unit was able to reach this stronghold safely with all of the intended cargo. The success of our mission was due in no small part to your brilliant planning.
8232 : Our unit was able to reach this stronghold safely with the cargo. Your planning may well have been the decisive factor in the success of our mission.
8233 : Our unit was able to reach this stronghold, though we did so bearing a great deal less than the intended cargo.
8234 : Supplies abandoned by the Beastmen can be seen be strewn about. However, there is nothing that could be put to any use.
8235 : The sandworm swallows you whole!
8236 : %...? Is it really you?
8237 : %! It's you!
8238 : Is that you over there, %?
8239 : Do my eyes deceive me? %! It truly is you, isn't it?
8240 : %? Hey, it's really you!
8241 : Is that you, %? Hey, over here!
8242 : Hey, is that you, %!?
8243 : %!? Hey, wait!
8244 : Oh, is that you, %?
8245 : %! Over here!
8246 : Do my eyes deceive me? %! It truly is you, isn't it?
8247 : Well, well, if it isn't %.
8248 : It's good to finally run into someone I know.
8249 : Thank Goddess I found you!
8250 : You certainly have a knack for showing up at the best of times.
8251 : I am so relieved to see you here!
8252 : I'm so happy to find you here!
8253 : Man, I thought I'd never find a familiar face!
8254 : Fancy seeing you here! Looks like the mirror has worked its magic again.
8255 : Boy am I glad to see you here!
8256 : You showed up at a good time, %. I could do with some help.
8257 : I'm so glad to see you, %! I was getting really lonely here...
8258 : I am so relieved to see you here!
8259 : Judging from the stupid grin on your face, you're not new to this place. Care to lend a hand?
8260 : I was examining one of those cavernous maws, but I've managed to somehow wonder into this strange place.
8261 : I don't know what happened. One moment I was checking out one of them ugly mega-mouthed maws, the next, I find myself here in this weird place.
8262 : I must have accidentally found my way here when I was examining those statues called cavernous maws.
8263 : My curiosity had gotten the better of me, and I decided to come see these statues they call cavernous maws with my own eyes. But alas, before I could comprehend what was happening, the ghastly statue swallowed me up into this strange realm.
8264 : I was just taking a look at one of them ugly maws, when it suddenly sucked me into this weird place.
8265 : I was just minding my own business, when--well, not exactly. I was getting a close look at one of those cavernous maw things, when it suddenly swallowed me whole!
8266 : I was taking a look at one of those cavernous maws, when I suddenly find myself here.
8267 : I don't know what happened. One moment I was checking out one of them hideous maws, the next, I find myself here in this weird place.
8268 : I was examining one of those cavernous maws, when the unsightly thing opens its gaping mouth and swallows me up. Then I wake up to find myself in this strange place.
8269 : I was trying to get a closer look at one of those ugly statues, but it must have been its lunchtime or something, because it suddenly decides to swallow me up. The next thing I know, I'm here in this weird place.
8270 : My curiosity had gotten the better of me, and I decided to come see these statues they call cavernous maws with my own eyes. But alas, before I could comprehend what was happening, the ghastly statue swallowed me up into this strange realm.
8271 : I was attempting to examine one of the cavernous maws, but the hideous statue had other ideas. It swallowed me whole and deposited me in this peculiar place.
8272 : I've been searching for a way back since.
8273 : I've been walking around in circles for almost a whole day now!
8274 : Try as I might, I haven't been able to find the way back. This place has got me licked.
8275 : I had all but given up hope of finding a way back, when you appeared.
8276 : I've been trying to find a way back for Goddess knows how long now... My feet are killing me...
8277 : I don't really know what happened, but I've been wandering here ever since, trying to find a familiar face. And then you show up! Destiny prevails yet again!
8278 : I was wandering around trying to find my way back, when you showed up, kiddo.
8279 : I've been trying to find a way back for Goddess knows how long now... I'm so glad that you're here, %!
8280 : I've been wondering around trying to find my way back for a good while now.
8281 : How are we supposed to get back, %? You know the way, right?
8282 : I had all but given up hope of finding a way out, when you appeared.
8283 : I've since been wondering around, trying to find a way back. That's my story. What's yours?
8284 : But now that you're here, I'm sure everything will be okay.
8285 : You've got to get me out of here, %!
8286 : You wouldn't happen to know how to leave this place, would you?
8287 : Would it be unreasonable to expect that you know the way back, %?
8288 : %, don't you know the way back?
8289 : But anyway, I think I've spent enough time here for one day. Can you take us back, %?
8290 : So, what do you think, %? Is there a way out of this place?
8291 : There's a way to go back, right %?
8292 : I'm stumped on this one, %. Any ideas on how to leave this place?
8293 : Please, %, I want out of here!
8294 : Would it be unreasonable to expect that you know the way out, %?
8295 : Actually, never mind your story. I'm more interested in finding a way back. Any bright ideas?
8296 : % holds the % aloft!
8297 : Well, that was kinda cool.
8298 : What the hell was that!?
8299 : What did you just do...?
8300 : What on Vana'diel just happened?
8301 : What happened?
8302 : Hey, what just happened?
8303 : Wh...What did you just do?
8304 : Hey, what happened!?
8305 : What did you just do?
8306 : Hey, what happened!?
8307 : What on Vana'diel just happened?
8308 : Care to tell me what just happened?
8309 : This place... We're finally back?
8310 : Hey, I know this place! We're back aren't we!?
8311 : Oh, never mind that. It looks like we managed to give that place the slip.
8312 : This familiar scenery... Why, we're back!
8313 : Hey, I know this place! We're back!
8314 : Hey, did we get back? We did, didn't we!?
8315 : This place... We're finally back!?
8316 : Hey, I know this place! We're back aren't we!?
8317 : This place... We're finally back?
8318 : Are we...really back? Yay! We're back, we're back!
8319 : This familiar scenery... Why, we're back!
8320 : Hm... We seem to have found our way out.
8321 : You're reliable as ever, %.
8322 : You did it, %! You got us out!
8323 : Thanks as always, %. You always seem to know what to do.
8324 : You've done it again, %! Thank you so much!
8325 : Thanks, %! You're a lifesaver!
8326 : You're incredible, %! I knew I could count on you!
8327 : Thanks, kiddo! You've gotten us out of a tight spot again!
8328 : You did it, %! You got us out!
8329 : You're ever the dependable adventurer, %. Thank you.
8330 : Woohoo! You're awesome, %!
8331 : You've done it again, %! Thank you so much!
8332 : It's good to be back. But we'll have to do something about that stupid grin of yours.
8333 : So these statues are gateways between our world and the beyond? I think I'll avoid dealing with these things from now on.
8334 : So these statues are like portals? That's kind of cool, but I've learned my lesson. I won't go near these crazy things again.
8335 : So these statues link our world with the beyond? It certainly wouldn't be cool to get lost in there again.
8336 : These statues are obviously gateways between our world and the realm beyond. Amateurs like myself would do well not to venture in alone, lest we are never heard from again.
8337 : So these statues, like, allow you to travel between our world and...whatever that place is? I'd better watch myself when I'm around them...
8338 : So these statues are like bridges between worlds? Sounds like fun times, but only if you know what you're doing.
8339 : These statues seem to be portals of some kind. They should really put up signs warning people not to get too close!
8340 : So these statues are like portals? That's kind of cool, but I've learned my lesson. I won't go near them again...
8341 : So these statues link our world with the realm beyond? You really have to watch yourself around these things...
8342 : So these statues are, like, doors to another world? After what I've just been through, I'm not sure I like them...
8343 : These statues are obviously gateways between our world and the realm beyond. Amateurs like myself would do well not to venture in alone, lest we are never heard from again.
8344 : These statues are obviously gateways to an alternate realm. One must be cautious when in proximity of such volatile objects.
8345 : But, it's a different story if you're around, %. You can call me whenever you're adventuring over on the other side.
8346 : Well, at least not on my own, anyway. It should be cool if you're around, %, so feel free to call me up whenever you're adventuring on the other side!
8347 : But that shouldn't be a problem if you're around, %. I'd be happy to adventure with you there anytime.
8348 : However, if an experienced traverser of realms like yourself were present, %, I would not hesitate to adventure there.
8349 : I'm not afraid when you're around, though, %. So call me whenever you decide to adventure inside there, okay?
8350 : I won't go in there on my own again. But if you do, I'd love to join you, %, so make sure you call me!
8351 : But little warning signs have never stopped you from venturing into dangerous places, %. My only choice then is to accompany you when you do go in there. Be sure to call me, you hear?
8352 : Well, at least not on my own, anyway. I'm not afraid if you're around, %, so feel free to call me up whenever you're adventuring on the other side!
8353 : I won't go in there on my own, but it's a different story if you're around, %. Call me when you get the urge to adventure over there, okay?
8354 : But as long as you're around, I'm not afraid of anything, %. I want you to call me whenever you decide to go back in there. It's a promise, okay?
8355 : However, if an experienced traverser of realms like yourself were present, %, I would not hesitate to adventure there.
8356 : You seem to have the means to traverse this portal at will, %. Call me if you need help in there.
8357 : I have to go now. See you later, %.
8358 : Well, I'm heading off now. Catch you later, %!
8359 : I'm heading off now. Take care, %.
8360 : I take my leave of you. Until next time, %.
8361 : I'm going now. Talk to you later, %!
8362 : Anyway, I'm heading back to my Mog House now. Catch you later, %!
8363 : I'm heading back now. Promise me you won't do anything reckless, alright?
8364 : Well, I'm off then! See you later, %!
8365 : We should get back before it starts raining. Be seeing you, %.
8366 : Thanks again for saving me, %. Bye bye!
8367 : I take my leave of you. Until next time, %.
8368 : I'm going now. Don't do anything stupid in my absence.
8369 : You can now summon your adventuring fellow to certain areas of past Vana'diel!
8370 : Good Goddess...
8371 : I've never seen such a large beastman force amassed in one place.
8372 : At a glance, the two sides look to be in a deadlock.
8373 : But we know better. The beastmen are simply biding their time, awaiting what they think an inevitable surrender.
8374 : The Jeunoan forces are clearly in a bad way.
8375 : %, let's hurry and deliver the letter to the archduke!
8376 : The Duchy of Jeuno, ruled by Archduke Kam'lanaut, lies beyond this point.
8377 : What business have you here under these forbidding circumstances?
8378 : Sir, I come bearing tidings from San d'Oria on behalf of Count Borel and Sir Ragelise of the Knights of the Ironcrest Hawk.
8379 : Lilisette is my name, and with me is my faithful retainer, %.
8380 : This here is the official letter, penned by the count himself.
8381 : Our sole endeavor is to ensure that a Jeunoan surrender does not come to pass.
8382 : Please, sir. It is imperative that we are granted an audience with Sir Nag'molada.
8383 : ...
8384 : Understood. Your concern for the Duchy's welfare is much appreciated.
8385 : This way, if you will.
8386 : How awful...
8387 : Sorry to have kept you waiting. I am Brandolf, Captain of the Ducal Guard.
8388 : Sir Nag'molada, I'm afraid, is presently afield on official business. It would be my honor to attend to you in his stead.
8389 : Thank you, Captain.
8390 : You've no doubt already seen with your own eyes the destruction that has befallen our once proud nation.
8391 : I fear the days when Jeuno could receive honored guests such as yourselves in all its glory have become a thing of the past.
8392 : Please rest assured, for we bring good tidings.
8393 : We present ourselves before you now having successfully secured a pledge of aid from the three nations.
8394 : Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria alike are making preparations to send reinforcements to Jeuno as we speak.
8395 : We beg you sir, relay this message to Sir Nag'molada and Archduke Kam'lanaut: Jeuno need no longer surrender!
8396 : Your dedication to the alliance is touching. Truly. However...
8397 : Captain?
8398 : The matter is long settled. The archduke...his mind will not be changed.
8399 : ...?
8400 : Jeuno's fate is sealed. Other nations need not suffer in the wake of its death throes.
8401 : But, why...?
8402 : It would be wise for you to leave now, while you're still able to do so of your own accord.
8403 : What on Vana'diel has gotten into you people!?
8404 : Why are you all so quick to lose hope!? So eager to throw down your arms!?
8405 : You misunderstand!
8406 : !?
8407 : We wished nothing more than to fight to the last man, unto our dying breath.
8408 : That it is both duty and honor to give one's life to protect our nation and all its citizens is the common conviction held sacred by all those in the Ducal Guard.
8409 : Then let us fight together!
8410 : Bastok, Windurst, San d'Oria, and Jeuno, side by side!
8411 : ...
8412 : Lilisette. %. Fighting is not the only way.
8413 : ...?
8414 : You have witnessed for yourself how this futile struggle has laid waste to Jeuno, the misery it has entailed upon soldiers and citizens both. Continuing to fight with the false hope that triumph will some day smile upon us will gain us naught but more death and devastation.
8415 : This vicious circle of heartache and suffering will spread across the land like a crippling disease, plunging all of Vana'diel into the blackest depths of despair. Even if nations were still to remain in the aftermath, they would be little more than fanciful names given to piles of rubble and ash.
8416 : Is such a wretched existence worth the sacrifice? Years from now, can we truly say and believe in our hearts that we've done right by our children, and theirs after them? Sir Nag'molada... He enlightened us so...
8417 : ...
8418 : Surrender does not mean defeat, nor does it spell the end. For as long as we shall live, so too will hope survive.
8419 : We must have patience, for the time will come again when the children of Altana will arise and reclaim what is rightfully ours.
8420 : Sir Nag'molada called the Ducal Guard to assembly and put forth these sentiments, with Archduke Kam'lanaut himself in audience. That is how the decision to surrender was made known to us.
8421 : We, the Ducal Guard, are sworn to protect and serve the archduke. His fate is our fate. Upholding his decisions, our duty.
8422 : B-but...
8423 : The reinforcements from the three nations are on their way here this very moment. Couldn't you at least put things on hold until they arrive?
8424 : It is too late. The archduke's decision...is final.
8425 : ...
8426 : Please understand. The thought of surrender pains us as it does you.
8427 : We knew that the archduke, his circle of advisors, and Sir Nag'molada had been deliberating the possibility.
8428 : But, truth be told, that the air of defeat could so swiftly envelop our nation's leaders gave us all pause...
8429 : Guests, have we?
8430 : ...!?
8431 : S-Sir Nag'molada... We were under the impression that you had left to deliver the news of surrender to the other nations.
8432 : I-I beg your pardon, Sir Nag'molada.
8433 : If my lord has overheard the conversation between Captain Brandolf and myself, could surrender not be delayed--
8434 : The surrender ceremony is about to commence.
8435 : It will be held deep underground, directly beneath Heavens Bridge.
8436 : They summon us to sign the instrument of surrender in what is little more than a hole in the ground. A final act of humiliation to sweeten their moment of triumph, no doubt.
8437 : Just the kind of petty thing those foul pigmen would derive pleasure from.
8438 : All personnel have been evacuated from the residential area as you commanded, sir.
8439 : Young lady. It would appear your efforts were in vain.
8440 : But be glad, for you now have the chance to bear witness to a truly historic moment--the death of a nation...
8441 : We couldn't stop them...
8442 : Jeuno is going to surrender...
8443 : %, what are we supposed to do now?
8444 : What should we do? Try to buy some time. When in Jeuno, do as the Jeunoans do.
8445 : Right! It's not over till it's over! We have to find a way to stall them until help arrives!
8446 : %! I can't believe I'm hearing this from you, of all people!
8447 : Think about it for a moment. Had the Crystal War been lost, and Vana'diel fallen under the rule of the Shadow Lord...
8448 : The two of us may never have been born! We'll fade away into nothingness...or however it works! Can you look me dead in the eye and say you want that to happen?
8449 : Now, the ceremony is supposed to take place underground. But where could the entrance be...?
8450 : My lady.
8451 : I understand you've suffered much on Jeuno's behalf, and wish to express my regret for the way things had to turn out.
8452 : It's far too early for apologies!
8453 : The two of us are going to head underground, to where the ceremony is to be held. There has to be something we can still do.
8454 : I see...
8455 : Up atop a defensive wall out in Batallia Downs is where you will find your entrance.
8456 : Take this key with you. You will need it to unlock the hatch.
8457 : Th-thank you!
8458 : Should you require a replacement, speak with Irwyn here and he will provide you with one.
8459 : Your courage and determination have rekindled the dwindling fire of my spirit.
8460 : Truth is, we of the Ducal Guard have been grudgingly biting our tongues all this time, suppressing the burning desire to keep on fighting.
8461 : That Jeunoan soldiers are mulishly stubborn and loath to admit defeat is no lie, it would seem. Hahahaha.
8462 : Heehee.
8463 : As you make your way underground, so too will we prepare for our final stand against the enemy.
8464 : And as for Captain Brandolf, I'm confident it won't take much to persuade him to see things our way.
8465 : Understood!
8466 : Lilisette. %.
8467 : The continued existence of Jeuno is at stake. We, the Ducal Guard, humbly beseech your help in our darkest hour.
8468 : You can count on us!
8469 : %, the only option left is for us to go underground and raise some hell.
8470 : It's just as well, though, 'cause keeping up the diplomatic charade was becoming rather tiresome. Heheheheheh...
8471 : The surrender ceremony is about to commence underground. Make haste before all is lost!
8472 : You've misplaced the %?
8473 : Sir Barnabas has briefed me on the situation. Here, take this spare %.
8474 : Come back with your lives, you hear?
8475 : There is no response. Perhaps you should try again later.
8476 : You have ventured too far from the field of battle. The Confrontation will automatically disengage if you do not return.
8477 : You have ventured too far from the field of battle. The Confrontation has been disengaged.
8478 : You have returned to the field of battle.
8479 : You have # [minute/minutes] (Earth time) to complete the battle.
8480 : You have # [minute/minutes] (Earth time) remaining to complete the battle.
8481 : You have only # [second/seconds] (Earth time) remaining.
8482 : Your time for this Confrontation is up...
8483 : The monster fades before your eyes, a look of disappointment on its face.
8484 : (Test message.)
8485 : Enter the garrison? Yes. No.
8486 : The % is ripped violently to pieces!
8487 : Greetings, fair traveler. My people would entreat thy assistance, and offer rich reward in return. Thou shouldst speak with my sister Callisto, who abides in Grauberg's Witchfire Glen.
8488 : Hark! Our foe lurks thither. How wouldst thou proceed?
8489 : How will you proceed? Withdraw. Charge in. Scout the enemy. Check weapon.
8490 : Our foe advances...may thine aim be true!
8491 : I have been observing our foe closely from my post. It appears that [it remains but a fledgling./its strength is on the wane./it has only begun to realize its true strength./its strength is burgeoning by the day./it has reached the pinnacle of its power.]
8492 : My sisters are monitoring the strength of our enemies throughout the realm. By your leave, I shall share with thee their findings.
8493 : East Ronfaure: [////] Jugner Forest: [////] Vunkerl Inlet: [////] Batallia Downs: [////]

8497 : The % thou hast entrusted to our keeping can endure only # more enchantments. Thenceforth, it shall be rendered useless. Pray be wary!
8498 : Greetings, traveler! How dost thou fare in thine adventures?
8499 : By my troth, what a thrilling battle! When thou landed the felling blow, a shiver ran down my wings! As promised, here is thy reward.
8500 : Dost thou find this enchantment to thy liking?
8501 : Accept the item? Accept. Refuse. (# times remaining)
8502 : Splendid! May it serve thee well.
8503 : % obtained %!
8504 : Ah, 'tis unfortunate. Sadly, my folk are not well-versed in the penchants of adventurers these days...
8505 : In that event, we shall prepare thy weapon to be enchanted anew. May thou be once more triumphant in battle anon!
8506 : What's this? 'Twould appear that thy weapon can endure no further enchantments.
8507 : Though it may fall short of thy expectations, pray accept it.
8508 : Otherwise, we shall have no choice but to dispose of it.
8509 : Many thanks for thine assistance!
8510 : Pray accept this % as but a humble token of our gratitude.
8514 : On the ground are the violently shredded remains of what appears to have been a label. Your instincts tell you that the perpetrator is no longer in the area.
8515 : On the ground are the violently shredded remains of what appears to have been a label. A chill runs up your spine as you feel a predatory gaze bear down upon you.
8516 : You are unable to activate the %, as not all party members currently have one in their possession.
8517 : It appears that using the % here will summon forth the enemy. (Your level will be restricted to #.)
8518 : Use the %? Yes. No.
8519 : Your enemy has found its prey elsewhere...
8520 : Your enemy has forsaken this area in search of better prey...
8521 : You sense that your enemy is lurking just out of reach, still wary from its most recent encounter. You will have to wait a while longer...
8522 : % obtained %!
8523 : Obtain this item?
8524 : Obtain this item? Take it. Leave it.

8530 : Hm? And you two are...?
8531 : Ah, come to partake in the Allied strategy meeting? You'd best hurry--all nations' representatives have long made their way to the Audience Chamber.
8532 : The joint operation headquarters has been established here in the Duchy under the auspices of Archduke Kam'lanaut.
8533 : As you all know, the Allied Forces of Altana have been amassing in Valdeaunia ahead of the looming battle.
8534 : For a blessing, the mysterious explosion at the Tavnazian Peninsula effectively annihilated half our enemy's numbers.
8535 : For a blessing, the enemy's campaign against Tavnazia has effectively halved their presence in Valdeaunia.
8536 : Even so, the Beastman Confederate force fortified in the Northlands is reported to exceed fifty thousand strong.
8537 : Commander Davilles has sent word regarding the situation at the Valdeaunian front...and the tidings are grim. Next to no ground has been made in the advance expedition against the beastmen.
8538 : The time is come for the Allied Forces to hurl its entire weight against the icy walls of Castle Zvahl and put an end to this impasse.
8539 : Captain Ragelise of the Knights of the Ironcrest Hawk! Step forth!
8540 : Sir!
8541 : You are hereby appointed commander of our Northern forces, with plenary authority over the siege of Castle Zvahl.
8542 : Pound out the details of the operation at the meeting to be held hence.
8543 : Sir! Yes, sir!
8544 : Without further ado, I shall explain the particulars of the operation.
8545 : Our forces shall be divided up by nation.
8546 : Upon arrival in Xarcabard, each nation is to take position at one of the three rally points indicated.
8547 : Pardon my premature interruption, but I fail to see the wisdom in spreading so thinly our limited manpower.
8548 : Then allow me to enlighten you. The three positions, you see, have been chosen by virtue of their distance to the enemy's route of passage, Castle Zvahl, and the subterranean cavern respectively.
8549 : ...Subterranean cavern?
8550 : 'Tis known that beneath Xarcabard lies a network of caverns that stretches to the bowels of Castle Zvahl.
8551 : By commencing our offensive in concert, we can engineer the enemy's retreat into the caverns...
8552 : And, ultimately, the castle itself.
8553 : Hrmmm...
8554 : Chief Sturm. Have you the requested item?
8555 : Naturally! Captain Bartholomaus himself relayed the specifics of your order to me!
8556 : At my behest, our Bastokan allies have furnished us with a batch of custom explosives.
8557 : Upon the confirmation of the enemy's retreat into the castle, we shall detonate the explosives and induce a cave-in of said passage, severing all escape routes. Thence, the siege of Castle Zvahl shall commence in earnest.
8558 : I see...
8559 : That concludes the first half of the operation.
8560 : The second half begins with a frontal assault on Castle Zvahl--a diversion, to be sure.
8561 : While the enemy's eyes are fixed on their front gate, a strike force will steal its way to the castle's flank.
8562 : And thence, storm the keep and deal the killing blow.
8563 : ...
8564 : The strategy shall henceforth be known as Operation Snowstorm. Success rests upon all units involved moving and breathing as one body and mind.
8565 : A brilliantly concocted strategy...is what I would say had we sufficient troops to execute it.
8566 : My thoughts exactly. Why, it would be nothing short of a miracle if we weren't instead felled by the very same prey we seek to dispatch! Have the temperate climes of San d'Oria softened your grip on the harshness of reality?
8567 : Wh-what!? How dare you!
8568 : Legatus Maximilian, please. Pressed for time as we are, I beg you keep your comments constructive.
8569 : 'Tis quite all right, Master Caster.
8570 : I shan't deny that many a Kingdom strategy has been somewhat...unorthodox of late.
8571 : But pray bear with me for a moment longer. I promise that all doubts will be assuaged.
8572 : Enter!
8573 : And who might these men and women be...?
8574 : 'Twould be no exaggeration to call them the caulk that shall keep afloat the vessel that is Operation Snowstorm.
8575 : Sparsely manned as our main units are, they can ill afford to focus on aught but their assigned tasks. To allow us the flexibility to deal with the unforeseen, it was deemed that a flying column would best suit our needs.
8576 : The Hydra Corps is the unit's name. Its configuration has been optimized for adaptability to meet the ever-changing face of the battlefield.
8577 : Fascinating...
8578 : Great balls of Firaga! If it isn't Putori-Tutori! Justaru when I was wondering where you might be hiding, lo and behold, you've gone and joined the Hydra Corps!
8579 : Heheh. It's a long story, but in a nutshell I was duly invited to become a member-wember. As you know, spells have never been my forte, but here, my talentarus will get to see full use!
8580 : The Geminian War Warlocks, I leave under your astute leadership. Do try not to bumble-wumble, you hear?
8581 : Likewise to you, little brother!
8582 : In choosing the members for this elite unit, each individual's unique talents were given precedence over proficiency in warfare.
8583 : Well, this certainly explains the rumors that master craftsmen from across the Middle Lands had assembled to produce weapons of unequaled might.
8584 : Might I venture to assume that all apprehensions regarding manpower have now been addressed?
8585 : You assume correctly, Sir Ragelise. Please disregard my earlier display of effrontery.
8586 : (So this is the celebrated San d'Orian commander who has garnered such lavish praise.)
8587 : (He appears every ilm the shrewd tactician spoken of in rumors. I daresay, victory might yet be within grasp...)
8588 : 'Tis a steep and rocky path that lies before us, my friends. But so long as we stand united, there is no mountain we cannot crest.
8589 : Together, we shall restore peace to our lands!
8590 : As the final item in the agenda, allow me to introduce the two volunteers who will serve as messengers for the operation.
8591 : Thrilled to meet you all! I'm Lilisette, Troupe Mayakov's brightest star, and with me here is %, my trusty companion! Together, we form the unbeatable tag-team duo, Future Fabulous!
8592 : Erhm... <Blush>...
8593 : And, errr...on that note, the meeting is concluded. We shall next meet on the snow-clad fields of Valdeaunia. Ensure that your respective units' passage there is uneventful. May the Goddess smile upon us!
8594 : <Sigh>...
8595 : (Sir Ragelise has been straining himself ever since the dance performance.)
8596 : (The thought of Portia torments him still. He keeps his personal ordeals well hidden behind a mask, but to me it may as well be made of glass.)
8597 : Please keep heart, Sir Ragelise. Surely, we'll triumph over the beastmen...and then you and Portia will be reunited.
8598 : Your concern is touching, young lady, but my foremost priority is the operation's success. Private matters have no place on the battlefield, nor in my mind. As commander, I must abide no thought that might impair my judgment.
8599 : War is a fickle thing. Plan out every single detail though we might, no man can know how events will unfold.
8600 : How events will unfold...
8601 : Now then. Pray make ready to leave for Xarcabard at the earliest hour. May the Goddess watch over you.
8602 : %. Do you know what happened at the Battle of Xarcabard?
8603 : How events are supposed to have unfolded?
8604 : History tomes state that the Allied Forces triumphed despite overwhelming odds, securing victory in the conflict.
8605 : But with so much of history already altered and countless variables at play, I dare not place my trust in the words of a book. First-hand accounts, on the other hand...
8606 : %, what say you and I learn more about the campaign from someone who was directly involved?
8607 : The knowledge should prepare us better for what's to come.
8608 : Let's make a brief detour to present-day San d'Oria before we head to Xarcabard!
8609 : The survivors of Operation Snowstorm arrived but a moment ago. If you hurry you might still be able to join them.
8610 : Ah, %.
8611 : Thank Altana you're here. I could scarce draw breath in this stifling atmosphere.
8612 : Loath as I am to state the obvious...
8613 : Operation Snowstorm was a complete and utter failure.
8614 : Ragelise. If credence can be given to reports, you absented yourself from your post in favor of joining the strike force. Explain yourself this instant.
8615 : ...
8616 : Sir Ragelise ain't to blame! The fault's mine for bringin'--
8617 : Be silent! That fact is neither here nor there.
8618 : Ragelise. As one of the Kingdom's most experienced, you knew full well what acting on a whim was like to entail upon us.
8619 : I would not presume to cast all blame upon you.
8620 : Yet 'tis clear that in dealing with the unforeseen, our losses may have been curbed had the Ironcrest Hawks not been bereft of their commander.
8621 : One of the Kingdom's finest units is no more, and the damage incurred by our Windurstian and Bastokan allies, immeasurable.
8622 : How do you intend to take responsibility for this debacle? Nay, best assume the chance to do so won't even be begrudged you.
8623 : Pray give me another chance, sir. I ask for but one more chance to redeem myself.
8624 : This is unseemly, Ragelise.
8625 : General Cousseraux! Surely you, too, bore witness to that...thing!
8626 : As we stand, we've no hope of triumphing over the enemy! None whatsoever!
8627 : That vortex--the ominous cloud of black swirling above the skies of Castle Zvahl--I am certain of its connection to the beastmen.
8628 : We must gather all the intelligence we can and use it to lay the foundations of our next strategy. I beseech you, sir. I require but one more chance--
8629 : Ragelise! Cease this unseemly display this instant!
8630 : !!!
8631 : Only after defeat do you open your eyes to the enemy's might? All who are present--even those who lost their lives in vain--knew of this from the very beginning!
8632 : You take my meaning amiss, General! The enemy's true strength lies neither in numbers nor tactical prowess--
8633 : That's quite enough! How much must you compound your disgrace!?
8634 : Traitor.
8635 : ...!
8636 : Did you not hear the first time? Traitor, he said! Fools we were to have placed our trust in you...
8637 : Were it not for you, the Ironcrest Hawks would still...they'd still...
8638 : ......
8639 : Like it or not, this is the consensus. I counsel you to accept it should a knight's sense of honor survive within you still.
8640 : It pains me to do this, Ragelise, for you were one of our very best. You are hereby discharged from the order of the Royal Knights of San d'Oria, and by extension, the Allied Forces of Altana. Never again show your face before us.
8641 : No... This can't be happening...
8642 : Very well, sir. I had come prepared to accept the full scope of punishment for my actions.
8643 : But pray heed well my words of warning, General, for the terrain of war is no longer as it seems. The terms of conflict have changed beyond recognition.
8644 : ...
8645 : Ragelise! Come back!
8646 : I will appeal to the council... Their decision may yet be overturned!
8647 : Ragelise!!!
8648 : I would join milord, if it pleases him.
8649 : Ah, sweet lady. You are not unknowing of my fall from grace.
8650 : The road I have been set upon is fraught with hardship. No longer have I a place to call home. No place to lay a weary head.
8651 : Milord should already know my mind.
8652 : I would willingly follow you to the very ends of Vana'diel.
8653 : After all that has come to pass, those words from you are perhaps all I need.
8654 : The Allied Forces fight a hopeless battle.
8655 : But even should my allegiance be annulled, as a lone wolf, I shall fight on.
8656 : That otherworldly entity we encountered at Castle Zvahl... Whatever its true identity may be, we must seek it out.
8657 : More power... Only by acquiring more power shall my ambition be fulfilled.
8658 : Yes, milord.
8659 : Portia! Sir Ragelise! Waaait!
8660 : Goodbye, Lilisette...
8661 : ...
8662 : Waaait! You mustn't go! You...you can't!
8663 : What is it they intend to do? Return to Castle Zvahl?
8664 : We must follow them, %!
8665 : I, too, shall join you. Be in tow.
8666 : Cait Sith! For the love of the Goddess, where have you been all this time?
8667 : I went to see Atomos. Tried to dissuade it from further devouring time. But I fear it was to no avail. Mission failed.
8668 : Should Portia and Ringaling fall into the enemy's hands at this juncture, all would be lost! Up in smoke!
8669 : We give chase! Mustn't let them out of sight!
8670 : The % quivers ever so slightly, but emits no light. There seem to be no monsters in the area.
8671 : The % quivers ever so slightly and emits a faint light. There seem to be no monsters in the immediate vicinity.

8702 : Unless the situation takes a turn for the better, the brighter future shall forever be lost. Be given to the darkness.
8703 : It is the divine will of Altana that this evil does not befall the world. Must avert in the Goddess's name.
8704 : GraAaAaaaAAaaAgh...
8705 : As the one-winged bird...knows not the skies...
8706 : Incomplete...the Champions of the Dawn...can ill uphold...the will of Altana...
8707 : We know that all too well. Are painfully aware. That's why we've come here, to recover the Goddess's lost wing.
8708 : You deemed Lilisette's existence dispensable, and so disposed of her memories. Consumed them to the last orb.
8709 : But we need those memories restored. We want Lilisette back.
8710 : We implore you, Atomos, return the poor girl to us! Show pity!
8711 : The memories...of the young girl...Atomos indeed consumed...
8712 : So where is Lilisette now!? You must apprise us of her whereabouts! Reveal her location!
8713 : All memories...deemed dispensable...are deposited here...the Walk of Echoes...
8714 : Then here is where we should look? Conduct the search?
8715 : Given the Walk's vastness, this may prove to be a time-consuming task. Take a considerable while.
8716 : S-Spitewardens!
8717 : Found ya at long last.
8718 : Watch out! Take cover!
8719 : Bah.

8731 : %!
8732 : Were you able to procure the objects we sought? The items in question?
8733 : So...these are Lilisette's memories. Her very essence.
8734 : ...!
8735 : That blinding column of light Atomos just sent lancing down to the surface...
8736 : It appears to have fallen in the vicinity of Grauberg, if this regal feline's not mistaken. My eyes saw true.
8737 : Let's hasten there, %, and ascertain the nature of this phenomenon. Find out what's a-paw.
8738 : Hm? Oh, it's you.
8739 : I see you're without your companion today. No, wait. As I recall, you always traveled alone...but never mind that.
8740 : The Allied Forces continues its desperate struggle in the Northlands. Only the Knights of the Red Rose remain garrisoned here.
8741 : You are free to proceed should you have business with them.
8742 : Hm? You partook in Operation Snowstorm, did you not?
8743 : That such a promising strategy should fail so spectacularly was a grave disappointment to us all.
8744 : ...And to none more so than Sir Noillurie. Though she'll not admit to it, Sir Ragelise's dismissal came as a personal blow.
8745 : Yet the war rages on, concerning itself not with matters of the heart. 'Tis all we can do to stay focused on our objectives.
8746 : This is Chimene, over!
8747 : 'Tis I, Noillurie.
8748 : I require that a batch of martial rice balls be brought to Batallia Downs, posthaste.
8749 : They shall be delivered at once, sir!
8750 : Hmm... 'Tis highly uncharacteristic of the captain not to strike out amply supplied. Truly, the matter of Sir Ragelise must weigh heavily upon her mind.
8751 : We, the Knights of the Red Rose, never leave base without the rice balls, you see. 'Twould be no exaggeration to call them the beating heart of our rations.
8752 : The key ingredient--a specially prepared hot relish--puts a raging fire in one's belly, granting the resilience of a thousand thorned roses.
8753 : This recalls to my mind the time Captain Noillurie first sent for additional rice balls, earlier in the war. Upon my arrival at the encampment, however, she vehemently insisted she had made no such request.
8754 : She sent me back to base, but not before reprimanding me for my indiscretion with enough choice words to gag a goobbue. There'll not be a repeat of that episode, surely.
8755 : Now then, where did I put the relish?
8756 : Curses! Of all the times to be exhausted of our supply!
8757 : Loath as I am to ask this of you, we urgently require %.
8758 : In the Vunkerl Inlet there resides a Goblin named Leadavox. Bring her %, %, and %, and she will concoct the relish for you.
8759 : Do make all haste. I shall remain here to prepare the rice balls in the meantime.
8760 : I bear a message for you, from Chimene of the Knights of the Red Rose.
8761 : You are to make your way to the Vunkerl Inlet. Once there, seek the Goblin Leadavox and have her prepare %.
8762 : The following ingredients are required: %, %, and %.
8763 : Ah, I see you've procured the requested %. You may proceed.
8764 : The %! You have my gratitude!
8765 : A goodly batch of rice balls stands ready to soak up the fiery goodness of the relish.
8766 : A-ahem. Testing, testing.
8767 : Chimene, do you read?
8768 : Sir Noillurie! How might I serve you?
8769 : I require a batch of martial rice balls to be brought to Batallia Downs without delay.
8770 : They shall be delivered at once, sir!
8771 : Hehehehe... Just as I planned.
8772 : What? It was a girl named Lilisette, you claim, who requested the rice balls that first time?
8773 : Now that you mention it, the captain's voice did strike me as odd that day. Though such a thing isn't altogether unusual when communicating via linkpearl, to be sure.
8774 : Of this so-called Lilisette, however, I have no knowledge.
8775 : I would know more of this prankster, but I must needs attend my captain. By your leave...
8776 : Hm? Is there something else?
8777 : If you seek Chimene of the Knights of the Red Rose, she has struck for Batallia Downs.
8778 : You're here to attend the wedding of Sir Ragelise and Lady Portia?
8779 : In that case, I ask you to leave your arms in my care. Speak to me again once you have removed them from your person.
8780 : The ceremony will be held at the Temple of the Goddess, in Upper Jeuno. You had best hurry--it is due to commence momentarily.
8781 : The ceremony will be held at the Temple of the Goddess, in Upper Jeuno. You had best hurry--it is due to commence momentarily.
8782 : Please leave your arms with me before proceeding. Speak to me again once you have removed them from your person.
8783 : Hm? Oh, it's you.
8784 : You're %, Portia and Mister Mayakov's good friend, right?
8785 : The proceedings are about to commence! Hurry up already!
8786 : Will those in attendance kindly clear a pathway to the altar.
8787 : Dearly beloved. We are gathered here today to witness the joining of Sir Ragelise B Baloumat and Portia Fonteyn in holy matrimony.
8788 : Will the groom and the bride approach.
8789 : <Gasp>! Sh-she's absolutely stunning...
8790 : <Thigh>... I can thcarthe wait for the day I walk down the aithle, garbed like tho...
8791 : Wh-what!?
8792 : What'th with the thocked exthprethion? I meant the tuxthedo, thilly!
8793 : In time immemorial, the Goddess Altana wept tears of benevolence upon the land, and from those tears we were born.
8794 : Then the Goddess bade us to love one another.
8795 : It is our creed, and our mission, for only love can restore Vana'diel to her former beauty.
8796 : Today, these two before us have heard the Goddess's word in their hearts. They are brave, for this is the first step of a long journey.
8797 : Sir Ragelise. Do you take this woman as your sacred wife, to love for all eternity and never betray, even should your blade be sundered, and your quiver emptied?
8798 : On my honor, I do.
8799 : Portia. Do you take this man as your sacred husband, to love for all eternity and never betray, even should your blade be sundered, and your quiver emptied?
8800 : On my honor, I do.
8801 : Now, say unto one another the holy vows.
8802 : I will be Portia's sword. I will be at Portia's side, defending her from harm's edge, and repelling her foes, always.
8803 : I will be Sir Ragelise's dagger. I will be at Sir Ragelise's side, defending him from harm's edge, and repelling his foes, always.
8804 : By the power vested in me, I pronounce you man and wife. May the glory and fortunes of war be with you.
8805 : Now, go forth. Your journey lies before you.
8806 : Congratulations!
8807 : Ragelise, you old dog! Always had to be first in everything, you did. Don't you dare make Portia cry, elsewise you shall answer to me!
8808 : <Thob>... I'm thooo happy for the two of you.
8809 : N-never mind me... <Thniff> I have thomething in my eye, ith all.
8810 : The rethepthion will be held in the Ru'Lude Gardenth thortly. I will thee you there, %.
8811 : %!
8812 : We're so glad you could be with us on our special day!
8813 : If it weren't for you, Sir Ragelise and I might not have made it this far.
8814 : For a certainty.
8815 : Neither of us have memory of what transpired in Valdeaunia. Nor do we know how we came to be back in San d'Oria.
8816 : The only link we have to that blank in our recollection is a parchment we found by us upon awakening.
8817 : Upon it are scrawled simply the words: Be sure to thank % and Lilisette.
8818 : A mystery, to be sure, but it would seem we two owe you much and more than we can remember.
8819 : Another mystery being this Lilisette... Is this person known to you, perchance?
8820 : Lilisette... Is no longer with us. Gave me this earring.
8821 : Oh... Then I suppose there's no way to give her our thanks.
8822 : Hm?
8823 : Why, this earring is identical to mine! I never imagined I'd see another!
8824 : Hm?
8825 : By Altana...what's come over me?
8826 : <Sob>... What...what is this grief that racks me so--<sniff>--on the happiest day of my life?
8827 : P-please forgive me.
8828 : I know not what brought on the tears.
8829 : All of a sudden it felt as though there was a gaping hole in my heart...as if I've lost something terribly dear to me.
8830 : Why, if it ithn't %! Enjoying the fethtivitieth, I trutht!
8831 : The bouquet toth ith about to take plathe. Thouldn't you be among the bloodthirthty horde of eligible bacheloretteth vying for the honor?
8832 : The bouquet toth ith about to take plathe! I wonder who the lucky lath will be! Teehee!
8833 : Oh, my... Lovely beyond wordth...
8834 : Why, it'th ath if the Goddeth herthelf bletheth thith union with Her divine prethenthe.
8835 : Lilisette...
8836 : An enchanting name, brimming with warmth and hope.
8837 : Yet somehow...forlorn.
8838 : A beautiful name, my love.
8839 : It seems we're of a mind, milord.

8887 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
8888 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
8889 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
8890 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
8891 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
8892 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
8893 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
8894 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
8895 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
8896 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
8897 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
8898 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
8899 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
8900 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
8901 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
8902 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
8903 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
8904 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
8905 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
8906 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
8907 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
8908 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
8909 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
8910 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
8911 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
8912 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
8913 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
8914 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
8915 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
8916 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
8917 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
8918 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
8919 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
8920 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
8921 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
8922 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
8923 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
8924 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
8925 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
8926 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
8927 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
8928 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
8929 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
8930 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
8931 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
8932 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
8933 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%

8989 : Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.

8991 : Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
8992 : I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
8993 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Have stratum abyssite examined. Request teleportation. Analyze atmacite. Ask about atmacite. Ask about atmacite enrichment.

9008 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
9009 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
9010 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
9011 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
9012 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
9013 : The atmacite could not be purged...
9014 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
9015 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
9016 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
9017 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
9018 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
9019 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
9020 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
9021 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
9022 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
9023 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
9024 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
9025 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
9026 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
9027 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
9028 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
9029 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
9030 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
9031 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
9032 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
9033 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
9034 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
9035 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
9036 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
9037 : Your % has evolved into %!

9773 : I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the [Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana]. My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.
9774 : I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.
9775 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Ask a bunch of questions. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
9776 : While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess % may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
9777 : The % is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.
9778 : Enlisted in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s armed forces, you say? Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.
9779 : I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
9780 : While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel. Come back again once you have proven your worth.
9781 : You must be at least level # to participate in Voidwatch.
9782 : Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!
9783 : I see you've yet to be issued %. Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.
9784 : Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.
9785 : You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or jurisdiction.
9786 : Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.
9787 : While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with %.
9788 : Operations are presently underway at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
9789 : Operations are presently underway at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
9790 : Operations are presently underway at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
9791 : It would seem some other requirement exists besides the usual % and %.
9792 : Rest assured, you will be apprised of this information as soon as we acquire it.
9793 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].
9794 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg].
9795 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo].
9796 : When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension. The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.
9797 : Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!
9798 : Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.
9799 : The % you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.
9800 : You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
9801 : Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts. This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.
9802 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
9803 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
9804 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
9805 : Operations are currently underway [in the greater Jeuno region/in the three nations]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
9806 : Ah, I daresay your % has undergone change!
9807 : How many would you like? None. Just one. Fill me up!
9808 : Here is your additional % allocation. Make each and every one count, you hear?
9809 : It appears you already possess the maximum allocation of # stones. I'm not authorized to provision you with more.
9810 : I'm afraid we're out of stock. The next shipment is expected to arrive in # [minute/minutes] (Earth time).
9811 : Obtained key item: # %!
9812 : Obtained key item: # %!
9813 : Your outstanding allocation of %? My records tell me you have # to your name.
9814 : Exchange for what? (Cruor: #) Nothing right now. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #.
9815 : # cruor is required for %.
9816 : # cruor is required for the %.
9817 : Proceed? (Required Cruor: #) Yes. No.
9818 : It seems you do not have enough cruor.
9819 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for %!
9820 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for the %!
9821 : Hm? It seems you already possess %. In that case, you won't be needing another.
9822 : This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.
9823 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.
9824 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.
9825 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.
9826 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.
9827 : A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.
9828 : A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.
9829 : A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
9830 : What will you ask about? Nothing. The Voidwalker threat. How I can do my part. The Voidwatch. Voidwatchers. Ascent items. Riftworn pyxides. %. Stratum abyssite. Planar rifts. Cruor. Abyssite. Voidstone consumption.
9831 : Voidwalker is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.
9832 : Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.
9833 : While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.
9834 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.
9835 : As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.
9836 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.
9837 : To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.
9838 : Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.
9839 : Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.
9840 : Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought. Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.
9841 : These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team. They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.
9842 : Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.
9843 : The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to # stones per person at any given time.
9844 : That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.
9845 : The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call Voidwalkers.
9846 : Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.
9847 : Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.
9848 : Possession of % is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
9849 : It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.
9850 : You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.
9851 : Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
9852 : In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.
9853 : The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.
9854 : When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.
9855 : Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.
9856 : However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.
9857 : Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.
9858 : Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.
9859 : But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the existential spectrum.
9860 : You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned. In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.
9861 : The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.
9862 : To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.
9863 : Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
9864 : Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.
9865 : One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items, while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.
9866 : Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.
9867 : All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.
9868 : Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.
9869 : For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.
9870 : In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.
9871 : Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.
9872 : If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.
9873 : Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company. It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.
9874 : Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.
9875 : Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.
9876 : Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.
9877 : % and % are representative of such items. They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.
9878 : (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)
9879 : They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.
9880 : Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.
9881 : Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.
9882 : Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.
9883 : Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding. But I digress...
9884 : Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.
9885 : As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch. Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.
9886 : It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.
9887 : Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong. Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.
9888 : Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.
9889 : The % is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.
9890 : Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.
9891 : The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.
9892 : I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.
9893 : I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.
9894 : Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?
9895 : Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.
9896 : Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them. Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!
9897 : And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.
9898 : I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really. Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.
9899 : As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray. Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...
9900 : Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.
9901 : Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing. There exists another: stratum abyssite.
9902 : Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite. Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.
9903 : Are you familiar with voiddust? Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.
9904 : As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch. Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.
9905 : The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust. Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me? Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.
9906 : At any rate, should you manage to obtain any voiddust in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me. Simple enough, wouldn't you say?
9907 : Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
9908 : Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.
9909 : If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.
9910 : Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land. The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
9911 : By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension.
9912 : Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.
9913 : Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.
9914 : Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.
9915 : Keep this fact in mind at all times.
9916 : It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.
9917 : If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...
9918 : Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
9919 : While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.
9920 : As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants. There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.
9921 : Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.
9922 : Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite. If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.
9923 : As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.
9924 : Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.
9925 : Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called periapt--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
9926 : Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.
9927 : Select where voidstones will be consumed from.
9928 : Set to which? Key items. Stock.
9929 : Voidstones will now be taken from [your key items/the stock].
9930 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here is your voidstone! Take it and use it well.
9931 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here are your voidstones! Take them and use them well.
9932 : It seems you already possess as many voidstones as you can carry. You'll want to hold on to that voiddust until you've depleted your supply.
9933 : How many do you need? (Cruor: #) None, thank you. One (# cruor). Three (# cruor). Six (# cruor). Nine (# cruor). Twelve (# cruor).
9934 : % obtains one % in exchange for # cruor.
9935 : % obtains # % in exchange for # cruor.

9944 : At attention, soldier! I've received an urgent alarum calling our best men to arms, and guess whose name is listed front and center? You're to report to Jeuno for further orders immediately.
9945 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me. Pick up those legs and get a move on!
9946 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me.
9947 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate in Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through.
9948 : Time is short, so pick up those legs and get a move on, soldier!
9949 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate just over there and one of our men will see you through.
9950 : Excellent work, %. You serve the Voidwatch well. Your presence has been requested in the Grand Duchy once more. Make your way there with all speed.
9951 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace.
9952 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
9953 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate at Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
9954 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
9955 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate over there and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
9956 : Where's your %, soldier? I'll need to see one before I can authorize your participation in the [Jeuno/Qufim] Voidwatch jurisdiction.
9957 : % are issued only to those brave men and women who have distinguished themselves in regional Voidwatch efforts.
9958 : Prove yourself capable in the three nations, and you can rest assured that your abilities won't go overlooked. Keep fighting the good fight, soldier!
9959 : Reporting for combat, are you? Yes, this % of yours appears to be in order. Welcome aboard!
9960 : I suspect you've already been briefed about the use of %, but protocol dictates that I ask if you are in need of a review. What will it be, soldier?
9961 : What will it be, soldier? Ready for battle, sir! I need a briefing, sir!
9962 : Now that's what I like to hear, soldier!

9980 : Hold it right there, soldier! A summons just came in from the Grand Duchy, and it's got your name on it. The envoy said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you get moving.
9981 : We've been looking for you, soldier. I've got a summons from the Grand Duchy here, and just look at the name on it: %. Our messenger said it's an urgent matter, so I suggest you ready yourself and depart immediately.
9982 : You may also undertake this operation at Beaucedine Glacier.
9983 : How many? (Cruor: #)
9984 : You may purchase up to # at a time.
9985 : Only those with % are allowed to pass. Be on your way.
9986 : What's this? %? Ah, you must be one of the [adventurers/Allied soldiers] participating in the Voidwatch operation. Pray forgive my oversight.
9987 : If you could wait but one moment, I shall announce your arrival.
9988 : My apologies for the delay. You may proceed within.
9989 : Ah, you've come. I've heard much of your exploits. We are fortunate indeed to have you on our side.
9990 : No doubt you're wondering why I've summoned you here today.
9991 : Time is of the essence, so I'll get straight to the heart of the matter. We are engaged in an operation of the utmost importance, and I thought you'd be just the [man/woman] for the task.
9992 : As you may have already noticed, the Voidwalker threat grows more menacing by the day. In particular, the fiends we have encountered here in the vicinity of the Duchy are possessed of powers that dwarf their already-formidable brethren.
9993 : I hereby authorize you for participation in Voidwatch operations in the Jeuno region. Serve us well, and you will be duly compensated for your efforts.
9994 : You are not the only [adventurer/Allied soldier] I have recruited for this operation. Should you chance upon any others, you may join up with them if you so choose. The Duchy--no, the entire realm--is counting on you, %. Do not let us down.
9995 : So you have finally come. I am Mawl'gofaur, aide to the Archduke and overseer of the Voidwatch operation in His Excellency's absence.
9996 : I hear you have proven yourself capable on the field. The Grand Duchy has need of your services.
9997 : The Voidwalker threat grows ever more grave by the day. The fiends that have been sighted in the immediate vicinity of Jeuno, in particular, possess powers unlike anything we've seen before.
9998 : Were the Duchy to fall to this extradimensional menace, it would spell disaster for the realm. This should be evident to even a grunt such as yourself.
9999 : In the name of His Excellency Kam'lanaut, Archduke of Jeuno, I hereby authorize you for participation in all Voidwatch operations conducted under the Duchy's jurisdiction.
10000 : Mind you, you are not the only one to whom I have bestowed this clearance. Should you chance upon any of the others, you may band together against the fiends. Or do not. It matters little to me so long as you succeed in your efforts.
10001 : We lack for capable soldiers, so do try to stay alive. Now be off with you. More pressing matters require my attention.
10002 : The assignment of individual objectives will be handled by our officers stationed throughout the greater Jeuno region. Report to one posthaste to receive your orders.
10003 : Do not forget to report back to an officer upon completing an objective, lest your accomplishments go overlooked.
10004 : ...That is all. You are dismissed.
10005 : I remind you again...
10006 : Ah, you've returned! Your exploits in the Jeuno operation have been remarkable to observe. On behalf of the entire Grand Duchy, I commend you.
10007 : ...Very well. The next step is clear. I hereby authorize you to participate in our Qufim operation.
10008 : Again, I must warn you. The enemy you face in Qufim will be unlike anything you've faced thus far.
10009 : The Voidwalker menace grows more dire with each passing hour. Where do these beasts come from, and what brings them to our world? Sometimes it seems as if the tireless efforts of our researchers yield more questions than answers.
10010 : And yet we can do nothing but continue the fight. I'm counting on you, %.
10011 : On behalf of the Grand Duchy, I commend your efforts in the Jeuno Voidwatch operation. Yet the battle is far from won.
10012 : I hereby issue you your next assignment. You are to travel to the Qufim region and assist in our operation there.
10013 : The Voidwalker menace is at its most fierce in Qufim. We have already lost our share of capable men.
10014 : Do your best not to join them. Now be along on your way.
10015 : %! I've received word of your accomplishments in Qufim. Truly, your service to the Voidwatch has exceeded even my initial expectations.
10016 : %! I've received word of your accomplishments. Truly, your service to the Voidwatch has exceeded even my initial expectations.
10017 : And yet it is hardly the time to rejoice. You have seen it with your own eyes--no sooner is one fiend slain than another of its brethren emerges to take its place.
10018 : We must find a way to seal the planar rifts. Then, and only then, will we be able to quash this extradimensional menace once and for all.
10019 : Even as we speak, an elite team of my best researchers works tirelessly to that very end. Sadly, the true nature of the rifts remains very much an enigma...
10020 : And so I have no choice but to employ capable adventurers such as yourself to keep the fiends at bay. As inefficient as it may seem, it is the best course of action available to us under these conditions.
10021 : We are counting on your continued efforts, %. In the meantime, take this for your service. May it serve you well.
10022 : Admirable work in Qufim, soldier. I did not think you had it in you. His Excellency has expressed great satisfaction in your accomplishments as well.
10023 : And yet we cannot afford to become complacent. For each fiend we dispatch, a more abominable monstrosity rises to take its place.
10024 : We have recovered much useful data from your encounters with the Voidwalkers. Data that an elite team of our best researchers works tirelessly to analyze.
10025 : Yes, we must discover a means to seal the rifts once and for all. Then, and only then, will victory truly be ours.
10026 : Until that day, we have no choice but to continue the fight.
10027 : You have proven yourself a valuable ally to our cause.
10028 : The Archduke himself trusts you greatly. That is one trust that you would do well not to betray.
10029 : Take this for your efforts, and do not let up the fight. We will be watching you with great interest, %.
10030 : Pssst! %!
10031 : Over here! This way, I say! It's me! Cait Sith, your feline friend!
10032 : Do forgive me for my appearance. Pardon my unfamiliar manifestation.
10033 : You may think of it as sort of passing fancy. A cait's caprice.
10034 : But there are more important matters a-paw. Matters that would best be discussed somewhere other than here, I fear.
10035 : Let us rendezvous in the Pashhow Marshlands of the past. The age-old swamp. It's quite a trek, so take care and don't be late! Ta-ta, %!
10037 : Ah, there you are. No doubt you already know why I've summoned you here today.
10038 : Thanks to your efforts, our extradimensional intruders had remained silent for a spell...but no longer. We've just received word that new planar rifts have been identified.
10039 : Three locations, all told: Vunkerl Inlet, Grauberg, and Fort Karugo-Narugo. I would have you investigate further.
10040 : We are aware that you are on active duty for the Allied Forces. As such, you may prioritize your Voidwatch efforts as you see fit.
10041 : At any rate, we will issue you a badge of authorization. Present it to our men afield to receive further orders.
10042 : You are not the only Allied soldier who has been recruited to the Voidwatch cause. There is strength in numbers, so you would do well to seek them out. The Duchy awaits word of your success, %.
10043 : Impressive work on the Voidwatch front, %. Once again, you prove yourself an invaluable asset to the cause.
10044 : The war with the Beastman Confederate has taken its toll upon us all. Allied soldiers struggle merely to stay on their feet.
10045 : And yet, in such trying times, brave [men/women] like yourself have answered our call while continuing to fight for the greater cause.
10046 : You have my personal thanks, %, and those of the entire Allied Forces.
10047 : The Voidwalkers have been repelled for now, but if the past has taught us anything, we've not seen the last of them.
10048 : ...A war on two fronts. Hardly an ideal situation, but we must fight on. I trust that you will continue to stand with us, %.
10049 : In the meantime, take this as a token of our gratitude. Use it well, that you might be prepared when duty calls again.
10050 : I am sure you understand why we have summoned you on such short notice. Yes, it does indeed concern the Voidwalkers.
10051 : Recently, however, some new facts have come to light. Reports confirm a new substance that can be culled from those planes-walking fiends.
10052 : It is said to possess two separate forms: one is that of a crystal, the other of a more granular structure resembling cruor. Its alabaster hue, however, serves to distinguish it from that vermilion currency.
10053 : While it may exhibit crystalline properties, it is unlike any specimen of crystal we have heretofore examined. The oft-used phrase shrouded in mystery does not begin to describe how it baffles even our most accomplished researchers.
10054 : We may have nothing more to guide us than conjecture, but we cannot discard the possibility that this mineral is an integral piece in the calamitous puzzle that Vana'diel faces. Do not hesitate to collect as large a sample as possible of this mysterious mineral.
10055 : Should you require further intelligence, seek out a Voidwatch Officer. As they are the ones who operate in the field, they should be privy to the most current of information.
10056 : Furthermore...
10057 : Whether as hardened stone or dust deposits, this substance is less than abundant.
10058 : Voidwatch Officers should be willing to part with some samples, however, should you fail to harvest any off of Voidwalker corpses.
10059 : No matter the method by which you obtain it, this mineral should shine new light on this catastrophe and allow you to more efficiently aid our cause.
10060 : To the extent of our knowledge, there is no new planar rift activity, but you of all people should understand the spontaneous nature of these interdimensional disturbances. None of us can let our guard down for even a moment.
10061 : Archduke Kam'lanaut expects great things of you as well. It is quite regrettable that he could not honor us with his presence today, but he is a busy man with many entice--er, engagements.
10062 : Now that you understand how you can be of service, it is time you got to your duties. Let us conclude this parley.
10063 : It appears that you have arrived at a new survival guide provided by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Common sense dictates that you should now be able to teleport here from similar tomes throughout the world.
10064 : Before you lies a survival guide penned by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. It touches on such topics as teleportation and battle records.
10065 : It appears that you have arrived at a new survival guide provided by the Servicemen's Mutual Aid Network. Common sense dictates that you should now be able to teleport here from similar tomes throughout the world.
10066 : Before you lies a survival guide penned by the Servicemen's Mutual Aid Network. It touches on such topics as teleportation and battle records.
10067 : What chapter will you read? None. Teleportation Assistance. Field Support. Other mysteries.
10068 : The meticulously illuminated text within explains that adventurers may travel to the location of any previous books visited after paying a sum of gil or the requisite amount of tabs.
10069 : No other survival guide locations have been recorded. Visiting another one would certainly alleviate this issue.
10070 : Where will you travel? Nowhere. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Previous page. Next page.
10071 : It will cost # gil to teleport to %. (# gil on hand)
10072 : All mog tablets have currently been found, so you may teleport to % at no charge.
10073 : Travel to %? [Add to favorites/Delete from favorites]. Up and away! I'm down and out.
10074 : ## Travel to %? [Add to favorites/Delete from favorites]. Travel using # gil. (# gil) Travel using # tab[/s]. (# total) Not just yet.
10075 : You do not have enough tabs.
10076 : The records indicate you have fought valiantly for Vana'diel for # hour[/s].
10077 : At the bottom of the page is a reminder. It perfunctorily states that you may receive % once you have logged a total of # hours.
10078 : As per the custom noted within, you are eligible to receive % for the # hour[/s] of fighting you've accrued.
10079 : Accept the reward? Yes, please. No, thanks.
10080 : You may change the way you select areas listed in Teleportation Assistance.
10081 : Any changes to make? Keep course. Select by region. Select by content.
10082 : Area selection will now be made by [region/content].
10083 : Nowhere for now. Select from amongst favorites. Original release areas. Rise of the Zilart areas. Chains of Promathia areas. Treasures of Aht Urhgan areas. Wings of the Goddess areas. . . . . . . Seekers of Adoulin areas.

10087 : Your list of favorites is full. You must remove an existing entry to add new ones.
10088 : Remove which entry? None of these. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
10089 : Well, if this isn't the cat's meow. There is something you wish to ask of me? Hoping to have me shed some light on a particular matter?
10090 : ...This is wholly unexpected.
10091 : I've seen futures both brighter and darker, but in each at least there was a future.
10092 : Ah, but those feathered wings represent a new hope. A possibility to ensure that what should come to be...does come to be.
10093 : Perhaps it's best if we not paw around here, and consult Atomos instead. Ask his opinion.
10094 : Which means that you'll have need of this.
10095 : This should provide entry into what we call the Walk of Echoes.
10096 : The entrance there is the same as the entrance here--a cavernous maw. Gaping expanse of space.
10097 : %, you have come. Shown your face before me.
10098 : Alexander's cry has reached my ears.
10099 : Ah, I have awaited you. Hoped for this chance.
10100 : Unfurling here before you is the Walk of Echoes.
10101 : If you look above, you will see the prime avatar Atomos given physical form...
10102 : Or so you would think. No, the entire Walk of Echoes itself is Atomos. Its body and soul.
10103 : Some refer to him as the destroyer of worlds, for he feeds on futures that shall not come to pass. Whose existence is forbidden.
10104 : I trust you remember that Atomos consumes all futures that are forbidden.
10105 : And I'm sure the one question that must be pulling at your mind--bothering you to no end--is why Atomos is not feasting on your dark future as we speak.
10106 : I, too, have pondered that very question, and I will not play cat and mouse with you--that future is not a forbidden one.
10107 : There is nothing that I can do, what with Atomos so intricately connected to the laws of this world. So important to the way Vana'diel plays out.
10108 : Oh? That's not why you're here?
10109 : Why are you here? I need Iroha to be accepted. No real reason.
10110 : Come, come. We all know that's a bald-faced lie. Nothing could be further from the truth.
10111 : Out with it. You'll never get what you wish for unless you ask.
10112 : What a perplexing conundrum.
10113 : I am quite lucky to have been protected by the Goddess, but you...a great pair of white wings has wrapped you in its embrace, although I'm hard-pressed to say why. I haven't got a whit of an idea.
10114 : But those without such a boon cannot traverse the boundaries of time.
10115 : Why would you think there would be a means to save her?
10116 : You should count your blessings that Phoenix felt the need to save her at all. Most would have been left by the wayside.
10117 : Why that dour look? Don't tell me you're going to come mewling some trite complaint.
10118 : Well? Of course I'm upset! Isn't there anything we can do? I...suppose not.
10119 : An unsurprising response, to be sure.
10120 : Of course you're upset. It's understandable.
10121 : Forgive my starkness. A thousand apologies.
10122 : But don't mistake my honesty for callousness. Your story has shook me to the bones. Sent a chill up my spine.
10123 : I'm still letting it sink in--a force so mighty it can charm even Siren, the very mistress of seduction.
10124 : I'm positively at the end of my rope. My wits' end.
10125 : ...But there's still another option. Surely I don't need to tell you who Altana is.
10126 : Never once have I been able to set eyes on her.
10127 : But you...
10128 : A day may yet come when you will be able to see her in person. Become the most intimate of acquaintances.
10129 : Because you and yours are children of the Goddess.
10130 : And you bear a brighter future on your wings.
10131 : Wait! I have an idea. A flash of inspiration.
10132 : Altana may be able to provide Iroha the succor she seeks.
10133 : And if she can set everything right...it makes my whiskers twitch!
10134 : Her love is eternal, and surpasses the very laws of our world.
10135 : Of course, this leaves us the one small problem of how exactly you go about communing with her...
10136 : However, I know of a fabulous person who might have an answer... Lilisette.
10137 : I'll see if I can bring her to you. But it'll take some time.
10138 : Your first order of business should be to set things right in this world. Help subjugate the forces that threaten it.
10139 : I'll claw at the problem from a couple different angles in the meantime.
10140 : But never give up--spread your wings and soar to the heavens!
10141 : Aha!
10142 : %, it's you! Did you happen upon [that regal cat/Cait Sith] again?
10143 : Hmmm... Then I have a stranger question: have you been having any odd dreams lately?
10144 : %...
10145 : A first reunion was surprising enough, but a second!
10146 : This isn't going to be a happy one either, is it? What happened?
10147 : Cait Sith was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and I couldn't pluck the answers off her.
10148 : All I know is that it's got to be related to those dreams I've been having. You've seen them too, haven't you?
10149 : Is this another one of my dreams?
10150 : I've seen all manner of disturbing dreams lately. Perhaps because of Lilith's dark future...
10151 : You've seen similar ones too, haven't you?
10152 : Have you had odd dreams? Not dreams, but visions... Not really.
10153 : I knew I couldn't have been the only one!
10154 : They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.
10155 : Are you quite sure?
10156 : They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.
10157 : I wanted to reach out to them, but instead of grasping their hands I began to float upward, my form bound by light.
10158 : I became one with that selfsame light...and the last thing I saw was your face.
10159 : Your visage was even more noble than usual, and you had become...a god.
10160 : Huh? You had a different dream?
10161 : Wh-what!? That's an ill omen if I ever heard one!
10162 : Could such terror truly be what the world has in store for us?
10163 : Then in my dreams...all that light... Was it just a fraud, and I'm totally powerless!?
10164 : What kind of trickery is this!?
10165 : How do you respond? I'll think of something. I need your help. ...
10166 : Oh, I see how it is. You're going to run off and save the world!
10167 : Hehe! I knew I should have had more confidence in you!
10168 : And so...do you have a plan to meet with Altana?
10169 : You say Cait Sith was on about meeting Altana being our only chance. But I wonder...
10170 : Maybe we'll be able to think of something if we put our heads together.
10171 : %, you're really something else.
10172 : You're right. Maybe we can come up with something if we put our heads together.
10173 : I'm not sure exactly how to go about it, though.
10174 : Cait Sith said that our best bet may lie in meeting with Altana?
10175 : Even if we are the wings of the Goddess, that doesn't mean we have all the answers.
10176 : We might have to rack our brains for this one...
10177 : S-sorry for stepping out of line.
10178 : I might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but that doesn't mean I can't try my best to come up with something.
10179 : After all, it's up to us to protect both the future and the past--and I hope you'd expect nothing less of me!
10180 : So...Cait Sith said that meeting Altana might be our only shot?
10181 : We might be the Goddess's wings, but...well, nothing pops right to mind.
10182 : Maybe we'll find a solution if we put our heads together.
10183 : Oh? What is...
10184 : Goodness! By the stars, what just happened!?
10185 : That was no dream, right? Or was it? I...I saw the future!
10186 : Nothing super far away, mind you, but something close that the two of us can bring about together!
10187 : %, not only did I see the future, but also the past. Memories of the times we spent together, both warm and cold. A phantasmagoric kaleidoscope of images.
10188 : You're...absolutely sure I'm not dead? Hehehe!
10189 : Something awful's happened! Not good at all!
10190 : If it isn't that odd kitty cat!
10191 : Cait Sith...? What's wrong?
10192 : %, it's about that ambassador friend of yours. The person you've been looking for.
10193 : He found his way [here/to the Walk of Echoes]!
10194 : The Walk of Echoes?
10195 : Oh dear. Here. I'll let % explain the rest. Fill you in on the particulars.
10196 : I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!
10197 : How terrible must this foe be if he's managed to make his way [to this world/to the Walk of Echoes]?
10198 : %, I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!
10199 : Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!
10200 : Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!
10201 : That orb you carry...the light erased all my doubts and fears. I'm ready for whatever may come to pass.
