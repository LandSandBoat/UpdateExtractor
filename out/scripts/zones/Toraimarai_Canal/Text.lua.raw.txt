6627 : Let's go. Try not to get in the way.
6628 : Meow!
6629 : [/It might be time to head back to town./I have to be heading back soon./My reflexes are starting to slow./I believe it's almost time for a rest./A nice soft bed is looking good about now./We've been at this for a while now./Sorry, but I have some other chores to take care of./I'm starting to get kinda tired./I believe it's almost time for a rest.] [/I think I need a rest./Other duties call!/We should call it a day pretty soon./Shall we head back to town shortly?/Shall we call it quits soon?/I think I have enough energy for one last spurt!/Can we finish up here soon?/But I can keep going for a little while! <Yawn>.../Shall we head back to town shortly?]
6630 : It might be time to head back to town. I think I need a rest.
6631 : I have to be heading back soon. Other duties call!
6632 : My reflexes are starting to slow. We should call it a day pretty soon.
6633 : I believe it's almost time for a rest. Shall we head back to town shortly?
6634 : I've almost had enough for one day.
6635 : Whoops! Forgot to tell you, but I have to be somewhere soon.
6636 : I regret to inform you that my presence will be required in town shortly. I pray you do not think ill of me.
6637 : A nice soft bed is looking good about now. Shall we call it quits soon?
6638 : We've been at this for a while now. I think I have enough energy for one last spurt!
6639 : Sorry, but I have some other chores to take care of. Can we finish up here soon?
6640 : I'm starting to get kinda tired. But I can keep going for a little while! <Yawn...>
6641 : I believe it's almost time for a rest. Shall we head back to town shortly?
6642 : I've babysitted you long enough for one day. I will leave soon.
6643 : This is getting borrring...
6644 : [/We've been through a good number of enemies./I think I'm finally getting tired./We've done enough today, I think./We've proved ourselves in battle this day./Phew, I'm beat./Maybe just one more battle./We should call it day./Phew!

6645 : We've been through a good number of enemies. One more ought to do it.
6646 : I think I'm finally getting tired. Should we make the next battle our last?
6647 : We've done enough today, I think. Let's make the next battle our last.
6648 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6649 : <Puff, wheeze> Just one more battle, okay?
6650 : I'm starting to feel sorry for our opponents! Think I'll call it a day after the next one.
6651 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6652 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6653 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6654 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6655 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6656 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6657 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6658 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6659 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6662 : Are we done for the day? No problem. Until we meet again.
6663 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6664 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6665 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6666 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6667 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6668 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6669 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6670 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6671 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6672 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6673 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6674 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6675 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6676 : A parting gift!
6677 : Ha!
6678 : Back to the pit with you!
6679 : The tide of battle turns!
6680 : How do you like this!?
6681 : I saved this just for you!
6682 : I believe it is my turn!
6683 : Your time is up!
6684 : Time for action!
6685 : This battle is ours!
6686 : Try this on for size!
6687 : The tide of battle turns!
6688 : Taste my wrath!
6689 : Hisss! Superrr...attack!

6691 : I'm ready to fight.
6692 : I'm in top shape and ready to go!
6693 : We can start fighting any time.
6694 : I'm prepared for battle.
6695 : I feel good!
6696 : I'm ready to rumble!
6697 : Fit as a fiddle, and at your command.
6698 : I'm ready to fight anytime.
6699 : I'm good to go!
6700 : I'm ready when you are.
6701 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6702 : I'm prepared for battle.
6703 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.
6704 : I feel grrreat! Come on, let me at them!
6705 : [/Don't worry about me./No problem!/Nothing to worry about./Don't hold back on my account./This little scratch?/This little scratch?/Nice of you to worry./No problem!/Don't hold back on my account.] [/It's just a scratch./This is just a scratch!/Just a scratch./This is a mere scratch./Pay it no mind./I've had bigger paper cuts!/But I'm fine, it's just a scratch./This little scratch won't slow me down!/This is a mere scratch.]
6706 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6707 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6708 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6709 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6710 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6711 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6712 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6713 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6714 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6715 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6716 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6717 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6718 : I would hardly call this a scratch. Don't mind me, mind yourself.
6719 : Around seven out of nine lives rrremaining!

6721 : I should probably rest a little more. Just in case.
6722 : I'm not gonna let a slight wound like this keep me down! I'm ready for more!
6723 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6724 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6725 : I'm fine...really.
6726 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6727 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6728 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6729 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6730 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6731 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.
6732 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6733 : Hm... Our opponents are quite determined to make us work.
6734 : Around five out of nine lives rrremaining!
6735 : [/We should really take a break./I feel a little...lightheaded./That last fight took it out of me./Let's take a break, shall we?/I'm exhausted./Phew!/I'm exhausted./Phew.../Let's take a break, shall we?] [/I'm not ready for another battle./Maybe we should take a break./Let me catch my breath./No sense rushing into battle in this condition./Can you give me a minute./I think I've earned a break, don't you?/Can we sit down...for a bit...?/I think I need to lie down.../No sense rushing into battle in this condition.]
6736 : We should really take a break. I'm not ready for another battle.
6737 : I feel a little...lightheaded. Maybe we should take a break.
6738 : That last fight took it out of me. Let me catch my breath.
6739 : Let's take a break, shall we? No sense rushing into battle in this condition.
6740 : I need to take a break soon.
6741 : Hey, how about taking five?
6742 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6743 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6744 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6745 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6746 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...
6747 : Let's take a break, shall we? No sense rushing into battle in this condition.
6748 : <Puff> Tell me if you feel...you need rest... <Pant> I mean it...
6749 : Around three out of nine lives rrremaining...
6750 : [/We really should rest./No...no more.../Hold on.../I'm at my limit./Enough!/Whoa.../Please.../Can't...fight...any...longer.../I'm at my limit.] [/I don't think I can survive another fight./I gotta sit down.../I need to get my strength back.../Please let me recover my strength./Let me rest already!/I think I'm gonna fall over.../I need to sit down.../Must...rest.../Please let me recover my strength.]

6753 : Hold on... I need to get my strength back...
6754 : I'm at my limit. Please let me recover my strength.
6755 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6756 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6757 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6758 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6759 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6760 : Please... I need to sit down...
6761 : Can't...fight...any...longer... Must...rest...
6762 : I'm at my limit. Please let me recover my strength.
6763 : The enemy isn't going anywhere. Withdraw and regroup!

6781 : Hmm. Better keep an eye on my magic reserves.
6782 : Let's see now. I think my magic is about half gone.
6783 : My magic? It might be time to rest soon.
6784 : My magical reserves? Depleted to about the halfway mark.
6785 : I have around half of my magic left.
6786 : My magic is good for a while yet.
6787 : My magical reserves should suffice for now, but we best avoid taking unnecessary risks.
6788 : Are you relying on my magic? If so, we may need to rest soon.
6789 : I still have lots of magic left! Well, maybe half...
6790 : My magic? It might be time to keep an eye on my reserves.
6791 : Hmmm. I've used up half my magic already...

6804 : Almost out of magic!
6805 : My magic is running low.
6806 : Where'd all my magic go!?

6814 : I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
6815 : I've just leveled up, but with your help, it'll take no time at all to get to the next level!
6816 : Hey, I just leveled up, didn't I? Easy on the expectations there, partner.
6817 : Since I have just gained a level, it will be quite some time until I reach the next. Sorry to disappoint you, [sir/milady].
6818 : I've just gained a level. The next level is still quite a way off.
6819 : I just gained a level! You can't expect me to level again any time soon!

6821 : I've just gained a level, I know. But I still can't wait until I go up again!
6822 : I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
6823 : I just leveled up! We'll have to do something about your memory problem.

6828 : Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
6829 : There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
6830 : I still have to gain lots more experience, but I'll do my best!
6831 : My next level is still ages away. Why hurry? Don't worry, be happy!
6832 : I have made some progress, but the next level still eludes me.
6833 : Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
6834 : I have lots of work to do! I need more experience if I'm gonna get stronger!
6835 : I still have much to do. I must gain more experience in order to grow stronger.
6836 : Ho-hum. Still lots of work to do until my next level!
6837 : There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
6838 : My level won't rise if we stand around talking like this!
6839 : No, don't rrremind me!  Such a long way to go...

6843 : Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
6844 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6845 : I think I'm about half way there...
6846 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6847 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6848 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
6849 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
6850 : I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.

6852 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6853 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.

6858 : Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
6859 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6860 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
6861 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
6862 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
6863 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
6864 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
6865 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
6866 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
6867 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6868 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
6869 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?

6871 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
6872 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
6873 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
6874 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6875 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6876 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6877 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6878 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6879 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6880 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6881 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6882 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6883 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6884 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6885 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6886 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6887 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6888 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6889 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6890 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6891 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6892 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6893 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6894 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6895 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6896 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6897 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6898 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6899 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6900 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6901 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6902 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6903 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6904 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6905 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6906 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6907 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!

6991 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6992 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6993 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6994 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6995 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.

7432 : Accept this mission? Yes. No.
7433 : You have accepted the mission.
7434 : Summoning, you say?
7435 : Yes, I would like to name this magic summoning.
7436 : The divine texts mention it as the words used when the Star Sibyl was commanding the great beast, Fenrir.
7437 : At any rate, we are very close. Soon the magic of summoning will be complete.
7438 : Hmm...
7439 : Are you uneasy, Your Holiness?
7440 : Yes... Very.
7441 : Time is of the essence. The lines of battle are at Tahrongi Canyon, and draw close to Sarutabaruta.
7442 : The attack on Oztroja shall fail, and many flames of life will go out, like the Star Reading long ago.
7443 : Place your trust in me, Your Holiness. Windurst shall escape its fate of ruin.
7444 : The Book of the Gods has taught me everything.
7445 : It told me the meaning of the tower and the fountain. And it has taught me what the beast Fenrir truly is.
7446 : The door is sealed shut by some magical force.
7447 : A dreadful voice intones: This door is guarded by the Four Servants.
7448 : Enter the Animastery? Yes. No.
7449 : Leave the Animastery? Yes. No.
7450 : The door is open!
7451 : A gentle voice whispers: I will guide you to the first floor of Heavens Tower.
7452 : Warp to the first floor of Heavens Tower? Yes. No.
7453 : Are you sure you're finished here? Return to Heavens Tower. Keep looking around.
7454 : This book contains a history of the Horutoto Ruins.
7455 : Based on the literature housed in the Optistery, the Horutoto Ruins of Sarutabaruta date back to the time of the first Star Sibyl...
7456 : The architecture of the buildings, the technology used, the highly advanced magical theory... All of this points to the existence of an ancient civilization in the area.
7457 : This book contains a history of the Horutoto Ruins.
7458 : According to books on the towers, the mage who lost his life during the height of the tower battle was attempting to summon the great beast that lurked in the Full Moon Fountain...
7459 : With the destruction of the magical gizmos in the north tower, the great beast was freed to roam Sarutabaruta on nights of the full moon.
7460 : This book contains a history of the Horutoto Ruins.
7461 : The five towers of the Horutoto Ruins are arranged with four of the towers surrounding a central tower. The magical power that pours forth from the gizmos has been used to create many enspelled tomes.
7462 : Numerous researchers scrambled over each other to be the first to discover the source of this magical power. The mystery surrounding the towers was eventually solved by a famous hermit.
7463 : This is an old song about the legend of the Horutoto Ruins.
7464 : Led by a wondrous star, the people found their paradise.  A land verdant and bountiful, a land without cruelty or vice.
7465 : The shining star of six points does the wild beast bind. Fading into the southern sky, a fountain left behind.
7466 : You feel an overwhelming aura of foreboding from this tome. You can almost hear someone whispering for you to stay away...
7467 : You mustn't touch that!
7468 : That book is forbidden. As an experienced adventurer, you should be able to sense the danger. The ominous power that lurks within...
7469 : How did you come to be here? No one can enter this room except through my private chambers in Heavens Tower.
7470 : You need a special key to open that other door... The %...
7471 : ...Is it possible you have...? Have you found Karaha-Baruha's ring? The one that was lost all those years ago?
7472 : Did you find the ring? Yes. No.
7473 : Well, then. I should explain about this place.
7474 : There is no need for you to lie to me. Let me explain about this place.
7475 : This is the Animastery. It is the hidden sixth ministry, and was built almost twenty-five years ago.
7476 : The one who conducted his research here said this to me thirty years ago: The art of drawing magical power from the well of nature has been taken as far as it can go.
7477 : He formulated a theory for drawing magical power from living beings, as opposed to nature. This magic would manifest the same amount of power as the creature it was drawn from.
7478 : ...This new magical theory had the potential to threaten the lives of living beings, and so there were voices of opposition from among the five existing ministries.
7479 : However, we were in need of power. The power that could be gained from normal creatures was insufficient. We needed the near limitless energy that could be harnessed from a truly awesome entity...
7480 : Windurst was delivered from obliteration by that very power. But the price we paid for it... I'm sure you are aware of what we lost...
7481 : Please take the time to read the books here before you leave. If it was Karaha-Baruha's star that led you to this place, then I will not hold this trespass against you.
7482 : However, citizens of Windurst are forbidden to proceed past the Sealed Portal of the central tower. If you continue past this point, I will reconsider the matter of punishment.
7483 : I see it now, %... You have a star to guide you.
7484 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7485 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7486 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7487 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7488 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7489 : Now, listen close...
7490 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7491 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7492 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7493 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7494 : .........listen......
7495 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7496 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7497 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. The Sixth Ministry.
7501 : Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
7502 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
7503 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
7504 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
7505 : You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
7506 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
7507 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
7508 : Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
7509 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
7510 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
7511 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
7512 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
7513 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
7514 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
7515 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
7516 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
7517 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
7518 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
7519 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
7520 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
7521 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
7522 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
7523 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
7524 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
7525 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
7526 : You can only carry one %.
7527 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
7528 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
7529 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
7530 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
7531 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
7532 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
7533 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
7534 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
7535 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
7536 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
7537 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
7538 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
7539 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
7540 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...
