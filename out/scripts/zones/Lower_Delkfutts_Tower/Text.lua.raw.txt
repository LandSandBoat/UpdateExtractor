6983 : [/I've gained a fair amount of experience./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./Hmm./I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level./I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level./I think I must be almost halfway to my next level./I've come a long way towards my next level./We've been busy, huh?/I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level.] [/I must be close to halfway to my next level by now./Can't slow down now!/I must be almost halfway to my next level by now./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!/That was much faster than I expected./No time to be slacking off!/Must be close to halfway by now./I think I'm almost halfway to my next level./Let's not rest on our laurels, however!]
6984 : I've gained a fair amount of experience. I must be close to halfway to my next level by now.
6985 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
6986 : Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
6987 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6988 : I think I'm about half way there...
6989 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6990 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6991 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
6992 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
6993 : I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.
6994 : We've been busy, huh? I think I'm almost halfway to my next level.
6995 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6996 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.
6997 : I'm halfway there...maybe?
6998 : [/Hmm./This is a good pace!/Hmm./Well, well./Just a little more./Come on!/I'm past the halfway point./Just a little more!/Well, well.] [/Not too much further to my next level./Not much more to my next level!/Still need a little more experience for my next level./It appears my next level is not far off at all./My next level is not too far away./I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!/Not long now until I gain another level./My next level is almost within sight!/It appears my next level is not far off at all.]
6999 : Hmm. Not too much further to my next level.
7000 : This is a good pace! Not much more to my next level!
7001 : Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
7002 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7003 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
7004 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
7005 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
7006 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
7007 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
7008 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
7009 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
7010 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7011 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
7012 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?
7013 : [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
7014 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
7015 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
7016 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
7017 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7018 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
7019 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7020 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7021 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7022 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7023 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7024 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7025 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7026 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7027 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7028 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7029 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7030 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7031 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7032 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7033 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7034 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7035 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7036 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7037 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7038 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7039 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7040 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7041 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7042 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7043 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7044 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7045 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7046 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7047 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7048 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7049 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7050 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7051 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7052 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7053 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7054 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7055 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7056 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7057 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7058 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7059 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7060 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7061 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7062 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7063 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7064 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7065 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7066 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7067 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7068 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7069 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7070 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7102 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
7103 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
7104 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.

7111 : Only # [enemy/enemies] defeated so far. This doesn't even amount to a warm-up.
7112 : We've beaten at least two...right?
7113 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
7114 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
7115 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...

7117 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7118 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7119 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7120 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7121 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7122 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7123 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7124 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7125 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7126 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7127 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7128 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7129 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7130 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7131 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7132 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7133 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7134 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7135 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7136 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7137 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7138 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7139 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7140 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7349 : What exactly is going on here? There was no reason for Verena to be involved in the first place.
7350 : Sorry about making you wait, Lion. Now let's get going.
7351 : The problem is, we can't get near them without %.
7352 : You mean you didn't bring it?
7353 : Don't worry.
7354 : You again. What business do you have coming here?
7355 : The same as you. Isn't that good enough an answer?
7356 : I need no companions on my journey. And what do you think you can accomplish, coming here without %?
7357 : We knew you would have it. So, we're coming along for the ride.
7358 : Do as you wish.
7359 : Whatever. Aldo, let's go.
7360 : I am sorry. My name is Aldo, head of the Tenshodo.
7361 : Zeid... Just make sure you don't get in my way.
7362 : He never changes.
7363 : Just hold on a little bit longer, Verena. I'm coming.
7364 : Listen up, adventurers! You are to keep clear of Delkfutt's Tower! That's an order!
7365 : The northern line... The flow of energy has begun to reverse!
7366 : That's impossible!
7367 : Children of Vana'diel, I, Bahamut, ruler of the skies, have come to deliver you a warning!
7368 : The time has come... The arrival of the Keeper of the Apocalypse is near!
7369 : Come forth, my minions! Let the blood of the gods spill forth on the soil of their creation.
7370 : Why do we have to wait out here? What do they think we are, door boys? It's like they don't trust us...
7371 : Quiet, soldier. You were ordered to stand by, not whine like a child.
7372 : Sir, yes sir!
7373 : But what really is going on in there...? Why did the society call for our assistance...?
7374 : Crooked Arrow! Men! Ready your weapons and fall in!
7375 : Captain! The door...
7376 : Follow me and keep on guard!
7377 : What the...!?
7378 : What the hell happened here...? Are there any survivors?
7379 : Captain!
7380 : What is it, soldier?
7381 : I've found someone. He's...he's just a boy.
7382 : Son! Can you hear me? Are you all right?
7383 : He's still breathing. If we can revive him, he might be able to tell us what on Vana'diel happened here.
7384 : What are your orders, sir?
7385 : Get me Monber... Someone call the infirmary!
7386 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7387 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7388 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7389 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7390 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7391 : Now, listen close...
7392 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7393 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7394 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...

7403 : This is...
7404 : What...!?
7405 : %!
7406 : Where did you get that key?
7407 : The captain of the Ducal Guard!?
7408 : Well, well, well...
7409 : !?
7410 : Excellent timing. Great minds think alike, wouldn't you say, % and Tenzen?
7411 : I never thought it would be you two who helped me.
7412 : I, too, have some very important business on the other side of that door.
7413 : Ah, what a grand sight...
7414 : The five mothercrystals... It is this contraption that protects them as they slumber beneath Vana'diel.
7415 : Protects them...? So, that is the purpose of this tower!?
7416 : Exactly. The five crystals are connected by the five Crystal Lines that all converge on this very place.
7417 : For many centuries we have monitored the lines...protected the radiance of the crystals.
7418 : However, when the Wyrmking, Bahamut, arrived, the five crystal lines began acting strangely. We could no longer control them.
7419 : And then came Selh'teus.
7420 : He came...here?
7421 : Sir Nag'molada! Are you saying that the boy came here via the Crystal Line!?
7422 : Which means, by traveling back through the line, he can...
7423 : Exactly. He can reach the fifth crystal. However, it is not as easy as you may think. The lines were not built as a path for men.
7424 : They were built to gather the light of the mothercrystals.
7425 : The true reason Selh'teus was able to enter this place was because he was aided by a guardian of the crystals--a terrestrial avatar.
7426 : A terrestrial avatar...?
7427 : It is all clear now! Phoenix led me to this place to show me the way to the celestial capital of Al'Taieu!
7428 : Phoenix? Led you here? That is truly unfortunate. If this only had happened before Pso'Xja was reactivated...
7429 : Reactivated...? What do you mean by that, Nag'molada?
7430 : The ruins of Pso'Xja were once the homes of my Kuluu brothers and sisters. However, at the onset of the Kuluu war with the Zilart, the terrestrial avatars lent us their power and helped transform the area into an impenetrable stronghold.
7431 : And deep below the ruins is a device that blocks the flow of energy through the Crystal Line. Esha'ntarl has repaired that device...
7432 : Repaired it! Why would she do such a thing!?
7433 : I no longer know what the society is plotting. That is why I came here--to find out their true intentions!
7434 : ...
7435 : Ha ha ha! Are you surprised?
7436 : I guess that to you we ancients--Kuluu and Zilart--are all the same. However, that could not be further from the truth.
7437 : The Zilart were blessed with the ability to subliminally communicate with all those around them--they possessed the whisper of the soul. It was this ability that made the bonds between them unbreakable.
7438 : However, there were those who were born without the whisper--the Kuluu. My people were destined from birth to sit outside the bonds of the Zilartian community.
7439 : But we bystanders were able to ascertain the truth, and it was this that helped us survive the crusades of ten thousand years ago.
7440 : The Zilart, the terrestrial avatars, Selh'teus... Once again, their sins will deface Vana'diel and undermine her children.
7441 : That is terrible! If you know of such a battle brewing, why do you not attempt to stop it!?
7442 : Why must we fight the avatars!? Such a battle would be meaningless! Our true enemies are the Emptiness and the evil boy that is spreading it!
7443 : Hah. Is that what you have to say? Tenzen, when are you going to stop being led around on a leash like a measly dog? When are you going to see what the terrestrial avatars really want?
7444 : Listen. I told you this once before. Selh'teus is nothing but a traitor.
7445 : Ten thousand years ago, he prevented the Zilart from obtaining what they desired. Now, he is simply attempting the same thing.
7446 : The records stored in this Crystal Line observation equipment have shown me the reason why Selh'teus travels to the mothercrystals.
7447 : By touching the shards, he is able to drain their light...their power.
7448 : The crystal's power?
7449 : To accomplish our task, we had to gather the power of the crystals and fuse it into one.
7450 : And to do that, we needed to repair and revive the Zilartian machines that were damaged in the accident that occurred ten thousand years ago. With the machines working again, we were able to slowly draw the light of the crystals.
7451 : When he realized he could not single-handedly take on the whole nation of Jeuno, he turned to the crystals instead. And when he laid his hands upon them, their power flowed from the facets like water rushing from a broken dam. This sudden loss of power resulted in a disruption in the space surrounding the crystals...
7452 : Without the life-giving light of the crystals shining upon it, the space became overwhelmed with darkness--with Emptiness.
7453 : But, Selh'teus first appeared on Vana'diel the same time as Bahamut.
7454 : In my home nation, there were many reports of the Emptiness eating its way through the land, long before Bahamut even arrived...
7455 : Wait! You just said that you were slowly drawing the light of the crystals...
7456 : That would mean that the cause of the Emptiness in the East is you--the Zilart!
7457 : Hmph. I was beginning to wonder when you would realize that, Tenzen.
7458 : But don't misunderstand us. It was never our intention to harm Vana'diel with the Emptiness.
7459 : While we lay in slumber for the past ten thousand years, things changed. The crystals changed.
7460 : Especially the fifth crystal, deep below Al'Taieu.
7461 : When the celestial capital was destroyed and sunk to the bottom of the sea, the crystal was damaged. The data that it returns is very odd indeed.
7462 : However, you need not worry. Once the Gate of the Gods is opened, the crystals will return to their former state.
7463 : And once they do, the Emptiness will disappear in the crystal's radiance, and the Zilart will have accomplished their dream.
7464 : Only the wretched terrestrial avatars stand in our way...!
7465 : That is enough! Before I slice you in two, I will give you the opportunity to recall the words of Diabolos!
7466 : Wake up! You are all bound like marionettes by the chains of Promathia!
7467 : When the Gates of Paradise open, our world will be no more!
7468 : But with an end always comes a new beginning...
7469 : Tenzen! Have you asked your precious Phoenix what actually happens when our world is no more?
7470 : What do you mean!?
7471 : Yes. The world we live in now is nothing but an illusion. Compared to Paradise, Vana'diel is a cesspool festering with pain and suffering, lost hopes and dreams...
7472 : Strict values waver in the winds of uncertainty, while you pilfer your precious time struggling to recognize the truths that peer back at you through the darkness. You are inclined to search aimlessly for hints of who you truly are, though you rarely discover them, and it is this failure that ultimately forces you to tread a vague path through your miserable lives.
7473 : Even confessions of the soul result in disagreement and inconsistency, thrusting your pitiful masses into utter chaos. It is this chaos that breeds evil--an evil that propels you into justifying deeds of malevolence to maintain your false sense of purity.
7474 : You were born into this world and this is the only world you know. That is why you fear its end. You fear it and you fight it.
7475 : The terrestrial avatars recognized this characteristic of your people and have used it to their advantage. Why? Have you ever wondered why the terrestrial avatars are named so? It is because they, too, were born on Vana'diel. If Vana'diel returns to Paradise, they will be nothing but mere animals!
7476 : B-but...
7477 : You people are nothing but puppets, your strings tied to the fingers of the terrestrial avatars, destined to a life of slavery. Why not open your eyes to the truth?
7478 : Now that you realize your true enemies are the avatars who claim to protect you, your journey through the darkness is over.
7479 : You can leave the rest to me. I shall change your destinies.
7480 : ...!
7481 : The light Selh'teus has gathered from the mothercrystals... If the celestial capital of Al'Taieu still does exist, then the Zilart's plan is...
7482 : This monitoring device will inform me of the crystal's memories... The memories will guide me...
7483 : Let your memories show me the truth I seek!
7484 : Argh... I'm only receiving partial data... There's still too much interference coming from the fifth crystal...
7485 : But that image... I've seen it somewhere before... It was...the Chamber of Eventide. And that was Esha'ntarl!
7486 : Yes... It's all clear now...
7487 : Could it be...?
7488 : Nag'molada said that the terrestrial avatars are using us... Using us to prevent people from waking up and realizing the truth...?
7489 : But if that is true... The people who gave their lives for this flame... I... I...
7490 : Phoenix! Answer me!
7491 : To grant you this form, lives were lost, villages destroyed...
7492 : The lifeblood you drank from my people...was it not to save Vana'diel!? Was it not to breathe hope back into her children!?
7493 : ... And once again you tell me to visit Fenrir...
7494 : Where? The southern tower of Pso'Xja?
7495 : Is that all!?
7496 : We shall see what truths the final avatar presents us with. We shall see if we are simply being made fools of!
7497 : Something huge is bearing down upon you!
7498 : Now is not the time for that!
7499 : The surroundings are calm and quiet...
7504 : mes1
7505 : W-were y-you the one th-th-that defeated the hi-hideous b-b-b-b-beast?
7506 : Oh, th-thank you s-s-s-so m-much. I-I've b-b-b-b-been t-trying to g-g-get up enough s-s-s-strength to f-face it for the p-p-p-past f-few weeks, b-b-b-but I-I-I-I...

7508 : Hm? R-R-Raibaht s-s-s-sent you? You w-w-want to know wh-wh-where I hid th-the alti-ti-ti-timeter?

7510 : Wh-what? You h-have one? W-w-well, then ch-ch-check the s-streetlamps in L-L-L-Lower J-Jeuno. Th-that's where I-I hid th-the altimeter.
7511 : G-good luck, [s-s-sir/m-m-ma'am]. N-n-now where's th-th-the exit to this p-p-p-p-place?
7512 : The frightened adventurer told you to check the streetlamps in Lower Jeuno for the hidden %. Which one could it be in?
7513 : A bloodthirsty monster has appeared!
7514 : Wow, this place hasn't changed a bit.
7515 : The last time I was here...
7516 : I've finally found you, my elusive treasure.
7517 : Not a few thieves would be keen to get their paws on this.
7518 : Who's there!?
7519 : That treasure belongs to me!
7520 : Hmph. It was hardly worth rrraising my hackles for a wee thing like you.
7521 : Go ahead and underestimate me for my size! You'll be sorry!
7522 : You're the one that'll be sorry if you don't scamper off some place. I hope you came rrready for a fight!
7523 : I'm ready for anything!

7535 : So you weren't always the best of friends, I see. In any case, we should begin our search.
7536 : It would prrrobably be best if we split up to cover more ground.

7572 : Why did Luto have to go and get that % for me? I'm perfectly capable of fixing this minor hitch on my own!
7573 : All I have to do is project an image of my normal form. Easy as picking rarab tails in Sarutabaruta...except I'm feeling a bit off lately. Having trouble concentrating, that's all.
7574 : This place should help put me in the right frame of mind.
7575 : Hm?
7576 : That's the adventurer I saw in Jeuno...
7577 : In this shape I stand out more than a dhalmel at a Tarutaru tea party. Luto will notice me for sure...
7578 : What have we here?
7579 : Well, that form is as good as any other.
7580 : Perfect! Even without my special costumes, my disguises are pure genius!
7581 : But I can't keep running away from Luto forever...
7582 : There must be something I can do!

7628 : Miledo-Shiraddo!
7629 : See, I told you! I don't need any fancy % to return to my normal form!
7630 : You knew about that, huh?
7631 : Did anyone hear that sound? I'll just go and investigate.
7632 : I'm sorry you had to traipse all the way here on my account.
7633 : I think it's time for a re-introduction. I'm Miledo-Shiraddo. I've heard all about you from Luto.
7634 : She's told me a lot about you, too. I bet you were surprised to see your own face looking back at you. Nobody has ever seen through one of my disguises!
7635 : I'm famous among thieves for my expertise in taking on different appearances. They even gave me a nickname: The Chameleon.
7636 : Luto has been gone for a while... I wonder if she's okay.
7637 : Luto has been gone for a while... We should go check on her.

7647 : Luto has been gone for too long. %, let's go check on her.
7648 : Here you are. What's taking so long?
7649 : Hello, my name is Luto Mewrilah.
7650 : Not again! I'm the only Luto Mewrilah arrround here, pal! Show your true self!
7651 : I am Luto Mewrilah. Gweh. Luto...Mewrilah...gweh.
7652 : Gweh?
7653 : Some kind of doppelganger!
7654 : Why would that creature take on Luto's form...?
7655 : Luto's form sure is popular lately...

7680 : Hey, this is the trrreasure I was after when I first met Miledo.
7681 : What happened was...
7682 : <Pant...pant...> You're a lot...tougher than...I gave you crrredit for...
7683 : <Huff...puff...> You're not...so bad...yourself...furball...
7684 : Furball? I have a name, you know. Call me Luto.
7685 : Luto, huh? Well, I'm Miledo-Shiraddo.
7686 : Miledo-Shiraddo... I've heard that name before. So, how long have you been a thief?
7687 : This is my second heist.
7688 : Your second...!? You're a quick learner.
7689 : How about you and I pairing up and going after some trrruly valuable treasure?
7690 : You and me...? Hmmm, I've never had a partner before.
7691 : Here's my suggestion. We only cooperate when we're aiming for a rrreally big score.
7692 : But if you hold me back, I'll leave you choking in the dust. Clear?
7693 : This partnership is for our mutual prrrofit. I don't need any amateurs dragging me down.
7694 : That makes two of us.
7695 : You've got yourself a deal, fur...Luto.
7696 : As a symbol of our deal, we decided to leave this particular treasure untouched.
7697 : Proof of our partnership!
7698 : Thinking back on it now, we were nowhere near rrready to tackle this challenge.
7699 : You know, Luto, when we first met, you mentioned not wanting anyone to hold you back. And look at how far we've come!
7700 : That's true. Who could've imagined the wild adventures we've had?
7701 : And I hope we keep on having them, Miledo.
7702 : Me too! Heh heh.
7703 : Let's put this back where it belongs.
7704 : Well, I'd better be going. I'll show up again when you least expect it!
7705 : Oh, you can have this % as a memento. I'm sure an adventurer could find some use for it. Don't worry! If you get stuck in some shape, you can always find %!
7706 : Oh, and you can also take your pick from one of these. They can help you with your battle tactics.
7707 : Which do you choose? %. %. %.
7708 : Are you sure? That's the one. No! Wait!
7709 : Here you go!
7710 : What about the other two, you ask? You only get one, greedy! See you around!

7808 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
7809 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
7810 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
7811 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
7812 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
7813 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
7814 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
7815 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
7816 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
7817 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
7818 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
7819 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
7820 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
7821 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
7822 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
7823 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
7824 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
7825 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
7826 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
7827 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
7828 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
7829 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
7830 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
7831 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
7832 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
7833 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
7834 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
7835 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
7836 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
7837 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
7838 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
7839 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
7840 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
7841 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
7842 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
7843 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
7844 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
7845 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
7846 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
7847 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
7848 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
7849 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
7850 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
7851 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%

11801 : Master...
11802 : How do you respond? Are you all right? What happened?
11803 : It is nothing. I needed a few days of respite.
11804 : I pray it was the orb that led you here? For a brief moment I feared that we would not meet again in this world.
11805 : I have learned that all the energies of the mothercrystals converge upon this very tower.
11806 : ...And that is why I have come. To see if we may be able to borrow but a fraction so that we may set things right.
11807 : The crystal...it murmured something to me... The chains of Promathia.
11808 : Perhaps there is another trial for you to overcome.
11809 : I ask you, please do as the crystal bids.
11810 : Behind every door you open is another meeting that could decide the fate of Vana'diel.
11811 : The crystal has laid out a path for you to walk, and I fear it is one you must traverse without my aid.
11812 : You must strive ever forward, finding a chance meeting that could decide the fate of Vana'diel.
11813 : The crystal has laid out a path for you to walk, and I fear it is one you must traverse without my aid.
11814 : The orb cries out for light...your journey is what will fill it with everlasting radiance.
11815 : Master, another path was laid before you, and as you walked it you encountered one who would shape your future.
11816 : There is but one last step you must take to bring light unto the orb.
11817 : Did it not show you a particular person when it guided you here?
11818 : ...It does not surprise me to hear that Prishe appeared before you.
11819 : Oft would you speak to me of the adventures the two of you shared.
11820 : The orb does naught without just cause. You must seek her out and let the winds of fate blow you where they may.
11821 : Have anything to say? I'd like you to meet Tenzen. Where will you go?
11822 : You...you wish for me to meet a man named Tenzen from the Far East?
11823 : I should not be so taken aback. It is only natural for my path to cross with his in this era.
11824 : Of course I am intimately familiar with...Sir Tenzen.
11825 : He was the one who strongly insisted that I train under you and learn all I can.
11826 : So it shall be.
11827 : But before that can happen, you must pass the trials set before you by the chains of Promathia.
11828 : Recall what happened between you and Lion. The flow of even the mightiest river can be altered with a single stone.
11829 : Although I had hoped to give my regards to Prishe in person first.
11830 : But perhaps you are right--meeting with Sir Tenzen is paramount.
11831 : The appearance of new rifts in Vana'diel has surely not escaped your notice.
11832 : I feel it prudent to examine them for myself.
11833 : While you are pursuing your destiny regarding the chains of Promathia, I will go on ahead and learn what I can about Escha.
11834 : Recall what happened between you and Lion. The flow of even the mightiest river can be altered with a single stone.
11835 : Although I had hoped to give my regards to Prishe in person first.
11836 : But perhaps you are right--meeting with Sir Tenzen is paramount.
11837 : With your leave.
11838 : This leaves me with just one question--where can I meet with Sir Tenzen?
11839 : Where can Tenzen be found? Jeuno? Tavnazia? The Far East?
11840 : It stands to reason he would visit the fabled city. Let us rendezvous in Ru'Lude Gardens and seek him out.
11841 : That certainly is one possibility. Then let us head for Tavnazia.
11842 : Hold!
11843 : Who is--
11844 : Is that...Kagero?
11845 : How do you know my name?
11846 : Sir Tenzen makes way for Ru'Lude Gardens. You, too, would do best not to delay.
11847 : I shall ensure that Sir Tenzen arrives in Jeuno safely. I bid you await him in Ru'Lude Gardens.
11848 : Then the path before us is clear.
11849 : I find it doubtful that he would head back after having arrived only some few days before. Perhaps he is elsewhere?
