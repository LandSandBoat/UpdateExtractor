7160 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
7161 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
7162 : A parting gift!
7163 : Ha!

7186 : I'm ready when you are.
7187 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
7188 : I'm prepared for battle.
7189 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

7192 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
7193 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
7194 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
7195 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
7196 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
7197 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
7198 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
7199 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
7200 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
7201 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
7202 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
7203 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

7208 : I'm not gonna let a slight wound like this keep me down! I'm ready for more!
7209 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
7210 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
7211 : I'm fine...really.
7212 : I think I still can push on for a while.
7213 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
7214 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
7215 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
7216 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
7217 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

7224 : That last fight took it out of me. Let me catch my breath.
7225 : Let's take a break, shall we? No sense rushing into battle in this condition.
7226 : I need to take a break soon.
7227 : Hey, how about taking five?
7228 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
7229 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
7230 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
7231 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
7232 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...
7233 : Let's take a break, shall we? No sense rushing into battle in this condition.

7241 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
7242 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
7243 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
7244 : Enough! Let me rest already!
7245 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
7246 : Please... I need to sit down...
7247 : Can't...fight...any...longer... Must...rest...
7248 : I'm at my limit. Please let me recover my strength.

7270 : My magical reserves? Depleted to about the halfway mark.
7271 : I have around half of my magic left.
7272 : My magic is good for a while yet.
7273 : My magical reserves should suffice for now, but we best avoid taking unnecessary risks.
7274 : Are you relying on my magic? If so, we may need to rest soon.
7275 : I still have lots of magic left! Well, maybe half...
7276 : My magic? It might be time to keep an eye on my reserves.

7300 : I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
7301 : I've just leveled up, but with your help, it'll take no time at all to get to the next level!
7302 : Hey, I just leveled up, didn't I? Easy on the expectations there, partner.
7303 : Since I have just gained a level, it will be quite some time until I reach the next. Sorry to disappoint you, [sir/milady].

7305 : I just gained a level! You can't expect me to level again any time soon!

7307 : I've just gained a level, I know. But I still can't wait until I go up again!
7308 : I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.
7309 : I just leveled up! We'll have to do something about your memory problem.
7310 : It's so farrr away...

7314 : Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
7315 : There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
7316 : I still have to gain lots more experience, but I'll do my best!
7317 : My next level is still ages away. Why hurry? Don't worry, be happy!
7318 : I have made some progress, but the next level still eludes me.
7319 : Not even close... I still have much experience to gain.
7320 : I have lots of work to do! I need more experience if I'm gonna get stronger!
7321 : I still have much to do. I must gain more experience in order to grow stronger.

7328 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
7329 : Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
7330 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
7331 : I think I'm about half way there...
7332 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
7333 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
7334 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
7335 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
7336 : I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.
7337 : We've been busy, huh? I think I'm almost halfway to my next level.
7338 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
7339 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.

7345 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7346 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
7347 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
7348 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
7349 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
7350 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
7351 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
7352 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
7353 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7354 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
7355 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?

7357 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
7358 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
7359 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
7360 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7361 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
7362 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7363 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7364 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7365 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7366 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7367 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7368 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7369 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7370 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7371 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7372 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7373 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7374 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7375 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7376 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7377 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7378 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7379 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7380 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7381 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7382 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7383 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7384 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7385 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7386 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7387 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7388 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7389 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7390 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7391 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7392 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7393 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7394 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7395 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7396 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7397 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7398 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7399 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7400 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7401 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7402 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7403 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7404 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7405 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7406 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7407 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7408 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7409 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7410 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7411 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7412 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...

7851 : The mirror is cracked, %. Now what do we do with it?
7852 : I smashed the mirror without thinking. Now what do we do with it, %?
7853 : Well, the mirror is harmless now. What should we do with it, %?
7854 : I've damaged the mirror, %. What should we do with it?
7855 : I cracked the mirror, %. What should we do with it?
7856 : Seven years of bad luck can't be that bad...can it? What should we do with the mirror, %?
7857 : I've shattered the mirror, %. What do we do with it now?
7858 : Smashing the mirror was the only thing I could think of. What do I do with it now, %?
7859 : Breaking the mirror was my only choice. What do I do with it now, %?
7860 : Looks like seven years of bad luck for me. What do I do with the mirror now, %?
7861 : I've damaged the mirror. What should we do, %?
7862 : I had no choice but to break the mirror. What do you suggest we do with it now, %?
7863 : Take it to Luto? That would be best. I don't think so.
7864 : I suppose you're right. Our Mithran friend seems well informed about Near Eastern artifacts.
7865 : Of course! Luto would know what to do!
7866 : You could be right. She does know a lot about Near Eastern artifacts.
7867 : Why, of course. Our Mithran associate would be the perfect choice, considering her area of expertise.
7868 : You're right. After all, she knows a lot about such objects.
7869 : Good idea. No one else would know more about Near Eastern objects than her.
7870 : Good idea. Luto knows a lot about Near Eastern artifacts.
7871 : Of course! Luto is the perfect person to ask!
7872 : You're probably right. She's the expert on all things Near Eastern.
7873 : Luto? Oh, the Mithra in Jeuno! Yes, she would be the perfect person to help us!
7874 : Why, of course. Our Mithran associate would be the perfect choice, considering her area of expertise.
7875 : Hmmm... Considering her field of expertise, you are probably right.
7876 : Are you sure? Our Mithran friend seems well informed about Near Eastern artifacts.
7877 : Are you sure? I really think Luto would know what to do!
7878 : Are you sure? She does know a lot about Near Eastern artifacts.
7879 : Are you sure? Our Mithran associate would be the perfect choice, considering her area of expertise.
7880 : Oh? But I thought she would be the best person to talk to about the mirror.
7881 : Are you sure? I don't think I know anyone with more knowledge about the Near East than Luto.
7882 : Are you sure? Luto knows a lot about Near Eastern artifacts.
7883 : Are you sure? I really think Luto is the perfect person to ask!
7884 : Are you sure? She is the expert on all things Near Eastern.
7885 : Luto? Oh, the Mithra in Jeuno! Wouldn't she be the perfect person to help us?
7886 : Are you sure? Our Mithran associate would be the perfect choice, considering her area of expertise.
7887 : That's fine with me. But name one person you know who has more knowledge on Near Eastern artifacts than Luto.
7888 : You know, this mirror really does look similar to the Glass of All-Seeing...
7889 : You know, this mirror really does look similar to the Glass of All-Seeing...
7890 : You know, this mirror really does look similar to the Glass of All-Seeing...
7891 : You know, this mirror really does look similar to the Glass of All-Seeing...
7892 : You know, this mirror really does look a lot like the Glass of All-Seeing...
7893 : You know, I couldn't help but notice how much this mirror resembles the Glass of All-Seeing...
7894 : You know, this mirror really does look similar to the Glass of All-Seeing...
7895 : You know, this mirror really does look similar to the Glass of All-Seeing...

7900 : The cyclopean crystal is emitting a radiant glow.
7901 : You successfully hew # [shard/shards] from the crystal!
7902 : The crystal is badly damaged. Any more attempts at shard retrieval may shatter it.
7903 : The crystal is glowing brighter than before...
7904 : Yaaaaaarrrgh!!!
7905 : <Huff, puff>...
7906 : No. 'Twas no better than your last effort.
7907 : What in the world...<gasp>...do you mean? How can there have been...<pant>...any indecision in that!?
7908 : You mask it with blind aggression, but these eyes will not be tricked. Like the fool who tries to swim clad in armor, your movements are encumbered by indecision still.
7909 : Listen to me, boy. No man can undo his past.
7910 : Every man gladly clings on to his joys and successes. But as a ship raises anchor that it might sail towards the horizon, so too must a man bear the weight of his failures if he would move forward.
7911 : I shall share with you a pearl of wisdom.
7912 : He who would toast with victory's sweetest nectar must first partake of defeat's bitterest victuals.
7913 : These are the words of my erstwhile teacher.
7914 : Huh? Why foul your mouth with something bitter? That makes not a whit of sense...
7915 : <Sigh>... In time, you will come to understand. For now, stay focused on the enemy!
7916 : Hm? You're the adventurer from before...
7917 : Forgive me my introspection, but your resemblance to an acquaintance of decades past evokes within me memories of bygone days.
7918 : <Puff, pant> All right...who's next...?
7919 : Ah.
7920 : Indecisive, am I!? Yaaaaaarrrgh!!!
7921 : Uwaaaaaah! Stop! H-hold your morbols--I mean, chocobos!
7922 : Hm. A marginal improvement.
7923 : Blaaarrrgh!!!
7924 : Huh? Not an Orc?
7925 : Th-that was uncalled for...
7926 : I know that voice...
7927 : Be strong, man!
7928 : Int...Intelligence Operative...<gasp>...Lharant...<wheeze>...reporting, sir...
7929 : So, the dauntless agent who had infiltrated the den of Orcs was you all along! Altana's breath, 'tis good to see you alive...if somewhat the worse for wear.
7930 : No need for concern, sir. The internal injuries sustained from that fell blow are already--<cough, hack>--on the mend.
7931 : More importantly, I come bearing intelligence on the latest Orcish activities. As breathing triggers some discomfort still, I'd be most obliged if you could lean closer...
7932 : (Th-this is...)
7933 : (Magnificent! Magnificent beyond words! So, this is the fruit of twenty years of labor!)
7934 : (Aaah, Master Zogbog! No see you long time!)
7935 : (Egads, Mekglok! How you've aged! Though two decades would do this to any Orc, to be sure.)
7936 : (Well pleased am I with your dedication. Entrusting the blueprints to you was a decision most wise.)
7937 : (Twenty year pass already? Me very enjoy work, so no feel like twenty year!)
7938 : (Gahaha! Dependable as ever, I see! Now, tell me. Is it operational?)
7939 : (Right now me inject magic, Master Zogbog. It be ready soon.)
7940 : (Ah! Me want to show Master Zogbog something else. This way please come.)
7941 : <Gasp>!
7942 : (D-do my eyes play at mischief? Dare I hope that before me stands a mighty legion, ready to carry out my bidding?)
7943 : (You like, Master Zogbog? Me already finish inject magic, so they ready to move.)
7944 : (B-beyond my wildest dreams! With these miracles of science at my disposal, history shall be at my mercy!)
7945 : Gahahaha...
7946 : Gwahahahahaha!!!
7947 : ...And that concludes my report.
7948 : Wait! You mentioned seeing an Elvaan child being held captive...
7949 : Tell me what he looked like!
7950 : Regrettably, the dimness revealed little to me of the lad's appearance. I did, however, take note of the sword which lay at his side.
7951 : 'Twas a finely forged blade of fiery red steel, doubtless worth good coin. I suspect the lad is highborn.
7952 : A friend of yours, I gather? Would that I could've extracted the lad, but the Orcs standing sentry made the task quite impossible.
7953 : %, the fault is mine that he's been taken! We must rescue him!
7954 : I've not given you leave, boy! Your training isn't complete!
7955 : Curses! He stands not a chance on his own. Lharant, take word to Bostillette. We shall precede the main force in infiltrating the enemy's lair.
7956 : S-surely you jest!? You're but a few, and the statues are powerful and many!
7957 : There's no helping it. Insolent as he may be, we cannot stand idly by while the boy rushes headlong into grave peril. Now go, Lharant!
7958 : Very well, sir. Before I leave, I would give you this %. It should allow you to escape the enemy's notice when you steal into the caverns.
7959 : 'Tis designed for single use, but spares can be obtained from the covert communications chest should the need arise.
7960 : Please take all care, sir. I shall fly like the wind back to base camp.
7961 : (What? An Elvaan child on the loose, causing mayhem in Ghelsba, you say?)
7962 : (Excenmille, I'll wager...)
7963 : (Mekglok, ready the statues for immediate deployment.)
7964 : (If you mean small one, they already ready, Master Zogbog.)
7965 : (No. Not only those.)
7966 : (I would see the crowning glory of my legion christened in battle.)
7967 : (Huh? M-Master Zogbog, me not finish inject magic into big one. And many trial to run--)
7968 : (The enemy is but one scrawny Elvaan boy...plus what other vermin crawls out of the woodwork.)
7969 : (This shall serve perfectly as the final test run before I send forth my legion to conquer the past!)
7970 : (B-but Master Zogbog...)
7971 : (Enough! You will do as I say!)
7972 : (Y-yes, Master Zogbog.)
7973 : (Gahaha... The moment of our showdown is come, Excenmille.)
7974 : (By the honor of my fallen clan, I swear I shall have satisfaction of you this day!)
7975 : Uwaaah! I...I'm going to be dealt a d-d-dreadful death, kupo!
7976 : Look, I'm keeping the creature provoked, so there's nothing to be afraid of. You can stop hiding in mommy's skirt now.
7977 : Uwaaah! A monstrous moogle-eating mommy lizard! Don't let it n-n-near me, kupo!
7978 : A monstrous moogle-eating...what? Are you even listening to me? Nothing's going to hurt you, so get a grip already!
7979 : Uwaaah! Um...I mean, is that n-n-novennial attire you're sporting? It looks suitably swanky on you, k-k-kupo!
7980 : % apprises the moogle of the material shortage.
7981 : Uwaaah! I-I mean, oh dear, that's quite a p-p-pickle. But I'm not to blame. I would've made a d-d-dozen deliveries by now, weren't it for the repulsive reptiles raging for my moogle flesh, k-k-kupo.
7982 : A moogle stricken with an unnatural fear of the very thing he hunts... Can it get any more absurd?
7983 : H-hey, I'll have you know our duties were designated by a draw! I had no choice whatsoever in my posting, kupo!
7984 : Adventurer, I must beg a b-b-boon of you. I need this % delivered without delay to San d'Oria.
7985 : Deliver the %? I shall. Um...
7986 : My th-thanks, kupo! A more altruistic adventurer I've never known! Now, a moogle crafter awaits by the Tanners' Guild. Please see the skin s-s-safely to his hands.
7987 : The adventurer's obviously busy. Instead of bothering [him/her], why don't I just take it?
7988 : Uwaaah! You can't leave me to fend for myself, kupo! I won't last a minute on my own!
7989 : <Sigh>... Even unreasonable fear has limits, you know. Look, friend. We could really do with the help. As a fellow adventurer, won't you reconsider?
