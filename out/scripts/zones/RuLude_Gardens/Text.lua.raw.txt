6626 : Welcome, Master! This is your home, the Mog House, kupo!
6627 : I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!
6628 : I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!
6629 : First, the basics, kupo! Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to Mog House when you're in your Mog House, kupo!
6630 : Press it and the Mog House menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
6631 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
6632 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
6633 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
6634 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
6635 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
6636 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
6637 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
6638 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
6639 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
6640 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
6641 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
6642 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
6643 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
6644 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
6645 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
6646 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
6647 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
6648 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
6649 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
6650 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!
6651 : It's almost exactly the same as using your Mog Safe, kupo! Leave your items here for me to look after, kupo!
6652 : You can invite party and alliance members into your Mog House, kupo!
6653 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!
6654 : Are you sure, kupo? You know everything about your Mog House, kupo?
6655 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
6656 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
6657 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
6658 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
6659 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
6660 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
6661 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
6662 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
6663 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
6664 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
6665 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
6666 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
6667 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
6668 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
6669 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
6670 : It's all yours, kupo!
6671 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!
6672 : Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
6673 : I found this item in the back of one of the %'s drawers, kupo!
6674 : It's all yours, kupo!
6675 : I found this in the back of the %, kupo!
6676 : It must be a gift from the heavens, kupo! Here, take it, kupo!
6677 : I found this item inside the %, kupo!
6678 : Luck is on your side, kupo! Take it, kupo!
6679 : I fished this item out of the %, kupo!
6680 : It was very hard work, kupo... I'm very tired, kupo...
6681 : I found this behind the % painting, kupo!
6682 : This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6683 : Something clattered inside the % when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
6684 : It's all yours, kupo!
6685 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
6686 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6687 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
6688 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!

6699 : I found % inside the %, kupo!
6700 : Kupo...? I sense that this % is very, very special! You should go to the store where you bought it and ask about it, kupo!
6701 : Master! Master! Look what I found underneath the % this morning, kupo!
6702 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
6703 : Look what I found in your %!
6704 : You seem quite dehydrated lately, so maybe you should have it. I'll try putting some more grapes in the barrel and see if I can make any more, kupo!

6708 : Master, Master! I found this in the %, kupo!
6709 : It must be a present from the smilebringers. Here, you should have it, kupo!
6710 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Alaune. She's at the Westgate in Southern San d'Oria, kupo.
6711 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
6712 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
6713 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
6714 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
6715 : Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
6716 : Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!
6717 : We egg-stract this doodad from that doohickey, just like so, kupo...
6718 : Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
6719 : Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your %, when this % just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!
6720 : Isn't the aroma positively scrumptious? It's all yours, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6721 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6722 : Look at what I found while cleaning out the %: %!
6723 : Here, I want you to have it. In fact, I insist, kupo! Consider it a present for being the magnificent master that you are!
6725 : It all began with a raindrop,      or so the legend says...
6726 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
6727 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
6728 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
6729 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
6730 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
6731 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
6732 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
6733 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
6734 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
6735 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
6736 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
6737 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
6738 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
6739 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
6740 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
6741 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...
6742 : Do something? Read instructions. Change parameters. Teleport to key locations. Warp to home point. Receive items. Obtain 100,000,000 gil. Do nothing.
6743 : Hail, adventurer! I am the most mighty of moogles, my miraculous magicks able to alter all manner of arcane attributes!
6744 : But be forewarned, kupo! Once modified by moogle magick, your parameters cannot be restored to their prior state!
6745 : Furthermore, you may trade a moogle storage slip to me to wipe it clean, or mystically entrust its entire contents to me. Quite convenient, wouldn't you say?

6785 : Hang on! I have an amazing announcement!
6786 : The hallowed halls of your house are even more exciting! Why? Because now there's a second floor, kupo!
6787 : But before you bash your way in, I've got a trifling task for you to tackle.
6788 : Capricious Mithra cubs have cajoled critical information out of the M.H.M.U., and I want you to wrest it from them!
6789 : Visit the three nations and question them, kupo!
6790 : Now you know the nitty-gritty, so enjoy your new floor, kupo!
6791 : Kupopo? You mean you already know?
6792 : Magnificent and marvelous! Then proceed without delay!
6793 : Enjoy extra space to store your sundries!
6794 : Remodel your room to fit your finicky tastes!
6795 : Incorporate ostentatious overseas objects! All this and more!
6796 : But only on the second floor, kupo. I like the first floor as it is.
6797 : And as for your potted plants--they only persevere on the ground, kupo.
6798 : And moghancement effects only activate for furnishings fitted to the first floor.
6799 : Wish we could help more, but we spend enormous amounts of energy on one floor already!
6800 : Go forth and frolic in your new abode, kupo!
6801 : You can access the antechambers from the front door. Enjoy!
6802 : % might bring a certain je ne sais quoi to your Mog House, kupo!
6803 : What's this, then? Someone gave you this envelope, did they?
6804 : Wh-what is this!?
6805 : This rubbish does not fool me! I know a forgery when I see one.
6806 : Most unpleasant. Do not speak to me of this matter again!
6807 : You called for me, Your Majesty?
6808 : Francmage? I was not expecting you so soon. Monarlais...tell him.
6809 : Yes, sire.
6810 : Francmage, I've summoned you here today to talk about one thing--the Northlands investigation.
6811 : Oh, yes, that. Those Bastoker Humes are causing no end of trouble--saying they want to investigate here, there, and the other place...
6812 : It is true! The Humes are fools, and no better. Can they truly believe that some ancient power lies hidden in that forsaken wasteland?
6813 : Hah! Do they hope to find the gates to eternal Paradise there, in that lair of fiends most uncouth? Preposterous!
6814 : We must take control of this situation immediately. Still, we cannot let them walk about the Northlands freely. Who knows what they're plotting under the guise of this investigation.
6815 : Francmage, listen. Go with the investigation party, and keep a close eye on what our foreign friends do. They are up to something, it is certain.
6816 : I am sure nothing will come of this, but in case they do find something in that wasteland, do not let them take it. Understood?
6817 : As you command, my lord. I would give the very blood that runs in my veins if it were to further the cause of our kingdom. You can rely on me.
6818 : These foreigners are wily and faithless. Never let down your guard, and may the Goddess of the Dawn protect you in Her mercy.
6819 : The king has taken a beautiful queen, and I think a splendid addition to the royal family is not far off. An heir, perhaps...
6820 : We people of San d'Oria, too, must ever look to the future. The Elvaan must never fall behind foreigners, in power or faith.
6821 : I understand, Your Grace.
6822 : Very good. Do well, Francmage.
6823 : Yes, sire! My life for the Kingdom!
6824 : As I thought, there is nothing here... Only barren wastelands as far as the eye can see.
6825 : But there is something wrong about this place, I can feel it. I don't think-wink we should leave Xarcabard yet.
6826 : I agree. My nose has never failed me, but I don't smell anything. That's not normal. Something really terrrible must've happened here a long time ago.
6827 : Ridiculous. We cannot base our decisions on your feelings alone. You can stay and look for whatever terrible thing is supposed to be here, but I--
6828 : Help! Come quick! Raogrimm and Cornelia, they--
6829 : Ulrich? What happened!?
6830 : We were attacked by fiends, and Raogrimm and Cornelia fell down a crevice...
6831 : Oh, no! Oh, no!
6832 : Grr! Where!?
6833 : This way!
6834 : Raogrimm and Cornelia...where could they have gone?
6835 : We have to assume the worrrst. If I can't find them, no one can.
6836 : Why must Humes and Galka be so irresponsible!? It is their fault for wandering off without telling us!
6837 : There are too few of us left to continue. I say we go back. Besides, we would find nothing even if we stayed.
6838 : I second that. I've had enough of this crrreepy place anyway.
6839 : B-but, there are still places we haven't looked--
6840 : We have seen enough. There is nothing here but dust and ruins.
6841 : We accomplished nothing but losing two members of our party and wasting an extraordinary amount of time...
6842 : Yeah, you're right. This whole expedition was a failure. Let's head back tomorrow.
6843 : Ulrich. Tell me something... Was it really an accident?
6844 : What do you mean?
6845 : Is it not true that there is some...shall we say, tension, between Humes and Galka in Bastok these days?
6846 : Are you accusing me of something, Elvaan?
6847 : Hah! Calm down. I do not care if it was an accident or not. I care even less about your little country's problems.
6848 : Just...do not cause any more trouble with such trivial matters while I am around. That is all.
6849 : ...
6850 : It is quite late to be up and about, Sir Francmage. Is something wrong?
6851 : Ah, Courisaille. It's nothing. I could not sleep, so I decided to take a walk. Leave me; I am fine.
6852 : Yes, sir.
6853 : No! Not you...? Raogrimm? What do you mean!? He died in an accident! I know nothing!
6854 : Sir Francmage? Are you all right, sir?
6855 : Stop! Do not come any further! No, nooo--
6856 : ... S-Sir...Francmage?

6887 : Assignments, or hunts, can be undertaken simply by selecting the name of a monster listed in the registry.
6888 : Pertinent information such as monster elusiveness and ferocity has been recorded for your reference. As safety cannot be guaranteed, we ask that you hunt within your ability.
6889 : Hunts pit you against creatures of extreme ferocity, and are not intended for training. For this reason, you cannot undertake a hunt while a training regime is active.
6890 : Should party members undertaking a common hunt defeat the objective, the kill will be considered valid for all.
6891 : Upon the completion of a hunt, record your success in a hunt registry. Doing so will earn you rewards corresponding to difficulty as well as scylds--tokens of your valor.

10001 : But it's too bad; the ambassador's out right now.
10002 : You've heard of Delkfutt's Tower, have you not? The ambassador is presently inspecting that area. Her Excellency is scheduled to return soon, however.
10003 : You know where Delkfutt's Tower is, right? The ambassador's out investigating the area, but I think he's coming back soon.

10018 : The ambassador has a rare affliction, and it's time for a checkup.
10019 : I say this to you as a friend... Keep a safe distance from foreign dignitaries.
10020 : I've told you before that diseases know no borders. Every patient needs a doctor; nationality and status matter not.
10021 : Hmph. You haven't changed a bit, have you? You should take special care, my friend, lest you come to regret it.
10022 : Advise your ambassador against these careless adventures. I shall return later. Good day.
10023 : Hmm...
10024 : Well, I can't give checkups without a patient. Please convey how sorry I was to miss the ambassador, and that I'll call again later.
10025 : Sir Wolfgang is the captain of the guard for Archduke Kam'lanaut. But I wonder what business he had with Her Excellency...
10026 : Wolfgang's the captain of the guard for Archduke Kam'lanaut. Say, I wonder what he wanted with His Excellency...
10027 : Wolfgang is the captain of the guard of Archduke Kam'lanaut. I wish I knew what he wanted with His Excellency, though...
10028 : Ah, but it is a good thing you are here! Why don't you go to Delkfutt's Tower and report on the ambassador's progress? A fitting task for the newcomer!

10030 : Of course! Why don't you go to Delkfutt's Tower and see how he's doing? I know you just got here, but thanks!
10031 : Tread lightly, as the place is crawling with fiends. It would behoove you to purchase arms in town, and to travel in the company of fellow adventurers.
10032 : I hear that place is crawling with fiends! Be sure to gear up in town. And don't even think of going solo, either.
10033 : We've heard that place houses fiends of foul stench! Stock up on new equipment in town, and make sure you've got a party to watch your back.
10034 : Of course, you were promoted for a reason, so I have the utmost faith in your success. Best of luck to you!
10035 : I know you've served your country well, so I'm confident you'll do fine. Go get 'em, soldier!
10036 : You've come this far, so I'm sure you'll do fine. Good luck!

10038 : Foul beasts lurk around every corner. Be on your guard.
10039 : Delkfutt's Tower is on the island of Qufim. Scour the town for deals on gear, and remember that there's safety in numbers.
10040 : That place is full of monsters, so watch your back[, jack./.]
10041 : Delkfutt's Tower is on the island of Qufim. Don't forget to shop for upgrades. And get some help to tag along... You'll need it!

10062 : You know, there's a certain special task you may be interested in later. Now is not the time, but I'll keep you in mind.

10089 : Your deeds will shine upon us all!
10090 : That's the spirit!
10091 : Spoken like a true Windurstian!
10092 : Either way, you must present yourself to the archduke as a new member of the San d'Orian diplomatic mission. It is always darkest before dawn, as they say.
10093 : Don't stress over it. All new diplomatic personnel have to report to the archduke anyway. It's always darkest before the dawn, as they say.
10094 : Hey, don't worry! All new diplomatic staff have to present themselves to the archduke anyway. It's always darkest before the dawn, say the wise men.
10095 : This is your %.
10096 : You already have %? Well, I guess there is no need to issue a new one.
10097 : Here's %.
10098 : You already have %? Well, I guess we don't have to issue you a new one, then.
10099 : Here is your %.
10100 : You already have %? Well, I guess there is no need to issue you a new one.
10101 : Our friendship with the Jeunoans rests upon your shoulders. Luck be with you!
10102 : Our reputation with Jeuno depends on you. Don't let us down.
10103 : This mission is critical to our friendship with the Jeunoans. May the stars watch over you!
10104 : Our prayers are with you. Now, make haste to the archduke's palace!
10105 : We believe in you, %. Now, seek audience with the archduke!
10106 : Go, and the winds of fortune will follow you. You mustn't keep the archduke waiting!
10107 : It reads, Restricted Area.
10108 : You have no letter of introduction.
10109 : The consulate is away.
10110 : You do not have a permit to see the archduke.
10111 : So, you're the new attach.
10112 : I am Kam'lanaut, Archduke of Jeuno. I'd like your nation's help with a certain matter.
10113 : Oh, a visitor?
10114 : Hello there. My name's Eald'narche. Pleased to meet ya.
10115 : This is my brother. Don't let him bother you.
10116 : Now, let us get down to business. I summoned you here for a certain mission. Have you heard word of the Shadow Lord?
10117 : My sources tell me that beastmen in Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja are conspiring to return him to Vana'diel.
10118 : They seek to do so by harnessing the power of mysterious stones called magicite.
10119 : To stop their nefarious plan, I want you to go to those three places and seize that magicite.
10120 : Of course, I intend to reward you for a task of this magnitude. I will issue % upon receipt of the three magicite.
10121 : With it, you can swiftly travel home, or to any civilized land, for that matter.
10122 : So they're after magicite, are they? I wonder what this means... Take extra special care. The thought of a world under the control of the beastmen makes me shudder.
10123 : I bet the beastmen have traps waiting. First, you've got to find out as much as you can.
10124 : Eald'narche speaks the truth. Start by finding out what you can in town. I'm counting on you!
10125 : A moment, please.
10126 : By the order of His Grace, we have decided to seek the assistance of the Tenshodo, the organization run by that Aldo fellow.
10127 : This secret dispatch outlines our wishes. Would you be so kind as to deliver it to him?
10128 : He is a man of many talents. It would be wise to seek his acquaintance. Good luck!
10129 : Excellent work. How fares the archduke?
10130 : He wants you to gather the magicite? I know nothing about objects of lore, but perhaps you should try learning more about Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja.
10131 : At ease, soldier. So, how was the archduke?
10132 : He wants you to gather magicite? That kind of thing is far beyond my expertise, so you should scour the land for clues on Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja.
10133 : So, you saw the archduke... Well, how did it go?
10134 : He wants you to gather magicite? I can't offer any advice on those. Maybe you can try learning about Davoi, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja...
10135 : Magicite! Yes, these stones emit the same power as crystals. Though impure, that power is great indeed.
10136 : Now it is clear why the beastmen gathered where they did. They were drawn to the magicite's great power!
10137 : Yes, it is time to eradicate the beastman threat once and for all.
10138 : I thank you for your service. Here is %. With it, you may travel to any nation you please.
10139 : For now, I thank you for your service. Since you already have %, please accept this instead. May you spend it wisely.
10140 : The three stones are incomplete, but with the powers of the fourth stone that rests deep beneath Castle Zvahl...
10141 : Perhaps then the Shadow Lord will rise again.
10142 : Of course, the talisman that seals Zvahl's inner depths was put in place over twenty years ago. It would stop any attempt.
10143 : I've also read that the three keys to open the seal were kept safely by the three great nations...
10144 : Your Grace!
10145 : What is it?
10146 : Dire news, Your Grace! The leaders of all three nations have been attacked!
10147 : Attacked... By beastmen?
10148 : Yes, Your Grace.
10149 : Confound them! They're one step ahead of us.
10150 : So, they seek to resurrect the Shadow Lord... Quite a lofty goal for beastmen.
10151 : So be it, then. Perhaps you should return to your embassy.
10152 : I will call for your aid again soon. Until then, be well.
10153 : Hey, what's going on? Oh, you don't have to tell me.
10154 : Oh, so you went to Castle Oztroja and met a girl named Verena there.
10155 : And she gets along with the beastmen. Wow, so maybe we could get along.
10156 : Hey, Wolfgang! Wolfie, you here?
10157 : What would you ask of me, Lord Eald'narche?
10158 : Could you find someone named Verena and bring her here? I heard she's Aldo's little sister.
10159 : Of course, my lord. But may I ask why? She seems of...questionable intentions.
10160 : I think she has some nifty powers, so I just want to play with her. That's all.
10161 : Oh, and don't tell this to Kam'lanaut. I want to surprise him.
10162 : As you wish, my lord.
10163 : Heh. I can't wait!
10164 : %! At long last you return! Congratulations on your success!
10165 : I regret you have no time for reprieve. Our beloved San d'Oria is in danger!
10166 : Her Excellency is away, so please take this to the court in her stead. Take the airship! I will remain and do what I can.
10167 : Make haste to San d'Oria! You can board the airship now, can you not? I will remain here and find out what I can.
10168 : Well, I am relieved there was no danger. Our embassy is safe as well. For now, obey the court's commands.
10169 : %! You made it back in one piece!
10170 : No time for R&R, soldier! Your country needs you!
10171 : The ambassador's away, so you'll have to carry this back to the administration. Take the airship! I'll stay here to get to the bottom of this.
10172 : Get on that airship to Bastok, soldier! I'll stay here and find out what I can.
10173 : So, it's business as usual in Bastok, huh? Well, we have nothing special for you here, so try following the administration's directives.
10174 : There you are! Great work, %!
10175 : I'm sorry, but you've got no time to rest! Our beloved Windurst is in grave danger!
10176 : With the ambassador away, I want you to take this back to the motherland. Take the airship; it's faster. I'll find out what I can here.
10177 : Hurry-scurry! Take the airship back to Windurst! I'll find out what I can here.
10178 : As long as the Star Sibyl is safe, then all is well. We don't have any tasks for you here, so continue your service to your country.
10179 : You don't have %.
10180 : Nobody sees the sovereign without an appointment!
10181 : Stand down!
10182 : Just a moment. I need to see your %...
10183 : Thank you. If the sovereign requests your audience, access to the chamber will be granted by the guards inside.
10184 : I'm sorry, but you will need % to get in.
10185 : This the hall of the Ducal Guards. Only the finest warriors may join. Come to think of it, this is no place for civilians like you.
10186 : Sir Wolfgang is our leader. He was selected not just for his skill at arms, but also for his unwavering determination.
10187 : Who are you and what's your business!? Oh, you're an attach... My apologies! I have to check everyone who passes through here.
10188 : In this job, I assume everyone's guilty until proven innocent. I meant no offense.
10189 : Welcome. This is the home of the archduke, so please conduct yourself accordingly.
10190 : Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche rarely make public appearances.
10191 : And you need a special permit just to have an audience with them.
10192 : Both have kept their youth through all these years. Perhaps some otherworldly power watches over them. Great prophets like them are few indeed!
10193 : Say... You know Aldo, the guy who runs the organization called the Tenshodo?
10194 : Do you know him? Yes. No.
10195 : The Tenshodo was founded by Aldo's father. They've done so well in trading abroad that they own the black market in these parts. Er, so I've heard...
10196 : Aldo took over after his father died. I've heard all kinds of things about him, but they say he's a smart and honorable man.
10197 : Oh, you're a Tenshodo member? I guess you know more than I do, then.
10198 : You should do business with the Tenshodo, too. They supply us with hard-to-find goods now and then.
10199 : Beyond us stands the peace monument, constructed after the war. The embassies were built around it.
10200 : Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche designed these gardens of Ru'Lude. One look is enough to see how much they treasure peace.
10201 : These grounds are the domain of Lords Kam'lanaut and Eald'narche. Please conduct yourself properly.
10202 : Have you ever met Lord Eald'narche? He's still a lad, but the archduke's brother is gifted with incredible talents.
10203 : Jeuno is safe as long as it has Archduke Kam'lanaut and Lord Eald'narche.
10204 : The three great nations preach friendship, but beneath the facade is a struggle for supremacy. Nobody can tell what will come of it.
10205 : That is why we must focus on our duties. There is no guarantee that the reign of peace we enjoy now will last.
10206 : Did you know that Lord Eald'narche wears an eye patch? He had an accident when he was little, but it hasn't fazed him! Bless his heart.
10207 : In the chaos of war, the archduke had a brilliant plan. He believed that the three nations' only chance was to cast aside their squabbles and stand as one.
10208 : Each nation had to shoulder an equal burden in the struggle against the beastmen. His strategy was truly brilliant!
10209 : Without his guidance, this world would have turned to shadow under the domination of the beastmen.
10210 : In the past, there was a terrible war. My father once told me how the earth, swept by furious winds, was soaked in the blood of the fallen.
10211 : I heard his tales every time he drowned his sorrows in drink. Now his stories are etched in my mind.
10212 : Sir Wolfgang's father was a famous soldier, too. He commanded Jeuno's forces in the Crystal War, and his exploits are legendary.
10213 : After the war, he looked after the families of his fallen comrades. What a great man... There's more to being a soldier than just brute strength!
10214 : Sometimes I see the darndest things here. One time, a rookie of ours got cursed in the necropolis of Eldieme, and I didn't know what to do.
10215 : I bet things are brewing that are way too crazy for us to imagine.
10216 : Once I took a new guy to the Eldieme Necropolis, and he got cursed there. He went berserk, and had this unstoppable craving for raw meat.
10217 : Well, I gave it some thought... And you know those torches in the rooms made of stone? Well, I heard that spirits hate them...
10218 : So, I figured it might help if I lit a lantern with those flames and brought it here. That's how we saved the guy.
10219 : But, uh... I've also heard that some spirits actually like that kind of fire. So, it might not always be such a good idea.
10220 : I guess we were lucky then. We had no idea what else to do, and just wanted to do what we could.
10221 : If you want, we can lend you the lantern we used back then. What do you say?
10222 : Do you want to borrow the lantern? Yes, please. Not now.
10223 : Try and bring back the flames in this lantern. We don't know what else could help.
10224 : I seem to remember there were four torches, and that you had to light them in the proper order.
10225 : Yeah, that's right. I remember screwing that up. Too bad I forgot the real order, though. Well, I'm sure you can figure it out.
10226 : Don't forget it's the stone-wrought room that you're after. The torches in the caverns are for something else, so don't mix them up.
10227 : Oh, yeah? Well, you're free to use it any time.
10228 : If you knew exactly which spirit is doing the possessing, then you can figure out how to exorcise it. But that's the last resort, you know?
10229 : Oh, the flame thing didn't work, huh? Well, I'm just glad the spirit's gone!
10230 : Yep, I knew it. You learn something every day. I'm gonna write this up in the Guardsman's Daily.
10231 : I always wondered how someone of his height lit that lantern.
10232 : The archduke hosts so many dignitaries, every night is a banquet. Composing original menus makes me fret!
10233 : This is the archduke's chamber. Only here can he find refuge from his busy schedule...
10234 : But he's always out, doing his best for the Duchy. We all look up to him so much. His deeds benefit not only Jeuno, but the entire world as well.
10235 : All I can do in return is change his sheets and prepare hot soup.
10236 : These works are part of Lord Eald'narche's collection. His Lordship is versed in history as well as art.
10237 : The archduke and his brother often relax in this room. We always wait outside, but they do seem to get along quite well.
10238 : I do not pry into their conversations, but their knowledge of politics, culture, and philosophy rivals that of scholars.
10239 : Our job is to confront anyone suspicious. Why, if anything happened to the archduke, the repercussions would be felt around the world.
10240 : This monument was built at the end of the war...as a reminder that nobody should suffer like that ever again.
10241 : And now, people forget the mistakes of the past and quarrel all over again. I bet this is the only place where that promise is still remembered.
10242 : I want somebody to take this map I got in the north and stave off impending disaster, but you don't look ready for such a task.
10243 : Maybe you can take this % I got in the north, and stave off impending disaster... Do you think you've got what it takes?
10244 : What do you say? I can do it. Not now.
10245 : I knew you were the one! Now bring me % and show me what you're made of!
10246 : Well, that's a bummer. I thought you just might be the one!
10247 : Bring me %. I'm counting on you!
10248 : Good job! I knew you could do it. But be on your guard.
10249 : Don't forget our vow here. Remember how precious peace is.
10250 : Mmm? You've already got one. Well, that's great--think of it as a farewell present.
10251 : Good luck with the petition!
10252 : Well, if they can tear down the clock tower, who knows what they'll do to the monument? Quick, where do I sign?
10253 : Oh, dear... Did you lose your way? I didn't call for a cub like you.
10254 : Well, well, well... You might have what it takes. Hear me out. You've got nothing to lose.
10255 : Hear me out, okay? All right. No, thanks.
10256 : Oh, what a pity. Goodbye.
10257 : All right, look. The archduke's running low on food and gifts for all the foreign bigwigs he entertains.
10258 : Don't you think something weird's going on? I mean, ambassadors from the three nations stop by all the time, and the train of delegates and caravans never stops.
10259 : The reward is really something. It's a key the archduke himself found in the ruins. They say it makes things...automatically. Well? Wanna try it?
10260 : Wanna try it? Yes. No.
10261 : Guess I was wrong about you. Bye.
10262 : Oh, now you're talkin'. First, pick out what you're going to collect from this list here.
10263 : What to collect? Accessories. Fine Seafood. Rare Herbs & Vegetables. Luxury Weapons and Armor. Exquisite Dishes. Exotic Medicines. Magical Instruments. Expensive Jewels. Quit.
10264 : Okay, so you're going to have to collect %, %, %, and %.
10265 : Your reward will be %. Wanna see the others?
10266 : Do you want to see the others? You bet. Not now.
10267 : Okay. So, good luck! You can only have one chip for each element. They break when you use them, so come back if you want more.
10268 : What, you don't want to do it? All right. Just pick from this list, then.
10269 : Okey-dokey. Not too shabby. This is for you!
10270 : I don't know the details, but you're supposed to take it to the ruins underground and put some mineral called ada-something in it. Well, come back anytime!
10271 : Now offering quick and easy delivery of packages to homes everywhere!
10272 : Would you care to see a map of Greater Jeuno?
10273 : What do you say? Show me. Not now.
10274 : We stand in the gardens of Ru'Lude, at the very top of Jeuno's superstructure.
10275 : A mighty fine palace, this is. Why, it's like a castle in the clouds! I'm so glad I came all this way to see it.
10276 : Oh, now where'd the wife head off to? I suppose she'll show up if I stay put here.
10277 : I get the creeps looking down from the edge. It really hits you how high up we are.
10278 : I wonder how they managed to build this place? Jeuno's full of mysteries, like the airships! But the biggest one of all is the archduke. Nobody knows who he is or where he's from.
10279 : I hate you all!
10280 : A classmate of mine always used to yell that whenever he climbed tall places. I wonder what he was trying to say?
10281 : My husband's wandered off somewhere. Ru'Lude is so big, I'd better just wait for him here.
10282 : You can set this as your current home point. Once you set a home point, you will return there whenever you are incapacitated.
10283 : Set this as current home point? Yes. No.
10284 : Home point set!
10285 : A home point can be set as a spot for you to return to Vana'diel when you have been knocked out. You can also use a home point to teleport to other home points.
10286 : What will you do? Travel to another home point. Set this as your home point. Other settings. On second thought, never mind.
10287 : You have registered a new home point! You are now able to teleport here from any other home point.
10288 : You may teleport from here to any other home point you have registered.

10304 : Welcome to the auction house. Do you have any questions about our establishment?
10305 : What do you want to know? What is the auction house? How are auctions run? Are there any fees? Are there any limits? How do you check up on merchandise? How do you remove an item? My Sales Status list is full! Nothing right now.
10306 : Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.
10307 : Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.
10308 : Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.
10309 : The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.
10310 : Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).
10311 : If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.
10312 : Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.
10313 : A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.
10314 : The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.
10315 : However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.
10316 : A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.
10317 : Once an item appears on your Sales Status list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.
10318 : If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select Stop Sale from the Sales Status menu.
10319 : To remove an item from your Sales Status list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.
10320 : Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.
10321 : At any auction counter, open the Sales Status menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.
10322 : Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).
10323 : Is there anything else you would like to know?
10324 : In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!
10325 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
10326 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
10327 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
10328 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
10336 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
10337 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
10338 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
10339 : Oh, what a cruel, cruel master, kupo!!!
10340 : Thank you, kupo! I...have one more favor to ask. It's almost time for the festival in the moogles' hometown, kupo!
10341 : Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him % as a gift, kupo!
10342 : Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and % would make the perfect present, kupo!
10343 : But I have no idea how to go about finding % or %, kupo... I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...
10344 : Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him % as a gift, kupo!
10345 : Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and % would make the perfect present, kupo!
10346 : But I have no idea how to go about finding % or %, kupo... I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...
10347 : Master! I'm overwhelmed by your kindness, kupo!!!
10348 : I'll bring you a nice present from the moogles' hometown, kupo! I'll be back in a few days, kupo!
10349 : Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
10350 : Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!
10351 : Looking at that shabby old bed makes me feel homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
10352 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
10353 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
10354 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
10355 : Thank you, kupo! I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!
10356 : Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
10357 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!
10358 : But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
10359 : Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
10360 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!
10361 : But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
10362 : Master! I'm overwhelmed by your kindness, kupo!!!
10363 : I'll bring you a nice present from the moogles' hometown, kupo! I'll be back in a few days, kupo!
10364 : Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
10365 : Here's your present--the behemoth of Mog Safes, kupo! Now you can store as many as 70 items, kupo!
10366 : The capacity of your Mog Safe has increased!
10367 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
10368 : After resting on the %, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?
10369 : Give your moogle some time off? Have fun, kupo! No, I am your only friend now!
10370 : Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!
10371 : The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take % for my friends there, kupo!
10372 : And my other buddies need % for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!
10373 : I can't help out my friends if I don't have % and %, kupo...
10374 : I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!
10375 : Master! I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!
10376 : We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!
10377 : Heh. You've got no business talking to me. Why, you're just a pup.
10378 : Well, well... You've come quite far, but you've still got a long way to go. Do you know about the people here?
10379 : Well, don't take this personally, but to them, you're just a tiny little bug! And I'm the one who trains them. Yeah, you can call me a teacher.
10380 : I'm sure you've ambitions of your own, right? If you want to break the barriers within you, you'll have to pass my test. What do you say?
10381 : Accept the challenge? At once! No, thanks.
10382 : Very good. Gather these:
10383 : %, %, and %. Well, get to it!
10384 : Yes, that might be prudent. But you'll never move into the next gear with that kind of attitude!
10385 : Well, did you find them? Here's what I need:
10386 : This is good, very good! Today you've taken your first step into a broader world!
10387 : What, you don't understand? Just get out there and fight. Then you'll see!
10388 : Your level limit is now 55.
10389 : How's it feel at the top, [sonny/kiddo]? Well, you ain't even close yet. You're just gettin' started!
10390 : You think you had a hard time with that last quest? Well, when I was your age, I had to gather twice as many items in half the time! So, stop complainin'!
10391 : Do you think you've got what it takes to take the next step? Don't think I'm forcing you, or anything!
10392 : Accept the challenge? Of course! No, not yet.
10393 : Good answer! I'm proud to have a pupil like you! Anyway, listen close to what I have to say.
10394 : Many caverns to the north are home to fiends that can find you even when you're invisible. Bring me three samples of frigicite from deep within.
10395 : This time, it's a test of wits. Barrier-breakers need brains, after all. Well, get going!
10396 : Oh? Very well. It's your life.
10397 : Many caverns to the north house fiends that can see the unseen. Visit them and bring me three samples of frigicite.
10398 : Yes, the very thing! You've crossed another great threshold today! Of course, this is merely a prologue of things to come!
10399 : The ultimate barrier is still far away. Don't worry about it. What matters is effort!
10400 : Your level limit is now 60.
10401 : So you think you're ready for the next challenge?
10402 : Do you think you can handle it? Of course! Not just yet.
10403 : That's the spirit. You'll never get anything in this world unless you really want it.
10404 : %, %, and %. Bring these three items here to me.
10405 : I know you can do it. There's something different about you. I can feel it in my bones!
10406 : Well, the choice is yours. I won't goad you into anything.
10407 : %, %, and %. Bring those three items here to me.
10408 : I knew you could do it! I believed in you all along.
10409 : Your level limit is now 65.
10410 : I see you're becoming stronger by the day. Maybe you're ready for my next test. How about it?
10411 : Your next test will span over the farthest reaches of Vana'diel. You'll have to give it your all, or you're sure to fail.
10412 : Now listen carefully. First, you must get your hands on four %. I'm going to give you four hints. You have to figure out who I am talking about, and give one of those % to each of them.
10413 : I've already talked to them, so all you have to do is hand over the % and they will trade you back a strange stone.
10414 : If the person you try to trade it to doesn't accept it, then it means you've got the wrong person.
10415 : Here are your four hints, so listen up. I want you to find these people...
10416 : #. A boy who only thinks of his sick mother.

10448 : Think hard. You'll figure out who I'm talking about.
10449 : What? You need the hints again? Listen up, then. I want you to find these people...
10450 : Excellent job! Remember, adventuring is not all just about battles and monsters, but about the people you meet along the way. Try not to forget those faces.
10451 : Your level limit is now 70.
10452 : Hm? I don't have time to play with half-grown puppies. Why don't you head back to your Mog House and come see me when you're more prepared.
10453 : You've been whisked off to zone #!
10454 : It's been a long road to the top, and I'm sure you've had your share of hard times along the way.
10455 : I want you to remember back to the very first day you stepped out into the Vana'diel sun. You were still a tiny ant trying to climb a mountain... But now look at you--riding the clouds to the stars.
10456 : But don't think that you've reached the top. Even if you break one limit, there's always another waiting for you. But it's our persistent aiming for the top that makes us great.
10457 : However, I'm growing old, and there's not much left to teach you. Our tale together has reached its final chapter, so to speak.
10458 : But before we turn the page, I'll need you to bring me %. What's that look on your face? Rounding up something like that should be no problem for a [guy/lady] like you!
10459 : Master Maat!
10460 : Wh-wh-what in...!? Oh, it's you, Wolfgang. I wish you'd stop sneaking up on me like that. It's bad for my heart!
10461 : It is time, sir.
10462 : Oh, yes. Of course.
10463 : Sir, you are not still bothering adventurers with your games, are you?
10464 : Games? You should talk, Wolfgang. Why, % here could slice you up and eat you for breakfast.
10465 : Yes, sir... Now, we must be off. I will meet you at the gate when you arrive.
10466 : I'm sorry about the interruption. Anyway, you go get me that %. While you're doing that, I'll finish my business with Wolfgang.
10467 : Find me % and bring it back here. Then we can see what the final chapter holds for you.
10468 : That wasn't so hard now, was it?
10469 : I bet you're wondering why I keep having you travel around the globe, collecting all these rare and obscure items for me.
10470 : Heh heh heh. I know what you're thinking. You're sick and tired of playing fetch for old Maat. You want a chance to show me what you're really made of.
10471 : Well, now that you mention it, I think I'd be delighted to test your might with my own hands.
10472 : I may look old, but I still have a lot of spunk in me. I can take anything and everything you've got.
10473 : What do you say? You'll get your chance to get back at me for all the trouble I've put you through, and I'll get some good exercise.
10474 : Challenge Maat? You bet! I'm not ready to hit the mat.
10475 : Heh heh heh! That's the spirit! Now take that % to the burning circle and throw it in. I'll be waiting for you inside.
10476 : Huh? You're not afraid of an old man now, are you? Well, I guess I can give you a little more time to prepare. You can call it a handicap. Heh heh heh.
10477 : So, are you ready to take me on?
10478 : Hey, that % you've got there is a piece of junk. You'll need a new one if you want to fight me.
10479 : Let's see... How about we duel it out [ /at Horlais Peak/at Balga's Dais/at Balga's Dais/at Horlais Peak/in the Waughroon Shrine/in the Waughroon Shrine/at the Qu'Bia Arena/at the Qu'Bia Arena/in the Waughroon Shrine/at the Qu'Bia Arena/at Horlais Peak/in the Chamber of Oracles/in the Chamber of Oracles/in the Chamber of Oracles/at Balga's Dais]? You know what to do with the % when you get there, right?
10480 : Now if you show me that %, I'll even teleport you to the battlefield. Boy, are we going to have some fun!
10481 : I have to admit, that was one fine display of fighting, %.
10482 : It's kind of hard to believe, but did you know that Jeuno was once a run-down, tiny little fishing village?
10483 : Now look at her... There isn't a soul in Vana'diel who doesn't know her beauty. Let me tell you a story...
10484 : Long ago, there was a young man--captain of a fishing boat, he was--who lived a modest life in the peaceful harbors of Jeuno. It was often hard for him to make ends meet, but he and his fishing buddies had no complaints. They loved their tiny village...
10485 : However, one stormy night, fate came knocking at his door when he rescued two strange lads from the nearby waters. From that day on, the wheels of change began to turn.
10486 : There was something different--something special--about those two. They possessed a great deal of knowledge and leadership, and in just a short period of time, they transformed Jeuno from an insignificant dot on the map into a giant metropolis.
10487 : At first, the captain welcomed these changes with open arms. However, later he began to ask himself if all this was truly for the good of Jeuno, or if the city was just being used as a piece of some bigger plan put into motion by the two mysterious men...
10488 : But by then it was too late... Jeuno and the people living within her walls had changed... There was no turning back.
10489 : And so the captain decided: While he still had life inside his bones, he would make it his mission to remain and watch over his hometown.
10490 : Good day, Maat.
10491 : Oh, if it isn't Doctor Monberaux.
10492 : You are looking quite healthy these days, old chap.
10493 : As healthy as a Hobgoblin, thanks to your treatment. You sure know how to keep your patients happy, heh heh heh.
10494 : Ha ha. I'm just doing my job.
10495 : By the way...
10496 : Hm?
10497 : You mentioned this captain watching over Jeuno. What exactly was he making sure of?
10498 : Hmmm... Well, he was probably just making sure that everybody was happy.
10499 : You know, I think you are probably right.
10500 : There are many things out there that threaten the happiness of all Jeunoans, and he couldn't stand to sit back and watch that happiness be snatched away from them.
10501 : Maat...
10502 : Ahem. Ah, will you look at the time. I must be getting back to the infirmary. Take care, my friend.
10503 : Don't you worry, doctor. I always do. Oh, and you keep working on Wolfgang. Once he sees what's really going on in this place, he'll start to change. I know it...
10504 : As do I...
10505 : Now, where was I...
10506 : As much as I long to see it, it's likely I won't be around when the truth finally comes out. But young adventurers like you will. That's why I want you to be all that you can be.
10507 : Do not forget the hardships you have endured to make it this far, and maybe one day you, too, will find something worth giving your life to protect.
10508 : They say that where there is a beginning, there is an end. However, I believe that some things, like memories, don't have to end. That is where you young folk come in...
10509 : And that is all this simple old man can ask for...
10510 : Your level limit is now 75.
10511 : Now that you've reached the stars, there's nothing left that I can do for you. Unless you'd like to go another round with a frail old man. If you're up to it, that is...
10512 : When you're ready, I'll be waiting for you [ /at Horlais Peak/at Balga's Dais/at Balga's Dais/at Horlais Peak/in the Waughroon Shrine/in the Waughroon Shrine/at the Qu'Bia Arena/at the Qu'Bia Arena/in the Waughroon Shrine/at the Qu'Bia Arena/at Horlais Peak/in the Chamber of Oracles/in the Chamber of Oracles/in the Chamber of Oracles/at Balga's Dais]. Oh, and don't forget to bring along %.
10513 : But just because I'm old doesn't mean I'm not a busy man. I don't need any half-hearted whippersnappers banging on my door, just to run off with their tails between their legs. If you want some thrill in your life, you had better be ready for the consequences! Heh heh heh!
10514 : Heh heh heh. I see, I see... That just might work, kupo...
10515 : Ahem! Too much time around these crazy moogles and I just might turn into one!

10539 : Ah, standing here in Jeuno brings back memories...
10540 : Twenty years ago, I worked in this very town with scientists from all over the world. We were trying to solve the hunger problem that plagued Vana'diel.
10541 : What? You want to hear about what happened twenty years ago?
10542 : Twenty years ago, I worked in this very town with scientists from all over the world. We were trying to solve the hunger problem that plagued Vana'diel.
10543 : Koru-Moru! Now that's a name that brings back memories.
10544 : People say that we scientists are a strange bunch, but Koru-Moru...now he was a crazy one.
10545 : But even a weird one like him had a girl he loved. I'll never forget seeing him and Rasusu...
10546 : You say you're looking for Rasusu? Now why would a young [lad/lass] like yourself want to do that?
10547 : I see. Koru-Moru's finally started to remember... Well, that's one box of memories that should remain shut.
10548 : If you promise to keep quiet on the subject, I'll tell you what I know.
10549 : Twenty years ago, the Rolanberry Fields were rampaged by those dreadful Crawlers. The problem escalated to the point where the people of Jeuno had nothing to put on their dinner tables.
10550 : One adventurer saw the problem that lay before Jeuno and began calling for volunteers to travel to the Crawlers' Nest and exterminate the queen.
10551 : Seeing that her research was going nowhere, Rasusu decided to take her chances and go along with the adventurer.
10552 : I tried to contact Koru-Moru, in hopes that I could get him to persuade Rasusu to stay in Jeuno. But at the same time, Windurst had its own problems, and I couldn't get ahold of him.
10553 : And then she went...and no one ever saw her again.
10554 : After the war ended, I tried writing Koru-Moru many times, but I could never bring myself to tell him the truth about his beloved Rasusu.
10555 : Windurst had been devastated by the Great War, and Koru-Moru had seen the devastation with his own eyes. I could not bear to be the bringer of any more tragic news.
10556 : Knowing Koru-Moru, the memories of Rasusu probably got lost in the back of his tiny little head...
10557 : You know Koru-Moru, so you can understand why I ask you to keep the truth from him--for his sake.
10558 : Twenty years ago, Koru-Moru and Rasusu worked side by side for the good of Vana'diel.
10559 : However, the terrible Crawlers pulled the young lovers apart. A sad, sad story, it is.
10560 : What is this you have found? %? Where did you get that?
10561 : You say that this belonged to Rasusu? Then it is true. The poor soul perished in that infernal place...
10562 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
10563 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
10564 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
10565 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
10566 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
10567 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
10568 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
10569 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
10570 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
10571 : You've earned conquest points!
10572 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
10573 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
10574 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
10575 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
10576 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
10577 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
10578 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
10579 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
10580 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
10581 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
10582 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
10583 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
10584 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
10585 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
10586 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
10587 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
10588 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
10589 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
10590 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
10591 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
10592 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
10593 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
10594 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
10595 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
10596 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
10597 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
10598 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
10599 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
10600 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
10601 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
10602 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
10603 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
10604 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
10605 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
10606 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
10607 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.

10626 : You do not possess the # [conquest point/conquest points] required to fully recharge the %.

10644 : Do you really wish to be teleported? Yes. Teleport with gil. Teleport with conquest points. No.
10645 : Welcome to the border shop! If you trade me unused equipment, I'll add their value to your country's region points!
10646 : It should please you to know that I now also deal in %. Bigger pieces will earn you more points for your nation, and I'll even toss some gil into the equation!

10651 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
10652 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
10653 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
10654 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
10655 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.

10669 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.
10670 : Thanks to you, our nation is now first in the conquest race! Here is a small token of our appreciation.
10671 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
10672 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
10673 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.

10678 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
10679 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.

10683 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]?

10694 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
10695 : You received # conquest points!
10696 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
10697 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
10698 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
10699 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
10700 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
10701 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
10702 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
10703 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
10704 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
10705 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
10706 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
10707 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
10708 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
10709 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
10710 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
10711 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
10712 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
10902 : PAUSE
10904 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
10905 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.
10906 : Now close your eyes...
10907 : I'm just starrrting out, so I don't have much...
10908 : Hello therrre. I worrrk for the M&P Market. I'm still new, so I don't know much about selling stuff...
10909 : Hello therrre, [handsome/cutie]! The M&P Market has a lot of useful items, just for you!
10910 : Hello therrre, [sir/ma'am]! Business is booming! The M&P Market even made me managerrr of this local shop!
10911 : My new shipment has finally come in. Talk to me, and I can show you what we have!
10912 : Thanks to you, I've made over # gil! Wait time is #!
10913 : Welcome!
10914 : Hello therrre. I work for the Buffalo Bonanza Ranch. I'm still new, so I don't know much about selling stuff...
10915 : Hello therrre, [handsome/cutie]! The Buffalo Bonanza Ranch has a lot of useful items, just for you!
10916 : Hello therrre, [sir/ma'am]! Business is booming! The Buffalo Bonanza Ranch even made me managerrr of this local shop!
10917 : My new shipment has finally come in. Talk to me, and I can show you what we have!
10918 : Thanks to you, I've made over # gil! Wait time is #!
10919 : Here's a little something for you!
10920 : Welcome! If you have a cowbell, you can receive all of our wares at once!
10921 : So that's what magicite looks like.
10922 : What could they possibly want with it?
10923 : What the...?
10924 : You are too late. I have awoken.
10925 : Your rage, cowardice, envy, arrogance, and apathy... From these I will spread the bane of Vana'diel.
10926 : Who are you!?
10927 : Your kind has awoken me...and this time, you will be destroyed!
10928 : You cannot stop me. Vana'diel will be a grave for you and all your kind!
10929 : The Shadow Lord? It can't be! His powers have returned!
10930 : Then it is true! The beastmen are trying to resurrect the Shadow Lord.
10931 : Those explosives--pretty amazing, aren't they?
10932 : Indeed. Without them, we would not have been able to dig that mine. Now, finally, we can compete with San d'Oria for power.
10933 : Heh, Quadav aren't good enough to live in there! One blast should take care of them...
10934 : ...
10935 : What is the matter, Babenn?
10936 : Lord Raogrimm... We've found the Quadav temple in the mines, as you suspected. I-I could not stop them.
10937 : That is unfortunate... As always, they don't even try to understand.
10938 : Huh. Nothing. With all the Quadav guarding the place, you think we'd find a treasure or two!
10939 : C'mon, let's move! Let's just finish this job and go.
10940 : Ulrich, wait!
10941 : As I thought...they were trying to protect their eggs...
10942 : But they don't even try to understand...
10943 : Is that all you've got, Raogrimm!?
10944 : Ulrich, why!?
10945 : Why? Because I never liked you, that's why!
10946 : You will never get away with this, Ulrich!
10947 : Watch me!
10948 : ...Cornelia!?
10949 : Wh-what have I done!?
10950 : Why...!?
10951 : I...couldn't let you die here, Raogrimm... There are people who need you...
10952 : Cornelia!!!
10953 : No... NOOOOO!
10954 : Wait for load.
10955 : So, that's what magicite looks like.
10956 : What are they trying to do with it, though?
10957 : !!!
10958 : You are too late... I have already awakened.
10959 : Your rage, cowardice, envy, arrogance, and apathy...from these I will spread the bane that will destroy Vana'diel.
10960 : Who are you!?
10961 : Your kind awakened me...and this time, you will be destroyed!
10962 : You cannot stop me. Vana'diel will be the grave for you and all your kind!
10963 : The Shadow Lord!? It can't be! His powers couldn't have returned!?
10964 : Then it is true. The beastmen are trying to bring back the Shadow Lord.
10965 : ...Be careful.
10966 : What now? (Empty) Event (Empty) Warp Went out of Zone Flag Reset
10967 : Which event? fs001: Been out of zone at least once. Reset quest flags only.
10968 : Well, then. OK Reset quest flags only.
10969 : Warp where? Magicite ???
10970 : Summoning, you say?
10971 : Yes, I would like to name this magic summoning.
10972 : The divine texts depict it in the form of the Star Sibyl commanding a great beast.
10973 : At any rate, we are very close. Soon, the magic of summoning will be complete.
10974 : Hmm...
10975 : Are you uneasy, Your Holiness?
10976 : Yes... Very.
10977 : Time is of the essence. The lines of battle are at Tahrongi Canyon, and draw close to Sarutabaruta.
10978 : The attack on Oztroja shall fail, and many flames of life will be extinguished...like the Star Reading, long ago.
10979 : Place your trust in me, Your Holiness. Windurst shall escape its fate of ruin.
10980 : The Book of the Gods has taught me everything.
10981 : It told me the meaning of the tower and the fountain. And it has taught me how to command the greatest of beasts.
10982 : Stars of the heavens, tell me what to do!
10983 : Tell me, Karaha-Baruha! Help me!
10984 : What happened? Are you all right?
10985 : So, that's what magicite looks like.
10986 : What could they possibly want with it?
10987 : What the...!?
10988 : You are too late... I have already awakened.
10989 : Your anger, cowardice, envy, arrogance, and apathy...from these I will spread the bane that will destroy Vana'diel.
10990 : Who are you!?
10991 : Your kind has awakened me...and this time, you will be destroyed!
10992 : You cannot stop me. Vana'diel will be the grave for you and all your kind!
10993 : Was that a phantom? An image...of the Shadow Lord?
10994 : The Shadow Lord? It can't be! His powers can't have returned!
10995 : Then it is true. The beastmen are trying to bring the Shadow Lord back.
10996 : You be careful, too.
10997 : Shoo! Shoo! Keep your grimy claws off of Windurst Orastery minister, Ajido-Marujido!
10998 : You are a fool for coming here to the throne room...alone.
10999 : You say you are the Windurst Orastery minister, Ajido-Marujido?
11000 : Gawk! Orastery minister? And I am Aviatory minister! How do we know what you speak is not lies? Gawk!
11001 : I should cut you up and send you to Heavens Tower! Gawk! Gawk!
11002 : Kahk! Silence... Our little friend came all the way from Windurst to greet us. Let us hear what he has to say.
11003 : Kahk-ka-ka! You came all this way to ask about the Full Moon Fountain?
11004 : Well, you Tartutaru have probably already realized why the Horutoto Ruins were built and why the Full Moon Fountain exists underneath them.
11005 : Those ruins are evil.
11006 : The towers sponge dry the areas around Sarutabaruta of all their magic.
11007 : You think that we Yagudo are the cause of these wastelands, but you only have yourselves to thank. You--the Tarutaru that activated those towers!
11008 : The towers are all damaged! How do you explain magic still being drained from the plains of Sarutabaruta?
11009 : What about you Yagudo? What are those things that you continue digging? Those stones...maybe they are the cause of all this?
11010 : Kahk-ka-ka...I commend you on your perceptiveness.
11011 : But the reason Sarutabaruta is becoming a wasteland has nothing to do with those stones.
11012 : That night, twenty years ago, when we were defeated by your armies, you made a grave mistake...
11013 : Kahk! Kahk! You still do not understand?
11014 : Make your way deep into the central tower of the Horutoto Ruins. There you will see first hand what the Star Sibyl and those summoners really did.
11015 : The moon and the stars no longer smile upon Windurst. Now, the world shall kneel before the Yagudo!
11016 : The bushin's so old that he's losing his eyesight!?
11017 : <Sigh> Well, it has been thirty years. Just look at me. I'm not as young as I used to be.
11018 : Ah, those were the days...
11019 : What's this? You want to know what would impress the bushin? Hmmm... Well, when I was still his disciple, I once presented him with %.
11020 : He was so pleased that he didn't just let me see the %, he let me try it on! I could feel the weight of the souls of all the bushin that had worn it before me.
11021 : But that weight was too great for me, and ever since that day, I've been striving to improve my skills.
11022 : But even now I don't think I could even grasp that belt with my own hands, let alone tie it around my waist. I still have much to learn...
11023 : ... How many rounds have we gone now, %...?
11024 : I remember every single blow, every tiny shift of your stance. I can't tell you how much I look forward to our little matches, heh heh heh.
11025 : But you know, I never imagined anyone would conquer all the challenges I set before [him/her]. Goes to show that even old Maat can be taught a thing or two!
11026 : Now, I can't let such a great hero go home empty-handed. I've decided to grant you any one wish you ask of me. Don't get too exotic, though. I'm just an old man, not some Far Eastern genie!
11027 : Come on, then. No need to be shy. What's it to be?
11028 : ...! Take off my hat!? Are you sure that's want you want? Not much exciting going on under an old man's cap!
11029 : It's not too late to change your mind, you know.
11030 : There must be something else you want. A lifetime supply of Goblin chocolate? Afternoon tea with Princess Claidie? %, perhaps? Or maybe %?
11031 : No? You've made up your mind, it seems. Young people these days--no imagination.
11032 : But if that's what you really want, it makes things easy for me, I suppose. I'll give you one last chance to change your wish...
11033 : Well, alrighty then.
11034 : Are you ready?
11035 : Try not to blink...
11036 : Heh heh heh. Are you happy now? Bet you're thinking you should've changed your mind when you had the chance, huh?
11037 : Aw, don't look so disappointed, %. You think I'd let you walk away with nothing but an eyeful of my wrinkled noggin?
11038 : Even the mightiest oak will wither with the passing of time. Its vibrant leaves will fade to brown, and crumble into dust. I, too, will one day have to leave this garden behind for good.
11039 : Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
11040 : When that time comes, I want you to take up this cap and become the mighty oak. Watch over the saplings as they reach towards the sky. I know you're up to the task, %.
11041 : Do I have your word?
11042 : Well, that takes a load off my mind.
11043 : I've got plenty of spark left in me, though, so don't go getting ahead of yourself! I'll be around whenever you're ready for another bout. Heh heh heh!
11044 : No one is allowed to meet with the archduke or the ducal scientists unless it absolutely necessary.
11045 : The officials have been extremely busy making arrangements for numerous expeditionary forces to be sent to various locations around Quon and Mindartia.
11046 : If you have any business with the archduke or the ducal scientists, please leave your message with us and we will relay it to the proper authorities.
11047 : However, we cannot guarantee that you will receive a hasty reply.
11048 : There is a man from the Alchemists' Guild who has been waiting to speak with the scientists for a number of days.
11049 : I believe he is still waiting somewhere near the archduke's quarters. Pour soul...
11050 : Did you hear? Some of the Telepoint crystals in Holla, Mea, and Dem have broken into a million pieces!
11051 : So that's why Captain Wolfgang has been on edge lately... But what is really going on at those crags?
11052 : I see you have begun to show some interest in the strange occurrences that have been taking place in the past few weeks.
11053 : Let me tell you a little of what I have heard... Recently, the Duchy has been abuzz with strange tales of travelers being drawn into strange whirlpools located in the Valkurm Dunes and on Qufim Island...and never coming back.
11054 : From what I gather, the ducal scientists believe this phenomenon has something to do with the shattered Telepoints at the Crags of Holla, Dem, and Mea.
11055 : To collect data, a group of Ducal Guards is to be dispatched any day.
11056 : Strange whirlpools in Valkurm and Qufim... Shattered Telepoints... What could it all mean?
11057 : The investigatory report written by the Ducal Guards mentioned that the whirlpools in Valkurm and Qufim are made up of an unknown substance that they call the Emptiness.
11058 : And now there are rumors stating that by jumping into these dark vortexes, people can instantly teleport themselves to the lost island of Tavnazia! I don't know about you, but I am staying right here where it is safe!
11059 : I've heard rumors that a bright light shot out of the sea somewhere to the north of Delkfutt's Tower.
11060 : An investigatory party is scheduled to search the area for clues, but they'll have their work cut out for them. The currents in the Sea of Shu'Meyo are unpredictable and violent. Many a captain has lost his ship in those waters.
11061 : Did you know there is a mysterious group of officials in Jeuno known as the Armathrwn Society?
11062 : The last time I tried telling some of the new recruits about the group, Captain Wolfgang put me on latrine duty for nine and a half weeks!
11063 : You, a scruffy adventurer, spoke with Sir Nag'molada!?
11064 : Did you know that he was a high-ranking member of the prestigious Armathrwn Society--the advisors to Archduke Kam'lanaut?
11065 : Sir Nag'molada often speaks with common people of the Duchy. I even heard that promotions are granted to those who happen to impress him.
11066 : I wonder if he will ever stop to speak with me... What would I say?
11067 : You're an adventurer, right? So you've probably already heard about the humongous dragon that flew over the western skies.
11068 : At first everybody thought it might be a stray wyvern, but there are rumors that it was actually one of those ancient wyrms!
11069 : You want to know about the hooded officials in black robes that sometimes appear in the courtyard?
11070 : They are all members of the Armathrwn Society--scientists working for the Duchy. I have heard that there are even quite a few female members.
11071 : While the Jeuno Armada is making preparations for battle, it remains the duty of the Ducal Guard to ensure the safety of the citizens of Jeuno.
11072 : Did you hear that a super-secret weapon was being loaded onto one of the warships? I wonder what it could be...
11073 : Yes, I overheard some of the other guards mention that the society's scientists had built a terrifying new battle machine.
11074 : Alright! After using that contraption, along with the airships' ultra-powerful mammoth cannons, there won't be enough left of those wyrms to even make dragon burgers!
11075 : The Jeuno Armada is readying for an attack on the Wyrmking, Bahamut. However, there is nothing to worry about. Our forces are the strongest, most advanced in all Vana'diel.
11076 : Have you seen a strange-looking boy or girl running about the gardens?
11077 : If you have, inform one of the Ducal Guards. There are currently warrrrants out for both of their arrrrests.
11078 : Their capture is crucial to the safety of not just Jeuno, but of all Vana'diel. You and your fellow adventurers' assistance in the matter is greatly appreciated.
11079 : Members of the Armathrwn Society are to accompany the armada on its mission. It is said that the society's technological advancements are what built this city and made it what it is today.
11080 : Lady Esha'ntarl is supposedly leading the mission against Bahamut. With such a skilled commander at the armada's helm, there isn't anything in Vana'diel that can stop the Duchy!
11081 : I know you may consider your nation a powerful force in Vana'diel, but Jeuno is the only nation with the resources to defeat the Wyrmking. Don't you forget it.
11082 : One of the armada warships is missing! With all the tightened security, how could anyone have pulled off a feat as grand as stealing an airship!?
11083 : While the Jeuno Armada is conducting its mission in the skies, it remains the duty of the Ducal Guard to ensure the safety of the citizens of Jeuno.
11084 : Did you find out anything more about the super-secret weapon the armada took with them?
11085 : No... However, I did hear that the device dealt a severe blow to the mighty Wyrmking during the assault.
11086 : Wowzie! If I had an ultra-spiffy contraption like that, I'd be eating roast dragon burgers every night!
11087 : The latest reports state the recent armada mission was a success. However, it did not completely stop the Wyrmking and his minions. It is rumored that the fleet will launch its second attack once the current repairs on the warships are completed.
11088 : If you have any information on the whereabouts of the girl the Duchy was searching for, I am sorry, but the warrant for her arrest has been dropped.
11089 : The Ducal Guard recently received news of her death...
11090 : Even with the technology of the Armathrwn Society on our side, the armada was unable to completely defeat the Wyrmking and his army. Perhaps we underestimated their power...
11091 : In its first wave of attacks, the armada was successful in dealing a large amount of damage to Bahamut. The Wyrmking will not stand a chance against the second wave.
11092 : <Sigh> I requested a transfer from the Ducal Guard to the armada crew, but I was turned down...
11093 : Why do I have to stand around the gardens while everyone else is having all the fun? Look at these biceps! I could take out a wyrm with one blow! Well...maybe two blows.
11094 : We were beginning to wonder when you would arrive, %.
11095 : The duke vicarious is meeting a messenger from the East as we speak. When she is finished, you shall be next. Until then, you shall be kept in custody.
11096 : I apologize for the absence of Grand Duke Kam'lanaut. I, Esha'ntarl, shall serve in his stead.
11097 : I hear that you have come from the Eastern Empire to ask something of our nation. State your name and your request.
11098 : ...I am Tenzen. Born and raised in the Far East, I serve as a samurai under the mighty dynasty.
11099 : Lady Esha'ntarl, may I ask why my audience was not met by the duke himself?
11100 : [Since the revival of the Shadow Lord/Even after the defeat of the Shadow Lord], the grand duke has been overwhelmed with his duties to the people of this land.
11101 : However, you need not worry. I will take the responsibility of relaying your words directly to Lord Kam'lanaut.
11102 : These two shall be witness to that.
11103 : ...
11104 : While short, my message is not a simple one. It is critical that the duke fully understands the grave nature of the situation that lies before us.
11105 : What I am about to say does not only affect my homeland, but the countries to the south and west, as well as this fair land.
11106 : The Emptiness is closing in. It has already appeared in the far reaches of the Eastern Empire. I can assume that the same is true of the outlying areas in the southern and western lands.
11107 : The phenomenon started small, but in recent months it has begun to grow. Like sap oozes slowly from a tree, the Emptiness spreads across my country, swallowing whole the hills and forests.
11108 : As it approaches, the children begin to dream. When it arrives, it is not long before the adults, too, begin to dream.
11109 : The dream is always the same... It tells us...the Keeper of the Apocalypse will soon appear, and bring with him the end of Vana'diel.
11110 : The Keeper of the Apocalypse... A frightening name, is it not?
11111 : Your report of this darkness--this Emptiness--it is not news to us. In recent weeks, there have been reports of similar phenomena occurring in the areas around Jeuno.
11112 : However, these reports state that the Emptiness, as you call it, is localized. That is why we have chosen to withhold this information from the public until it can be further researched. If it is true that the Emptiness has begun to spread, though, an immediate investigation may be necessary.
11113 : Shall the Duchy prepare a team?
11114 : ... You...do not know why the Emptiness has appeared?
11115 : Unfortunately, our scientists have not yet come to any concrete conclusions. If your empire has any definite data, we would be delighted to hear it.
11116 : Are you suggesting that the cause of the Emptiness may be found in my land? Do not tell me that you are unaware that the five shards of legend rest here!
11117 : Do not tell me that you are unaware that it is the power of the five shards that protects Vana'diel from the Emptiness!
11118 : Tenzen of the East... You are very straightforward with your accusations.
11119 : Let me see... You feel that Jeuno is the cause of the Emptiness's growth. You feel that our attempts to harness the power of the crystals have resulted in the spread of the darkness, am I correct?
11120 : Well, I am sorry to say that you are quite mistaken. Jeuno is fully aware of the power that the crystals radiate forth.
11121 : The five shards--the mothercrystals--are what support our world.
11122 : We, the Duchy, have taken it upon ourselves to inherit the will of the ancients and protect the Zilartian ruins and the crystals they hold.
11123 : We have kept this information from the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria to shield the mothercrystals from those who may wish to wrongly use their power for personal gain.
11124 : I see that the Eastern Empire has learned of the crystals' existence, and therefore we can no longer trust you, either.
11125 : Jeuno cannot allow the power of the mothercrystals to fall into the hands of those who may exploit it.
11126 : My country's only wish is to prevent the Emptiness from taking away any more than it already has!
11127 : Seeing, with your own eyes, the darkness drain the life from your homeland... I can understand why you may not agree with our nation's stance.
11128 : Very well. I can tell you one thing. The Duchy is currently in search of a boy. This boy is thought to be connected in some way to the Emptiness.
11129 : Even though he is not one of us, he has already found a way into three of the Zilartian ruins, the Emptiness following in his path.
11130 : We here believe that this boy is the Keeper of the Apocalypse of which you speak.
11131 : A boy? Could he be a messenger from another nation?
11132 : That we do not know. However...
11133 : Wolfgang. Show the adventurer in.
11134 : This adventurer was with the boy when he appeared near the mothercrystals. [He/She] hails from the nation of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst].
11135 : [San d'Oria/The Republic/The Federation]! What could [the king/the president/those mages] be conspiring!?
11136 : Of course, [the Kingdom/Bastok/Windurst] has denied all ties to the boy.
11137 : As has this adventurer.
11138 : However, if we learn that [San d'Oria/the Republic/the Federation] is behind this threat to the mothercrystals and the well-being of all those residing on Vana'diel...
11139 : Whether allies or not, Jeuno will be forced to take action against the nation. We will destroy them.
11140 : But this is still nothing more than speculation. If we had the time to conduct a proper investigation, it would be the first thing we did. Unfortunately, time is one luxury we do not have.
11141 : And that is why we must capture the boy immediately to learn of what he knows...
11142 : Exactly. And that is why I offer you a chance--a chance to prove your country's true intents by joining this battle to save your nation--no, all of Vana'diel.
11143 : Adventurer. Travel to the fourth crystal and wait for the boy. When he arrives, capture him and bring him here.
11144 : Unlike the first three crystals, the fourth lies deep beneath Vana'diel's surface, somewhere below the glaciers of the Northlands.
11145 : Thirty years ago, an allied expedition visited the Northlands. If you could find one of the original members, you may be able to obtain some valuable information.
11146 : Francmage M Mistalle, of the Knights Mistalle in San d'Oria... Iru-Kuiru, from the Rhinostery in Windurst... Mythril Musketeer captain, Ulrich, from Bastok...
11147 : I have heard news that the criminal accused of destroying the Telepoints was captured and taken into custody.
11148 : However, when questioned, [he/she] said she had nothing to do with the incidents. To prove [his/her] innocence, the Duchy has ordered the scoundrel to travel to the nations of Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria and gather information that will clear [his/her] name.
11149 : What is this? You say you have business with the captain?
11150 : Ah, %. I was looking for you.
11151 : Esha'ntarl, duke vicarious, would like to hear your account of what transpired in the Northlands.
11152 : ...? What is this envelope?
11153 : From Doctor Monberaux? Why would he...?
11154 : However, first things first. Follow me.
11155 : Ah, welcome back, adventurer.
11156 : I see that you were unsuccessful in protecting the fourth crystal.
11157 : And now it is looking more and more like you are the one who is leading the boy...
11158 : Relax, adventurer. I am not blaming you for anything.
11159 : Nag'molada kept the secret of the amulet to himself.
11160 : It is his foolishness that acted as a catalyst for what occurred in the Northlands.
11161 : And now that we know the true identity of the boy, there is no reason to further suspect your nation's involvement. I apologize for not trusting you.
11162 : However, now we must put aside our misunderstandings and unite to save our world from being destroyed. Will you help us protect the mothercrystals?
11163 : Join forces with Jeuno? Yes. No.
11164 : We have caused you much suffering, and I understand your anger. On behalf of the Duchy I ask for your forgiveness.
11165 : %...
11166 : In the presence of the fourth crystal, I have learned that a strange occurrence took place.
11167 : Is it true that the girl you took with you actually helped Selh'teus and thwarted the plans of our Nag'molada?
11168 : It is extremely important that you do not withhold information from us.
11169 : Is it true? Yes. No.
11170 : I see... The Duchy is currently searching for that girl.
11171 : We do not wish to punish her. We feel that she may be in grave danger. We must find her so we can protect her.
11172 : The first threat to her will be Nag'molada. He is already attempting to make it seem as if the fall of the fourth crystal was the girl's fault.
11173 : If he finds her, he will more than likely poison her mind, preventing her from speaking of anything that may harm his plan.
11174 : The second threat will be the boy, Selh'teus. His next destination will most surely be the fifth and final crystal.
11175 : However, this crystal lies deep beneath the sea, and the only one who knows how to reach it is the girl.
11176 : Finally, the third threat will consist of assassins from the south.
11177 : You may have already heard the rumors of the Mithran sin hunters who have crossed the southern seas to try the theologians of Tavnazia.
11178 : These hunters will not give up until they have punished all those they seek.
11179 : And that is why we need your help, %.
11180 : If you find the girl, bring her here. No harm will be brought to her. I swear on the name of the Goddess.
11181 : Lady Esha'ntarl!
11182 : %. Did you tell them everything that happened in the Northlands?
11183 : My plan was flawless! If it wasn't for that despicable girl, Prishe, I would have captured Selh'teus, and this whole ordeal would be solved!
11184 : That girl heard the whisper of Selh'teus's soul, sang the Memoria de la S^tona, and helped him escape!
11185 : The testament of affinity she possesses--it connects the hearts and souls of men. Selh'teus has been using that to control her!
11186 : ...
11187 : But now we have the chance to find out his true intentions.
11188 : If we can capture the girl, we can use her to tap into Selh'teus's mind. We can learn if he truly arrived to save Al'Taieu!
11189 : You miserable man! Are you saying Selh'teus does not know that our crusade ended long ago?
11190 : You fool! Are you saying Selh'teus does not know that the celestial capital was destroyed long ago?
11191 : Perhaps it is we who do not know the true outcome of the crusade or the true fate of our capital!
11192 : I propose that an expedition be sent to Al'Taieu.
11193 : There we may find the answers to why Selh'teus survived all the centuries, and why he continues to poison the mothercrystals.
11194 : And that is why we must first investigate the line leading to the fifth crystal.
11195 : Please, grant me access to the Crystal Terminal!
11196 : ... I understand why you feel an expedition to Al'Taieu is necessary.
11197 : However...
11198 : [The Armathrwn Society/Kam'lanaut] has already made a decision on this matter. I seem to recall that you have been given orders to research the Moblin city that was discovered near Bastok.
11199 : All affairs concerning Selh'teus have been left to Esha'ntarl. You are not to interfere.
11200 : But, Lady Esha'ntarl has been given the assignment of Bahamut.
11201 : Selh'teus is a much graver problem than you can imagine. I do not think...
11202 : Yes, you do not think! Did you really believe attacking the boy with the Eye of Altana would defeat him!?
11203 : Your impudence is the cause of all our troubles!
11204 : But...
11205 : Nag'molada, do not misunderstand us. [The society does/Kam'lanaut does] not intend to pry at your faults.
11206 : The reason we have entrusted you with the Moblin investigation is because your excellent Kuluu powers of negotiation are vital for the success of the mission.
11207 : But Lady Esha'ntarl! You do not realize how powerful the boy has become...
11208 : Now with the Eye gone and the path to the fifth crystal sealed, how do you plan on dealing with him!?
11209 : I don't think you even have a plan!
11210 : Very well, let me inform you of how we plan to stop Selh'teus.
11211 : We can draw him forth without traveling to the fifth crystal. We can seal him without your precious Eye of Altana.
11212 : H-how...!?
11213 : You can hear me, can you not...Selh'teus?
11214 : It is I who possess the other amulet you seek.
11215 : I am waiting, Selh'teus! Come and fulfill the pact!
11216 : Here, take this envelope back to the doctor. It does not belong to me.
11217 : But why would he try to...?
11218 : Not but a few moments ago, Sir Nag'molada passed by this station. However, he did not seem himself. I wonder if something is wrong...
11219 : Even Captain Wolfgang has been looking disturbed since he received that envelope. What ever could be going on?

11240 : % and % cannot be used here.
11241 : %... Now that I have passed from the mortal realm, I have only you to turn to. The time left to me is short.
11242 : Thirty years ago, I came into contact with the insidious power of this land, and rose from the grave. However, at the same time, this world laid claim to a part of my soul...
11243 : I have been released from the hate that consumed me, but the half of my soul that was taken captive all those years ago is calling to me... It has become a towering darkness. A raging hatred, spawned from the depths of my being...
11244 : Very soon I will be drawn into that soul. I no longer have the strength to resist. The soul that was divided will become whole once more, and that rage will take on physical form.
11245 : A new Shadow Lord will be born. Surely you have sensed the growing evil? The beastman armies that are imprisoned here are massing for battle. They plan a return to the world of their origin, the realm that exists beneath the light of hope.
11246 : My link to you will soon be severed, so listen carefully. Thirty years ago, an expeditionary squad formed from the elite soldiers of each nation was sent to investigate the Northlands. You must have seen their memories when you first laid your hand upon the chunks of magicite.
11247 : Seek out the markings that the expedition members left behind. They will aid you in gaining entrance to this world. You must defeat the Shadow Lord before our unification is complete. My hopes go with you, %.
11248 : There is an unusual arrangement of branches here.
11249 : There is an unusual arrangement of pebbles here.
11250 : The strands of grass here have been tied together.
11251 : There is an unusual arrangement of leaves on the ground.
11252 : I see you have met with Raogrimm. His soul is no longer confined to that incarnation of rage, the Shadow Lord, yet the fact remains that he has committed sins beyond redemption.
11253 : In spite of those sins, I still wish to rescue him from the darkness. I no longer have a mortal body with which to act, and so the most I can do is guide you in my stead.
11254 : You will need the %, a key that bridges the void between Vana'diel and that other world.
11255 : It is said that there are items in this world that gain a soul of their own through contact with the thoughts and dreams of other living creatures. The % is one of those items.
11256 : You must look for the Goblin peddlers. They are certain to have knowledge of the %. When you have it safely within your grasp, seek out the markings that we left behind...
11257 : That world is a land now draped in the blackest night. We can pass from one world to the other, but without the physical forms lost to us thirty years ago, there is little we can do to intervene.
11258 : Raogrimm is the one who... No, the world has been divided into separate realms through the machinations of the new Shadow Lord.
11259 : The Shadow Lord resides in the Xarcabard of the other reality. However, I fear you would be marching to your death should you go to confront him... I ask you to first obtain trophies from four of the alternate realms.
11260 : We understand that there is little time to spare. But without a certain degree of power, it will be impossible to traverse the land the Shadow Lord holds in thrall. Show me your strength with the four trophies you bring back.
11261 : Those whose fate is linked to his world will empower the % to guide you...
11262 : I never believed that my indifference to the state of other nations would cause harm to my beloved San d'Oria...
11263 : As part of my penance, I will infuse the % with what guidance I can.
11264 : I betrayed him... And now I am needed, the one who cut down poor Cornelia. The man cursed with the brand of traitor...
11265 : Sure, I got everything I wanted, but what was left to me in the end? For one rash action, all I gained was an empty title and irreconcilable guilt...
11266 : I doubt you'll listen to the words of a traitor, but please, help free him from the bonds of his eternal night...
11267 : Our expedition was supposed to have been an allied effortaru, but not one of us was interested in the fate of the other nations. In our hasty-waste to outdo each other, we failed to see to the heart of the mattaru.
11268 : Our attitudes led to the death of two of our members, and precipitated the birth of the Shadow Lord... This sin does not belong on Raogrimm's shoulders alone. We all mustaru atone for our actions.
11269 : Please help him. Help Raogrimm escape from his horrid-worrid darkness, forever this time.
11270 : Humes and Galka have never been the best of friends. I used to think that was just the way it was, and always would be.
11271 : I figured I'd be causing myself grrrief if I stuck my whiskers into other nations' problems. My next catnap was all that mattered to me in those days. Ignorrrance is bliss, as they say.
11272 : Responsibility for Raogrimm's trrransformation lies with all of us who traveled with him on that expedition. By sharing the blame for the crimes he committed as the Shadow Lord, we can finally call ourselves his trrrue companions.
11273 : Let me help you on your path. May guiding light fill this %! Raogrimm's fate is in your hands.
11274 : There is a broken branch thrust into the ground here.
11275 : There is a symbol carved into the rock here.
11276 : I have been waiting for you.
11277 : Do you remember the last words Raogrimm spoke to you? "The link will soon be severed"... Do you understand the significance of these words?
11278 : When the soul that was divided is whole once again, towering rage will take on physical form... Yes, a new Shadow Lord will be born. Even I will no longer hear his voice.
11279 : Even now, I can barely feel the emanations of Raogrimm's faltering spirit. When those emanations fade completely, he will be...
11280 : The Xarcabard of that other realm is shrouded in a vast darkness, preventing contact from the outside. Even those of us without material bodies are unable to penetrate that mist of eternal night.
11281 : Until that mist clears, I cannot guide you to Xarcabard.  The next place you must venture is the twin of Vana'diel's Beaucedine. There you will find the last trophy to complete the set of keys we need.
11282 : You must obtain the last trophy. All five trophies combined with our power will create a synergistic force, allowing us to part the shroud for a few precious moments. It will open a path between worlds.
11283 : Take care, my brave adventurer. May the blessings of Altana guide and protect you...
11284 : Even after the blackest night, the golden sun always rises to begin a new morning. This troubled land will soon have its dawn...of that I am certain.
11285 : I never thought to walk this land again, not even in death. Is this what they call karma...?
11286 : This land has borne the weight of my sins. I will not beg for forgiveness, but accept my responsibility...
11287 : So this is the reason for that unspeakable terror I feltaru here when I was still alive. It's possible that the other realm has existed for much longer than anyone ever dreamed... Keep your wits aboutaru you, %.
11288 : I'm not rrreally fond of touching platitudes. Snap Raogrimm to his senses with a big ol' smack to the head for me.
11289 : It is time! Put an end to this thirty-year nightmare, %. %! Show us the path to Xarcabard!
11290 : Death does not exist in that realm. You might call it a prison of souls.
11291 : Even those who fall in battle will rise again after a time as if nothing had happened. Like a flame returning to a candle whose light has been extinguished...
11292 : It is an endless succession of life and death. How many times has that cycle repeated itself in that damned abode?
11293 : There is one thing that bothers me. Whatever happened to the original wielders of the weapons and armor that the beastmen there now possess? If the statues in the shape of Orcs and such were once actual beastmen, then...? But I get carried away with my musings.
11294 : Please pay no mind to my ramblings. You have secured the %. An incredible feat. It proves the strength of your conviction, and is one of the keys you will need to enter Xarcabard.
11295 : You will need four such trophies. Once you have them within your grasp, make your way to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. Cornelia awaits you there.
11296 : I don't know about the other four, but I can't hear his voice anymore...
11297 : Is this another brand I must bear for my treachery? I must truly be hated if that's the case.
11298 : It is something I would wish for at the moment, however. I pray this silence is just a continuation of our incompatible personalities. If not, then it means his pronouncement has become reality...
11299 : %. This is more than just a testament to your strength. It is one of the keys that will lead you to Xarcabard, along with the trophies of the other realms.
11300 : When you have all four trophies, travel to Beaucedine Glacier in the Northlands. You will find Cornelia waiting for you there. That is all the wisdom I have left to give you.
11301 : What is the true nature of that other world? I can only explain it as a place that lies beyond the limitarus of our knowledge. But I'm sure I've feltaru that aura somewhere before...
11302 : That's it. That protocrystal I came across when I was doing research in Elshimo. The magical emanations coming from the crystal gave me a similar impression. An avatar? No, that can'taru be...
11303 : Oh! Oh, I'm terribly-werribly sorry! I appear to have driftarued into my old habits.
11304 : Now, %. This % is both a symbol of your fortitude, and one of the keys that will help you gain access to Xarcabard. The trophies from the other three realms carry the same importance.
11305 : Gather all four trophies and hurry yourself on to Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia will be waiting for you when you get there. But be wary, %. The blackness enveloping that world grows ever deeper, ever darker...
11306 : The beastmen of that world carry the spoils of prrrevious battles. Equipment that you or I would use.
11307 : I'm not able to touch them in my prrresent form, but I feel something about those weapons and armor...something extrrraordinary.
11308 : Wait, wait, wait! I don't mean that they're currrsed or anything like that! It's something more like, um, not ominous, but... How can I explain it?
11309 : Anyway! They're not evil, just...you know? Different from other normal swords and things. Being all ghostlike and stuff, you can feel things like that.
11310 : But enough of that kinda talk--congrrratulations are in order! You've got your paws on the %! It shows you've got the goods in the hero department, and it will also help you get into Xarcabard.
11311 : But first you've got to collect the other three trophies and then hightail it to snowy Beaucedine Glacier. Cornelia should be up there waiting for you.
11312 : % and the four trophies. These artifacts have long been lost to that other world.  The Hydra Corps was a unit formed after our expedition to the Northlands.
11313 : It must have been in the time of the Great War... Nobody knows how the Hydra artifacts came to be there, but those five trophies will open the path for you.
11314 : Each of these items holds a measure of power. However, the strength of a single artifact is limited.
11315 : The % and the %. Combining these separate entities created a bridge from Vana'diel to the other realms. Xarcabard, I'm afraid, is another matter entirely...
11316 : Unless the shroud of darkness is lifted, that power alone will not be enough to open the way. However, the five trophies resonate with another artifact that lies within his land. If we can join our strength to theirs...
11317 : Let us make haste to the land where this all began. To Xarcabard...
11318 : Is it over...?
11319 : No, the rage has merely been dispersed.
11320 : As long as I exist, he will never truly die...
11321 : Or perhaps an eternal soul is something beyond the concept of death?
11322 : %... You have achieved an incredible feat--the unification of the Shadow Lord has been prevented. I have not the words to express my gratitude.
11323 : The power of the crystal has faded, but I will be drawn into that towering rage no more. I have heard the voice of the one who holds sway over this realm...
11324 : The one who holds sway...?
11325 : Yes. From the center of infinite darkness. I was in a place beyond comprehension when those words reached into my mind...
11326 : You who have touched the crystal, the one who holds immortal power within a mortal shell. The rage that has arisen from your twisted core will devour my world.
11327 : It was an error in judgment to shelter you... The order of my realm has been disrupted.
11328 : I give to you a duty... You will stand vigil until an age without hatred has dawned.
11329 : No matter what terrible power you might wield, there is no escape from Dynamis for an incomplete soul. No return to the land of blessed light...
11330 : What manner of being was this who spoke from a pit of blackness? As this question gnawed at my mind, the voice grew quiet, leaving me in unanswered silence.
11331 : Of one thing I was certain. This voice belonged to the ruler of Dynamis.
11332 : A flow of energy exists in Vana'diel that has escaped the notice of those who dwell there.
11333 : Thirty years past, my contact with the crystal caused an accelerated change in this flow. It was as if it had leapt forward, rushing along a deliberate course.
11334 : Nobody knows what lies at the end of this journey. Perhaps it will reveal the true nature of Vana'diel.
11335 : %, you may be the one to witness this truth.
11336 : The power stored in the % will soon be drained. And I must remain in this world in my role of observer.
11337 : Do not forget who you are, %. I bid farewell to a most heroic adventurer.
11338 : My old companions...?
11339 : This duty is too much for just one to bear. If you will have me, I will stand at your side until an age without hatred has arrived. It pains me to see the depths to which my country has fallen.
11340 : That is my only reason for staying. Do not misunderstand my motivations.
11341 : Blessed light and the ruler of Dynamis? I do believe you've rekindled my long-forgotten sense of adventure.
11342 : Once I've gotten all firedy-up, even you can'taru keep me back, Raogrimm. I'm sure my incomparable research skills will be of use in your task.
11343 : C'mon, let's see a little excitement! This is our expedition's thirty-year rrreunion.
11344 : It's not the Northlands this time. None of us are going to grow old and die, so who else would you want with you on a task as long as this one?
11345 : I'm not gonna back down, no matterrr how much you complain. Better just give in and accept the fact that you're stuck with me.
11346 : I thought this would be the end of you for sure... Hmph. You're just as thick-skinned as you used to be.
11347 : What, no words for an old friend? Thinking about testing your theory on whether or not a soul can be killed?
11348 : I betrayed you! I extinguished the light of your precious Cornelia! The man responsible for this entire nightmare stands right before you!
11349 : Everything began thirty years ago. And there were things that came to an end... Even though I was a prisoner of uncontrollable rage, the fact remains that I took the lives of my companions with my own hands.
11350 : And yet, my old companions, you are the ones who have saved me from falling into that pit of hatred a second time.
11351 : I have words of gratitude, but do not stand in a position to blame anyone for their actions. No matter who that person may be.
11352 : Raogrimm...
11353 : Are you sure you want to do this? This duty will continue until hatred has faded from the land. As long as my divided soul remains, there may never be an end to that rage...
11354 : Raogrimm. There is no need to suffer alone anymore. Our presence here should answer your question.
11355 : There are crimes that must be atoned for. And if that means staying on after death and watching over this world, then we who were your companions will share the burden along with you.
11356 : Until the dawn of an age without hatred... No, as long as this world continues to be, I will remain by your side.
11357 : Cornelia...
11360 : There is a strange symbol drawn here. A haunting chill sweeps through you as you gaze upon it...
11361 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: Present the %...if you wish to pass into...my dream.
11362 : You hear a mysterious, floating voice: The sands of time yet fall... Present the...%.
11363 : I am the ruler of Dynamis.
11364 : Are you lost? Or are you here by your own reckless designs? Either way, this is not your dream.
11365 : The dreamer of this realm is a separate entity than he who dreamt of that wasteland of malice, Xarcabard.
11366 : Who would dare bring a new dream into my world of Dynamis?
11367 : I divided my form in order to find the answer, but my counterpart has yet to return to me.
11368 : While wandering through this realm, you may come across another semblance of myself.
11369 : The memory of our encounter will become a guide to my shadow as it wanders this dream.
11370 : Search for my counterpart, and unite this realm with your own dream.
11371 : A nightmare curses this land yet again.
11372 : Take heed, dream traveler.
11373 : I have been watching your dream.
11374 : But you cannot grasp the identity of this realm's dreamer from there. This land will continue to devour its way into Dynamis.
11375 : You must find my counterpart and crush the dreamer of this realm.
11376 : I see that you have gathered three slivers of black crystal...
11377 : The Emptiness is sealed inside of them. Those are no mere fragments.
11378 : Those pieces of crystal have led you to this place... The source of this nightmare is near. I can feel the dreamer's presence.
11379 : The entrance to the dream has already been opened. Find and destroy the source if you wish to protect my realm.
11380 : I am...a unique entity...
11381 : We are...comprised of all entities...
11382 : Intermingling with one another...dividing among each other...
11383 : And devouring one another...
11384 : The shadow that you defeated had been consumed by the dreamer of this realm.
11385 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who have come into contact with the Emptiness.
11386 : It seems that this nightmare was dreamt into existence by beings who came into contact with the Emptiness.
11387 : Could it have been that girl...? When I next see her, she will pay dearly.
11388 : Could it have been that girl...? No, there was one more, transformed after death...
11389 : Her malice will not perish as long as this dream continues, using my shadows to revive countless times.
11390 : You must confront the nightmare and continue to fight them to keep this realm from spreading.
11391 : The dreamer is not the girl who once harbored the Emptiness... Could it have been transferred to another girl...?
11392 : You know this girl well. I could take care of her easily, but if you wish me to spare her, then you will lend me your power.
11393 : Trade the % to the Hieroglyphics found in each area. The % will be transformed into %.
11394 : From that point on, one of the areas of Dynamis will be reserved by the bearer of the %. The destination and time to be spent in Dynamis will be recorded in the help text of the %.

11433 : ... At last we meet.
11434 : I have been freed from my prison and can soak up the sweat and blood of this world once more.
11435 : Wait, there is something I must...
11436 : This place is...?
11437 : I see... You must be the new wielder for these.
11438 : Yes, with your fighting spirit I believe you will be able to master the %.
11439 : The % have long accompanied me, along both rough and gentle paths. It is not easy to give them up, but...here.
11440 : They belong to you now. I ask that you consider my... Ah, but that is past now. I bid you farewell....
11441 : ...
11442 : I hope you don't think this is the end.
11443 : Your real life as a martial artist is just beginning. Time to start your training anew!
11444 : ... Finally! We finally meet face to face!
11445 : I have a presence in this world again! What an exhilarating feeling!
11446 : Ah yes, there is one more thing...
11447 : Eh? What?
11448 : Oh. You must be this one's new owner.
11449 : With your dagger skills, you'll make a perfect wielder for the %.
11450 : It is most difficult to give up a weapon that has seen me through so many tight spots, but you have earned it.
11451 : Treat her well...
11452 : ...
11453 : Splendid! From this day forth, I belong to you.
11454 : So, what kind of games shall we play? And where shall we go to play them? Who are we going to kill when we get there? It's all just too exciting...!
11455 : ... Thou hast found me.
11456 : I have now thrice shown my true form in this world.
11457 : A moment...
11458 : ... What has happened to me?
11459 : I see, you are the sword's new owner?
11460 : Well, this is most encouraging! A master of swordplay such as yourself should have no trouble wielding %.
11461 : When the world lies in chaos, this blade appears before the one meant to wield it. It is yours... Restore order to Vana'diel!
11462 : And now I, too, can rest unburdened...
11463 : ...
11464 : Thou art blessed this day.
11465 : Henceforth, I shall be thy blade. For the sake of thy companions, for justice in this world, wield my power in the name of honor...
11466 : ... You have found me.
11467 : Allow me to show my respect. You who have gained the strength of so many must be a true hero.
11468 : But first...
11469 : Who are you?
11470 : This must be some sort of joke. You are the new wielder of this weapon?
11471 : Hmmm, perhaps I have misjudged you. With your level of skill, you may be able to handle this beastly blade, and have the will to control its awesome power.
11472 : However, this is a magical blade. It is a sword that calls upon destruction. Its malice will gnaw away at your body and soul even as you topple enemies with its strength.
11473 : Do not forget this truth! Keep it always in your mind. My regards go with you, stranger...
11474 : ...
11475 : Now, my heroic master...
11476 : For what purpose will you wield my power? The choices before you are without limit. Will you become the ruler of this world? Or perhaps...
11477 : ... You...me, meet.
11478 : Me...free... Thanks to you. Me, your...
11479 : Wait...
11480 : What the...?
11481 : Ah, now I see. The wheel has turned.
11482 : Truthfully spoken, I am thankful. % is a splendid axe, but ever does it hunger.
11483 : I have taken many lives to sate its need, and have reached the end of my strength.
11484 : You have my gratitude. You have freed me from my nightmare, and now I can sleep with a tranquil spirit...
11485 : ...
11486 : You, master, me. Good, work. Me, thank, you.
11487 : Master, me, hunger. Go, hunt? Find, prey? Me, cut, flesh. Break, bone. Drink, blood. Master, me, hunger...
11488 : ... Ah, you found me!
11489 : I have been freed from a world where life and death, reality and illusion are impossible to tell apart. I am truly grateful.
11490 : One moment...
11491 : ... This is...Jeuno!? Have I finally returned?
11492 : I... Nobody can see me. This is merely a reflection of reality. Which means you are the one to inherit the axe.
11493 : Hmm. With your polished skills, you will make a fine master for %.
11494 : The one who wields this axe must also be beautiful to look upon. Apparently, I was a suitable candidate. Do you not agree?
11495 : Congratulations. I expect you to perform great deeds from this day onwards. I also ask that someday you use % to avenge the Hydra Corps...
11496 : ...
11497 : I congratulate you also...my new master.
11498 : Now hold me high and let my blade glint in the sunlight! Let your friends, as well as your enemies, feast upon my glorious beauty!
11499 : ... You have found me.
11500 : My forbidden power is now yours, and I am liberated from my prison.
11501 : You have but to gain her respect...
11502 : Such a long dream I was having...
11503 : It was a dream held captive by a shrouded world. No. I must accept that it was no dream.
11504 : And you? Do you seek the same darkness that I did... It seems you have already found your way to %.
11505 : Very well, I will pass it on to you. But do not forget how much blood your companions spilled in your search for its unholy strength.
11506 : And think long and hard on whether or not this power should be used. Do not end up like me...
11507 : ...
11508 : Heh. Heh heh. Hahahahahahaha!
11509 : Well, my new master, is it not time to begin the journey for ever greater power? There are enemies yet to fell, and blood yet to spill...
11510 : ... You have unearthed me at last.
11511 : I am free from Dynamis, free to fly through the heavens once more.
11512 : All that remains is...
11513 : Hello? Is it possible that I...
11514 : But, no. I have not returned to this realm... You. You are to be my successor?
11515 : You certainly seem to have the required skill with the lance. Enough to convince % to lend you its power, at any rate.
11516 : Having this spear on the battlefield makes you a match for almost any opponent.
11517 : Think well on what this means, and on how a weapon like this should be used. You have my admiration, adventurer. You have done well...
11518 : ...
11519 : The ceremony of inheritance is complete.
11520 : It is time for you to go forth and experience my overwhelming strength...
11521 : ... I have been rediscovered at last.
11522 : Thanks to you, I have made my escape from the shrouded land.
11523 : You must now gain the sanction of my master...
11524 : It is a pity, indeed.
11525 : This day has come far too soon for my liking.
11526 : However, you are a master of the ninja trade. I concede that you will make a fitting wielder of the %.
11527 : Take this blade as your own. Travel far down the path of the ninja.
11528 : I will be watching you from the shadows...
11529 : ...
11530 : A fine master...
11531 : My keen edge is now yours to wield. A sharpness said to make even demons wail...
11532 : ... This day has finally come.
11533 : I am to be released to this world for the first time in an age. Is this reason to celebrate, or despair...?
11534 : In any event...
11535 : What is going on here?
11536 : Ah, my successor has come.
11537 : I sought to master the way of the samurai, and traveled to the Far East for training. By the time I had gained the % and returned to my home, the Great War had begun.
11538 : When I think on it, my life has been a long road of trials. But to see the arrival of my successor makes me feel that all has not been in vain.
11539 : You have my gratitude. Farewell, %...
11540 : ...
11541 : It has been a hard path to reach this point.
11542 : But your journey in the way of the samurai has just begun. You have yet to attain perfection. Let us continue your training...
11543 : ... At long last, you have arrived.
11544 : I was not convinced you were serious about completing this trial...
11545 : You have proven me wrong...
11546 : I have heard of your coming.
11547 : You are to be the new master of this hammer of war?
11548 : Every time % is reborn it gains a new wielder, who ultimately must pass it on to a successor. I have swung this hammer for more than eight hundred years. I never wished to part with it.
11549 : However, there is little meaning in me keeping it now.  If you will wield this weapon for a just cause, I hand its power over to you.
11550 : Now, take the hammer and go! Just be careful with how you handle it. Do not let its might crush you as well...
11551 : ...
11552 : My might is yours to wield.
11553 : Go forth and experience the destructive power that laid low the Earth Serpent...
11554 : ... So, you have found me.
11555 : I must give you my thanks. I have been freed from the hell of Dynamis and can regain my true power once again.
11556 : And now...
11557 : Hwaah!
11558 : Just when I thought I had finally returned to this world, I find you standing here, ready to snatch my precious staff away.
11559 : Well, it's for the best, I suppose. In my current state, % is nothing more than an ornament, its power going to waste.
11560 : I entrust this staff to you! Take up %, %, and bind it to you in a contract of blood!
11561 : I take my leave of you now. I only wish that I was able to stay a little longer...
11562 : ...
11563 : I am yours to wield.
11564 : But you are not yet my master. By watching your actions from this time onwards, I will decide if you are worthy of the title...
11565 : ... You have discovered my resting place.
11566 : The prison of souls has let loose its shackles, and I am free to loose arrows in this world once more. My thanks.
11567 : Ah, one more test of your patience...
11568 : Where is this place?
11569 : Of course. How could I forget. I am Ghebben. I was entrusted with this bow by a warrior of the Far East.
11570 : Your hands tell me that your skill in archery is far from ordinary. % will fit snugly into your sure grasp.
11571 : However, this bow belongs to Sir Nasu, the warrior of whom I spoke. You must remember that you are merely its keeper for a time.
11572 : Farewell...
11573 : ...
11574 : It is an honor to be owned by a just master. Sir Ghebben was a truly splendid archer.
11575 : You are now the one to draw me in battle. I will be at your side on any road you choose to travel, along with the destructive power of my arrows.
11576 : ... We finally meet.
11577 : I am now free from the pit of Dynamis to spit fire in this world once again.
11578 : But I must ask you to wait before taking me into your possession...
11579 : Why'd you have to go and wake me up? I was having the most relaxing sleep. Oh, this place looks familiar...
11580 : Hm? You think you're the one who's going to take up my gun?
11581 : You do seem to have a fair eye for marksmanship. And % would look perfect nestled in the crook of your arm...
11582 : Well, I have no more use for this weapon, so I guess you can have it. But there is one thing I want you to remember.
11583 : This gun is a fearsome weapon that unleashes a blast upon your enemies many thousands of times greater in strength than the tiny effort it takes you to pull the trigger. Needless to say, be careful who you aim it at...
11584 : ...
11585 : A weapon has no will of its own. But it was made for a purpose.
11586 : Take me to a new battlefield, a new arena for the hunt...
11587 : ... I am saved.
11588 : Silenced for too long in the prison of Dynamis, I can once again let my brazen call echo through this land!
11589 : A few more moments, if you please...
11590 : Hello there. I am Terounalivet, a military musician of the Hydra Corps.
11591 : You've never heard of me? Before joining the army I was quite the famous bard, mobbed by fans in every town I passed through.
11592 : To be completely truthful, I am heartbroken to be giving up the %, the most famous of instruments, even to a fellow bard.
11593 : But an instrument only shows its true worth when being played. This horn should be delighted to be passed on to such a talent as yourself.
11594 : She has a capricious soul, but do treat her well. And do not forget that even without a raging battle, you can still play a tune for the simple enjoyment of those around you...
11595 : ...
11596 : He was a wonderful performer.
11597 : Let us be on our way. Our tour of the world has only just begun...

11647 : First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of Flammen-Brenner.
11648 : At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with Flamme, or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
11649 : Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
11650 : The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
11651 : The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
11652 : If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The match score section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
11653 : Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
11654 : You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
11655 : No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
11656 : The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed # members, or if there are fewer than # members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
11657 : Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
11658 : LS Liga is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
11659 : A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
11660 : The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
11661 : If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
11662 : After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
11663 : Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
11664 : In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
11665 : Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
11666 : Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
11667 : However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
11668 : Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
11669 : Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
11670 : The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
11671 : In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
11672 : In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
11673 : I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?

11999 : Finally, the official rules of Ballista state that after a set period of time, you are required to return any chevrons received. When that time has come, a Herald will collect your chevrons at the time of entry into a new match.

12018 : What do you wish to know about? Basic rules. About the Petra. About Sprint. About Scout. About Gate Breach. About area-specific rules. About returning to battle. About special rules. Nothing at the moment.
12019 : Ballista is an exercise once used by the San d'Orian armies to train the Royal Knights in the art of the siege. The word ballista means to throw a stone, and the game has been a part of Vana'dielian military history for centuries.
12020 : The rules are simple. Ballista is played by two teams over a number of hours (Vana'diel time). The team with the most points at the end of the match is the victor.
12021 : Players from both teams must search for Petras that a Herald has buried in various locations across the battlefield. The players must then take these stones and throw them into targets known as Rooks.
12022 : These Rooks can appear in various locations around the battlefield, and both teams are allowed to throw their Petras into them.
12023 : Finally, a player's strength is adjusted depending on his or her level. It is felt that this ultimately allows for a more balanced battle.
12024 : Petras can be buried anywhere. Once a player believes he or she has found one, the Quarry (/quarry) command should be used to dig up the area at his or her feet.
12025 : Sometimes a player may find items other than Petras, such as potions. These temporary items can only be used during the current match (or Best of Three series).
12026 : Players can carry more than one Petra, but they cannot throw the stones away once they have obtained them. However, players will lose their Petras if they: (1) Successfully throw them into a rook. (2) Leave the area. (3) Are knocked out.
12027 : But don't forget, a player will be unable to use the Sprint command while in possession of a Petra. And, players can only use the Scout command if they carry one of the stones.
12028 : As one can see, careful planning and impeccable timing are the keys to victory.
12029 : All participants of Ballista will have the ability to use the Sprint command. This will temporarily increase one's movement speed, creating a better chance to find and obtain Petras.
12030 : However, remember that once a player has obtained a Petra, he or she will be unable to use the Sprint command. In its place, though, one may use the Scout command.
12031 : The locations of the Rooks are constantly changing. This makes it quite difficult to find the targets by just randomly walking about the area.
12032 : Communication with one's team members is, of course, one way to locate Rooks. However, another way is by using the Scout command. This will inform a player of the approximate location of the nearest Rook.
12033 : Finally, Scout can only be used when a player is carrying a Petra. Because Sprint cannot be used at this time, players must be weary of approaching enemies.
12034 : So, a Petra has been obtained and a Rook located. Now all that's left is tossing the stone in, right? Wrong.
12035 : There is one aspect of Ballista that has yet to be mentioned...and this is where the real battle begins.
12036 : To throw a Petra into a Rook, a player must first wait until the Rook's gate is open. This takes impeccable timing, as the gate is only open for a short while.
12037 : But not just anyone can score points this way. A player must first take down a member of the opposing team and achieve Gate Breach status. Only then will his or her shots count.
12038 : This extreme method of combat is what made the ancient game of Ballista famous, and transformed its participants into heroes.
12039 : Running about looking for stones is no different from a child's game of hide-and-seek. Knowing when to strike is what separates the men from the boys.
12040 : The following match types are area-specific: All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Allowed: Jugner Forest All or Nothing (one match) * Normal Items Restricted: Pashhow Marshlands Best of Three (three matches) * Normal Items Allowed: Meriphataud Mountains
12041 : Best of Three series rules are as follows: Winning a match will earn a nation one match point. The nation with the most match points at the end of the series will be declared the victor. Winning the third and final match and producing the high scorer will result in two match points awarded. This allows both sides the chance for come-from-behind victories.
12042 : Between each of the matches, a short interval will be implemented. During this interval, Invisible and Sneak will be cast on all participants. We suggest this time be used to discuss strategies with the other members of your nation's forces.
12043 : Players will be forbidden from using any items they bring to the battlefield. Only temporary items that are quarried may be used. A total of fifteen temporary items (though only one of each type) can be carried.
12044 : When this rule is in effect, all players will be presented with five complimentary temporary items at the beginning of the match.
12045 : For more information on temporary items, refer to the special rules.
12046 : After being KO'd, if a player chooses to be revived at the spot he was defeated, 100% of all HP and 50% of all MP will be restored. In addition, the player will maintain 50% of the TP he had earned.
12047 : If a player chooses to return to their force's camp, HP and MP will be fully restored, but all TP will be lost.
12048 : Please note that many of the rules previously considered special have been fully implemented. Also, several new special rules have been added.
12049 : Learn about which special rules? Temporary items. Ballista Points. Scoring restrictions. Gate Breach radius expansion. Resistance to Sleep. Open entries. Minimum level restrictions. Re-entry restrictions. Participant & Rook numbers. Experience Points. Return.
12050 : Previously, participants in Ballista were required to use an item the moment they dug it up using the /quarry command. However, players can now stock these items as temporary items for use at any time during the match.
12051 : Players can hold up to ten temporary items, but only one of each type. If a player finds an item that they already possess, they must use it immediately or throw it away.
12052 : If players who possess ten temporary items find an item that they have not already obtained, they will also have the option to exchange it with one of their current items.
12053 : Also, players will not, at any time, be allowed to trade temporary items. However, there are items that can be used on other Ballista participants. Please note that players may not be able to use these special items as soon as they are quarried.
12054 : Finally, the Heralds will collect temporary items when the match (the third in a Best of Three series) has concluded.
12055 : Ballista Points are rewarded to each competitor based on his or her performance in a single Ballista match. The maximum number of points that can be accumulated per match is #.
12056 : While it is taken into consideration, scoring Petras is not the only way to earn Ballista Points. Assisting allies and defeating members of the enemy forces can also earn a high score.
12057 : Ballista Points can be traded for special vouchers, which may be exchanged for free temporary items at the start of new matches.
12058 : However, remember that depending on the level restriction of the match, certain vouchers will not be redeemed at the beginning of a match. Speak with a Marshal directly after a match to register your points.
12059 : Players will only be allowed to score up to five Petras at a time. Also, a player's Gate Breach status will be automatically disengaged if a Petra is not scored within a certain amount of time. The amount of time is increased for those members of the team currently behind in points.
12060 : All allies within a certain radius will achieve Gate Breach status when a member of the enemy forces is defeated.
12061 : Players' resistance to sleep will be increased.
12062 : During the entry period, from #:, all adventurers will be allowed to join the forces with the smallest number of participants, regardless of allegiance. Open entries will be accepted until both sides have reached maximum capacity.
12063 : In order to ensure balanced matches, the following level limits are enforced: Level 30 matches: 130
12064 : Level 40 matches: 3140 Level 50 matches: 4150 Level 60 matches: 5160 Unrestricted matches: 61
12065 : Please note that any participant who cancels his or her registration will not be allowed to re-apply for the same match.
12066 : When the total number of participants in a match is less than 40, the location of the two camps will be adjusted. Also in this case, the number of Rooks will be reduced to two.
12067 : Any adventurer whose main level is over 30 will receive EXP for participating in a Ballista match. However, no EXP will be rewarded if the adventurer fails to actively take part in the match.
12068 : Read which chapter on B.P. Ranking? Basic Information. Registering Points. Rewards. Chevron & Title List. None.
12069 : Ballista Point Ranking is based upon all Ballista Points registered from the past ten matches in each of the three participating battle areas.
12070 : Anyone who wishes to take part in the ranking needs to register [his/her] points within four hours (Vana'diel time) from the end of the previous match.
12071 : After the registration period ends, players can compare their record with those of the previous nine matches.
12072 : If, at any time, a player ranks in the top ten (overall) or first for a specific job, [he/she] will have the opportunity to receive a special chevron as well as a new title.
12073 : There are four types of chevrons and titles awarded to top-ten players (gold/mythril/silver/bronze), as well as twenty different types awarded for outstanding performances by players of each of the twenty jobs.
12074 : Wearing a chevron during a Ballista match will automatically change a player's current title. If a player wishes to possess this title after a match as well, [he/she] must contact a certain bard in San d'Oria.
12075 : Also, while wearing a chevron, players will be able to trade Ballista Points for temporary items not available to all players.
12076 : However, the rules of Ballista state that players may only possess a certain chevron for no longer than one half Vana'diel year. When that time comes, they are required to return the chevron before being allowed to participate in any further matches.
12077 : Finally, checking someone during a Ballista match will display the total number of chevrons that person has accumulated to date.
12078 : View which chevron/title? 1st (overall). 2nd (overall). 3rd (overall). 4th-10th (overall). 1st (warrior). 1st (monk). 1st (white mage). 1st (black mage). 1st (red mage). 1st (thief). 1st (paladin). 1st (dark knight). 1st (beastmaster). 1st (bard). 1st (ranger). 1st (samurai). 1st (ninja). 1st (dragoon). 1st (summoner). 1st (blue mage). 1st (corsair). 1st (puppetmaster). 1st (dancer). 1st (scholar). 1st (geomancer). 1st (rune fencer).

12121 : I'm a traveling Moogle, always on the road... In search of the secrets of true strength, kupo.
12122 : And this time I think I might have found one. That's why I'm visiting Maat to see what he thinks, kupo.
12123 : I could fill you in on the details, but you don't look like you'd understand what I have to say. Come back when you think you've got some more seasoning under your belt, kupo...
12124 : I've discovered a way to increase the potential of those who have reached their limits. However, I haven't found anyone to pass that method on to, kupo. Hey, you look pretty tough. How would you like to be my guinea...errr, assistant?
12125 : Wait a minute! I remember you! I already filled you in on the secrets of the Moogle Merit Management system, kupo! Stop wasting your time here; get fighting, kupo!
12126 : Become his assistant? Let's do it! No way! Tell me more...
12127 : Excellent, kupo... Ahem! I shall now pass on to you the secrets of the Moogle Merit Management system. Use this legendary method to extend your limits. Watch as your strength soars beyond the stars, kupo!
12128 : Now, when the level of your main job has reached 75 or higher, a new button, Merit Points, will appear under Status in the main menu.
12129 : Press this button to change experience accumulation modes as well as adjust skills and attributes. Just remember, you can only adjust your attributes while in your Mog House or Mog Garden, kupo!
12130 : casts a strange spell on you...
12131 : Hmmm... That didn't work, kupo... I guess I still have some research to do. We'll have to put the experiment on hold for a while.
12132 : Huh? What good is an adventurer that's not willing to take on a little adventure? Well, come back to me if you ever change your mind, kupo...
12133 : Been working hard, or hardly working, kupo? Remember that by pressing the Merit Points button in the Status menu, you can check merit point totals, change experience accumulation modes, and adjust skills and attributes.
12134 : Oho, kupo! Or perhaps you're looking to transcend your limits? Because that could also be arranged...
12135 : Ask about merit points? Yes. No.
12136 : What will you ask about? Exceeding your limits. Merit points. Nothing.
12137 : Well, if you ever need a refresher, you know where I'll be, kupo!
12138 : Or perhaps you've finally mustered the courage to conquer your inner limits, kupo?
12139 : Before you rush into anything, let me inform you of the disclaim...errr, the details of the method, kupo. Have you ever stopped to wonder what happens to all the experience you accumulate after maxing out your level?
12140 : In recent months, I have discovered that this type of experience builds up in your body in a completely different form--a type of super experience, if you will. I have given this phenomenon the name limit points, kupo!
12141 : When you accumulate ten thousand of these points, they are magically transformed into an even more super type of experience--super-duper experience, if you will. I call these ultra-special points merit points, kupo!
12142 : But that is not all I have discovered. I think I have also come across a method to manage those points and use them to boost the levels of your body and mind beyond their current limits! I call it Moogle Merit Management, kupo!
12143 : I can tell by the look on your face that you're pretty interested, kupo. So, what would you like to know?
12144 : Ask about... How to accumulate merit points. How to adjust attributes. Nothing at this time.
12145 : Well, you already know that by reaching level 75 you're ready to start collecting limit points, right, kupo?
12146 : Well, before you begin, don't forget that you have to press the Merit Points button in the Status menu.
12147 : It only appears when your main job is level 75 or higher, kupo.
12148 : By pressing this button, you can toggle between experience point accumulation mode and limit point accumulation mode, kupo.
12149 : In experience point accumulation mode, you will gain normal EXP after every battle until you reach the maximum...
12150 : ...while in limit point accumulation mode, you will receive limit points after every battle. It's that easy, kupo!
12151 : Oh, and by the way--if you are still in experience point accumulation mode after you've reached your maximum amount of EXP, any battles fought from that moment on will earn you limit points, regardless of the mode you are in, kupo!
12152 : Normally, you can only accumulate limit points when you're playing a job that has reached level 75 or higher. However, there is one exception, kupo!
12153 : When a job capable of receiving limit points has been reduced via a level restriction, you can still earn limit points by defeating enemies!
12154 : Just don't forget to switch modes before heading out on a hunting trip! When you're in limit point accumulation mode, the color of the text in the Status window will change a little to let you know, kupo!
12155 : Finally, if you level down or switch jobs while in limit point accumulation mode, you will automatically be switched back to experience point accumulation mode.
12156 : Ah, and one more point of advice: You can always check the amount of limit points and merit points you have earned by viewing the Merit Point menu.
12157 : Ummm, first of all, you can check the number of merit points you have accumulated by pressing the Merit Points button under Status in the main menu.
12158 : The data I have collected so far tells me that it is quite difficult to raise these attributes, and that there seems to be a limit to the amount any certain attribute can be boosted, kupo.
12159 : It also seems that certain attributes and skills are connected in some way. I call these groups categories.
12160 : For example, imagine the attributes in the HP/MP category can be raised a combination of seven times, kupo.
12161 : That means if you raise your Max HP five times, you can only raise your Max MP two times.
12162 : In other words, you cannot raise all of the attributes to their limits. The body must maintain a certain balance, or it will explode! Or something like that, kupo.
12163 : There is also a way to lower attributes that have been pushed past their limits. Unfortunately, every time this is tried, the merit points used to originally raise that attribute are lost, kupo...
12164 : Oh, and finally, there are some attributes and skills in the same category that have different limits. I'm still not sure about all of these, so I'd suggest asking some of your level 75 buddies for advice, kupo!
12165 : Hrm? Hmmm... I need a little time alone to think... Would you mind coming back a little later, kupo?
12166 : 0:#     4:# 1:#     5:# 2:#     6:# 3:#     7:#
12167 : I had a feeling that's what you'd say, kupo! Well, Maat? How about it?
12168 : We stand on the cusp of a new era. It's the Goddess-given duty of an old warrior like me to prepare the younger generation to follow in my footsteps. And who better than a young [man/woman] who's met every challenge sent [his/her] way?
12169 : You can say that again, my friend!
12170 : No doubt you've heard of the mog tablets--those stone slabs engraved with the timeless wisdom of King Kupofried the Great that have been popping up periodically throughout the land.
12171 : The tablets hold many secrets that we moogles have yet to unravel, kupo. Why are our wings purple? Why are our noses red? How can we better assist our adventuring friends?
12172 : Why, I was just having a discussion with a friend of mine from the Magian Mooglehood on the very subject... That's when it hit me on the head like a herd of hecteyes!
12173 : What if the ancient moogle arts could be used to augment not only adventurers' possessions, but the adventurers themselves, kupo!?
12174 : Using my knowledge of merit points--and drawing upon the martial mastery of Maat here--I've whipped up a method that just might work! What say you, adventurer? Care to be my test subject?
12175 : 'Course, nobody'd blame you for not trustin' the little devil. I'm not even sure I do. Heh heh heh...
12176 : Is an adventurer who would spurn greater strength truly an adventurer? Come, now! What have you got to lose, kupo?
12177 : Give it a go, kupo? Will I ever! Not today.
12178 : Marvelous! Magnificent! First, I'll need you to bring me # %.
12179 : They're needed to channel the ancient moogle magic, you see. You'll also have to accumulate # merit point[/s] to provide the necessary energy to trigger the reaction, kupo.
12180 : I'll be sittin' this one out, I fear. I may have mastered the martial arts, but I know better than to get mixed up with moogle mumbo-jumbo. Heh heh heh... Now go get 'em!
12181 : Say it ain't so, kupo! Ah, but it is not a moogle's place to question the judgment of an accomplished adventurer such as yourself. Come back if you ever have a change of heart.
12182 : Have you acquired the # % and # merit point[/s] needed to transcend your limits, kupo?
12183 : If so, then trade me the # % and we'll be on our way! My wings are aflutter with anticipation!
12184 : Or did you just drop by to hear about merit points, kupo?
12185 : The ancient moogle incantation requires # % and # merit point[/s], kupo.
12186 : Spectacular! Stupendous! Let's get started, shall we? If you'll just excuse me for a moment, kupo...
12187 : Yoo-hoooooo! Mister Magian Moogle man! Yes, you! Over here!
12188 : What is it this time? And you'd do well to adopt a more courteous tone when addressing your elders, kupo...
12189 : I'd call you by your proper name if you'd actually tell anyone what it is! But nooo, the Magian Mooglehood must ever be shrouded in secrecy, kupo...
12190 : You would make mock of the wisdom of your forefathers, kupo!?
12191 : (I've a mind to ku-pound the both of them into the next millennium if they don't settle down...)
12192 : Anyhow, if you would just crouch down right here, kupo...
12193 : <Mumble, grumble>... I am ready, kupo.
12194 : Excellent! Our magian friend here will fire a potent dose of moogle magic directly at you. All you have to do, my dear adventurer, is stay alive! Easy breezy, wouldn't you say, kupo?
12195 : Now, kupo!
12196 : (This is reckless even for these moogles. Sends a shiver up my spine, it does...)
12197 : % feels a sudden surge of power well up from the pit of [his/her] stomach, coursing through [his/her] veins and limbs...!
12198 : Kupo-ho! It would seem the procedure has gone off precisely as we predicted!
12199 : That it has, kupo. I must say, the sheer stamina of these adventurers never ceases to astound me.
12200 : My friend, you've been the perfect test subject...<ahem>...I mean, you are clearly an ideal heir for the powers of the moogle ancients. Should our research bear further fruit, you shall be among the first to know!
12201 : But why are you still standing around here? There's a whole new world waiting for you to explore, kupo!
12202 : Your level limit is now 80!
12203 : Let me guess, kupo. You have caught word of my latest miraculous method for padding the already-puissant powers of adventurers like yourself.
12204 : Yes, the positively esurient expression on your face tells me all I need know.
12205 : Is there no point at which your penchant for power will be sated, kupo?
12206 : It cannot be easy, walking around as a veritable avatar of avarice and avidity.
12207 : Still, I've taken a liking to your kind, kupo. And since you were such a wonderful guinea pig last time, I'd be positively elated to experiment upon you again!
12208 : That said, I must warn you that I'm still working out some of the kinks. I can give you no guarantees this time.
12209 : That is to say, don't come crying to me if your level of strength ends up plunging precipitously, kupo!
12210 : Are you still keen for the challenge?
12211 : Give it a go, kupo? Will I ever! On second thought...
12212 : Ever the confident one, I see. Very well! Go procure the # % needed for the procedure...
12213 : ...And store your spiritual energies to the tune of # merit [point/points], and we'll give it a go, kupo!
12214 : You sure you want to go ahead with this, %? This moogle mumbo-jumbo gets sketchier and sketchier each time, if you ask me.
12215 : Is that so? Very well. I cannot fault you for exercising a modicum of moderation, kupo.
12216 : Have you acquired the # % and # merit point[/s] needed to transcend your limits?
12217 : Then trade them to me and we shall begin the festivities, kupo!
12218 : Or did you just drop by to ask me about merit points? Because I would be happy to oblige, kupo.
12219 : My latest marvel of moogle magic requires # % and # merit point[/s], kupo.
12220 : Splendid! Superlative! In that case, without further ado...
12221 : Yoo-hoooooo! Mister Magian Moogle man! Over here, kupo!
12222 : Yes, yes... I'm coming already. And keep your voice down, will you? I could hear your hooting and hollering from a malm away, kupo...
12223 : (Seems the poor fella's resigned himself to his fate...)
12224 : Same deal as last time. Got it, kupo? And today, we'll also be recruiting the services of a very special guest!
12225 : Howdy-ho, fatty-watties!
12226 : Ladies and gentlemoogles, I proudly present Parike-Poranke, esteemed researcher of enterological magic from the Windurstian Orastery, who was kind enough to take time away from his data-gathering for this especial occasion, kupo!
12227 : (Parike-Poranke? The self-styled brown mage? Why do I get the feelin' we're in for a real mess this time...?)
12228 : Honored to be here, my pudgy purple-winged friends!
12229 : I've been hopin' to test out my latest laxative spell, but lately my lab's been as barren as a set of freshly evacuated bowels. This is just the belly-bursting opportunity I've been looking for!
12230 : ...Ahem. To make room for a fresh fount of power inside you, we must first expel the old. A simple truth, no, kupo?
12231 : (Ulp... My stomach's gettin' queasy just thinkin' about it.)
12232 : ...
12233 : ...Very well. Come and kneel down right before me, %... Parike-Poranke, you may take your position over there.
12234 : Alright!!! Prepare to have your innards turned inside out!
12235 : And you, my friend, prepare to unleash the most vigorous volley of moogle magic you can manage, kupo.
12236 : ...Understood. I am ready whenever the rest of you are.
12237 : Then let us begin! (Gee, I sure hope this works, kupo...)
12238 : Bulging...belly...! (Was that it...? Bah, never mind!)
12239 : BURST!!!!!!
12240 : % is racked with pain as [his/her] stomach gurgles and grumbles violently!
12241 : Now! Now, kupo!
12242 : % feels a gushing fount of power explode from [his/her] bowels, coursing through [his/her] veins and limbs...!
12243 : Success! Ahahaha, glorious success!!! The last time I tried that one, I was scrubbing my lab clean for a month!
12244 : (I don't know who's more frightening, this fellow or the moogle who brought him here...)
12245 : (How curious. The more excruciating the pain they endure, the stronger these adventurers grow. Perhaps my trials are not as torturous as they should be...?)
12246 : Ahem...er, nothing. Nothing at all! You look in fine fettle, my adventuring friend. Go out there and get 'em! Farewell, kupo!
12247 : I can't thank you enough! Why, you've given me enough data to write a year's worth of reports. Next time you're feeling a little backy-wacked up, you know who to call! Ta-taru!
12248 : Rejoice, %, for the procedure was a staggering success!
12249 : Whole new horizons await you out there, and I suspect you're feeling famished. Go and feast to your heart's content!
12250 : Your level limit is now 85!
12251 : Great King Kupofried's ghost! Look who's back, and right on schedule. However do you always know when to come here, kupo?
12252 : We inflict upon you progressively more profound pain each time, and still you come back for more. Are you perhaps a practitioner of a certain Far Eastern religious discipline?
12253 : Or perhaps you were simply dropped on your head as a child. Yes, that seems the more likely answer.
12254 : But hey, it's your bruised and battered body, not mine, kupo.
12255 : Either way, you'll be pleased to know that the previous two experiments are going to feel like child's play compared to what we have in store for you this time.
12256 : And though you'll indubitably ignore me, it's my duty to warn you. There's no guarantee things will go as smoothly as last time, kupo.
12257 : If you ask me, you're lucky that crazy moogle magic ever worked. I'd think twice about this if I were you...
12258 : So how about it, kupo?
12259 : Test your limits? Of course! On second thought...
12260 : How did I know you'd say that?  Very well. To power the process this time, we'll be needing # %.
12261 : And you'll need to prime your own physical energies by storing up # merit point[/s]. No exceptions, kupo.
12262 : I've got a bad feeling about this...
12263 : Taking a pass today, are we? Fine with me. No fur off my back, kupo.
12264 : Phew... That's a relief.
12265 : [He/She]'s back! Are you ready with the # % and # merit point[/s] that we need?
12266 : If so, trade the # % to me and we'll get this show on the road, kupo.
12267 : Or did you come to hear me talk about merit points? Because I can do that too, kupo.
12268 : I'm afraid your physical energies are not sufficiently primed. Remember, you need # % and # merit point[/s] if you want to test your limits.
12269 : Well, it looks like you're all ready. And if you're ready, why, I'm more than ready. <Ahem>... Yoo-hoooooo, kupoooooo!
12270 : What's this? Has our guest of honor stood us up? For shame, kupo!
12271 : Ah, well. We still have plenty of firepower at our disposal here. Let's get the ritual rolling...
12272 : ...Oh, how I've waited for this day! Hah! Yah!
12273 : !?
12274 : Ten years. Ten long years I walked through fire and ice, subjected my body and mind to the harshest of trainin'. All for the day--the glorious day--when I could settle the score with you. Maat...prepare yourself!
12275 : What!? M-me?
12276 : Oh, do forgive me, Mister Degenhard. I neglected to notify you that % here would be your opponent today.
12277 : Maat... I face my battles with honor. The battle garb I wear is proof enough of that.
12278 : I thought you a worthy opponent, and yet you summon me all the way to Jeuno on some cruel jest? In all my long years, I have never suffered such dishonor!
12279 : For this, you will get no mercy from me! No mercy!!!
12280 : Wait a minute, old friend! What is this talk of settling scores? Why, I never--
12281 : Hah! Do not play the fool, Maat! It was written plain as day on your letter of challenge. If you think yourself worthy of wearing %, you must defeat me in single combat!
12282 : (Whoever could have penned such a preposterous missive? Oh, that's right...it was me, kupo!)
12283 : You break your promise, now I break you! Like you break your promise. Hieeeeee-yah!
12284 : W-wait, Degenhard. This...this is madness!
12285 : Oh, good gracious me, %! He's preparing to come at Maat with every technique both in and out of the book, kupo!
12286 : If Maat doesn't unleash his own ultimate moves, he's as good as done for! We must help him, %!
12287 : Look closely at the two masters, kupo. See how they each emit an aura? That's a sign that a no-holds-barred showdown between techniques of inconceivable power is on the way!
12288 : There are three types of auras, indicating three of the most advanced, awe-inspiring bushin techniques. But here's the key, kupo: though they are equal in power, each technique is ascendant over another.
12289 : The Raging Beast devours the Silent Wind, but is quelled by the Soaring Dragon, kupo.
12290 : The Silent Wind swallows up the Soaring Dragon, but is quelled by the Raging Beast, kupo.
12291 : The Soaring Dragon devours the Raging Beast, but is swallowed up by the Silent Wind, kupo.
12292 : We are dealing with two martial arts masters here, kupo. An attack from an equal or inferior position will be easily deflected by the opponent.
12293 : Only by assuming a position of advantage will the attacker be able to break his opponent's defenses!
12294 : Now, are you ready, kupo!?
12295 : Ready, kupo!? Heeeeee-yah!!! W-wait a minute...!
12296 : I don't know how long I can hold them... Hurry back soon, kupo!
12297 : Are you two done yappin'? Then prepare to die, coward! Hah! Eeeeee-yaaaaaah!
12298 : Help Maat, kupo! Assess the situation. Attack with the Raging Beast! Attack with the Silent Wind! Attack with the Soaring Dragon! Review techniques. ---- Auto-hit with Raging Beast Auto-hit with Silent Wind Auto-hit with Soaring Dragon Auto-fail with Raging Beast Auto-fail with Silent Wind Auto-fail with Soaring Dragon Draw with Raging Beast Draw with Silent Wind Draw with Soaring Dragon
12299 : [Maat/Degenhard] unleashes the [Raging Beast/Silent Wind/Soaring Dragon]! [Maat/Degenhard]'s fist glows [red/blue/green] with power...
12300 : [Was this it!?/Hee-yah!/Take that!]
12301 : [Grrr...!/Yah!/Ungh!]
12302 : [Die, coward!/Hieeee-hah!/Yieeeeee!]
12303 : [Owowowow!/Yaaaaaah!/Hurk...!]
12304 : [Maat/Degenhard]'s eyes flicker with a murderous gleam!
12305 : [How about this!?/Can you withstand this?/There's no holding back this time!/Say your prayers!/Now you will see...I am still the master!]
12306 : [Take this!/You're no match for me!/I'm just getting warmed up!/Die in dishonor!/This is the end for you...old friend.]
12307 : Maat uses [Combo/One Inch Punch/Howling Fist/Asuran Fists/Bear Killer]!
12308 : Degenhard uses [Combo/One Inch Punch/Howling Fist/Asuran Fists/Meteoric Kick]!
12309 : Urk...! Bah...this battle's just begun.
12310 : Unghhh...I'll never fall to a coward like you! Hah! Yah! Eeeeee-yah!
12311 : Ow! Owowowowow! What's the big idea!?
12312 : Ungh...you've learned a trick or two. But as long as you give yourself over to petty rage...you'll never defeat me!
12313 : Hah! Why do you still hold back? Show me the full extent of your strength!
12314 : You have learned...well... But this isn't...over...yet...!
12315 : [Maat/Degenhard] has barely broken a sweat.
12316 : [Maat/Degenhard] is bearing down for the fight.
12317 : [Maat/Degenhard] is beginning to breathe heavily.
12318 : [Maat/Degenhard]'s breathing is badly labored.
12319 : [Maat/Degenhard] is on his last legs...
12320 : You've given me the first good fight I've had in years. I'm impressed, old friend.
12321 : Hahaha! Is it such a surprise? I've trained years for this day!
12322 : That's the spirit! Well...now that I've gotten warmed up, what say we go another round?
12323 : Ahahaha! Taken a few too many blows to the head, I see! Hah! If you're so eager to meet your maker, how can I refuse!? Heeeeee-yah!
12324 : What's this? They're not done yet, kupo!? Oh, %, what shall we do!?
12325 : ...Urrrgggh.
12326 : You haven't changed a bit, friend. All passion, no discipline.
12327 : Now settle down and listen for once. Your opponent today isn't me, but this adventurer here.
12328 : Preposterous! This rank amateur--?
12329 : This amateur seeks to take [his/her] powers to a new level. And for that, [he/she] and our purple-winged friend here have need of your strength.
12330 : R-ridiculous... So the challenge letter...and the %! It was all some moogle farce?
12331 : Hee hee, kupo.
12332 : (It would seem that this nomad fellow is shrewder than he lets on, kupo.)
12333 : <Ahem> Sorry to keep you waiting, %. Now that all of our participants are properly warmed up, what say we get things started, kupo?
12334 : Everyone! To your positions, kupo!
12335 : Now this is the momentaru I've been waiting for!
12336 : ...
12337 : Hm?
12338 : Oh dear... Has my moogle magic failed me, kupo?
12339 : Oh...!
12340 : [He's/She's]...
12341 : What indomitable, indefatigable spirit, kupo!
12342 : Hm!?
12343 : % feels a vast wellspring of life energy gush forth from deep within!
12344 : Incredible! These adventurers can endure even more punishment than we predicted. The Mooglehood will be positively ecstatic to hear of this, kupo!
12345 : Hmph. I prefer trainin' the old-fashioned way.
12346 : Simply-wimply stupendous! I must reportaru my findings at once!
12347 : %. That was close. Too close, kupo. My moogle magic may have finally reached its limits. I can make no promises that next time will go as smoothly...
12348 : But that is a worry for another day. Now go forth! A veritable universe of unbounded possibilities awaits you, kupo!
12349 : Your level limit is now 90!
12350 : Debug: Battle preparations.
12351 : Debug: Battle part.
12352 : Battle part: Success part. Failure part.
12353 : Battle clear part.
12354 : Battle failure part.
12355 : Drat! Drat and darnation, kupo!
12356 : Seems our friend's been held up. Heh heh heh...
12357 : %. I applaud your ardent ambition, but I fear our preparations have been prolonged. We await the arrival of a very important visitor from a certain super-secret syndicate, you see...
12358 : Howdy-wowdy-ho! I hear some scruffy moogle was just begging-wegging for me to come by? We need to make this quick--a bevy of busty beauties just checked in to Neptune's Spire, and they're desperataruly in need of my services.
12359 : !?
12360 : Atori-Tutori winks knowingly in Maat's direction.
12361 : Ahem! I am the scruffy moogle who sent for you! They say you possess a secret Far Eastern technique that allows adventurers to--how shall we say it?--relieve themselves of their corporeal confines, kupo.
12362 : Yeppers, that's me alrightaru. So where's my victim--I mean, trainee--for today?
12363 : Why, this strapping adventurer right here. (That's your cue, %!)
12364 : Atori-Tutori squints his eyes and looks % up and down.
12365 : Hmm, not bad. Not bad at all! You must work outaru!
12366 : ...But wait a minute. Of course! You've grown so strong I scarcely-warcely recognized you! Why, I knew greataru things would come of you!
12367 : Very well! You're as good a subject as any for my chic, unique technique.
12368 : But first, a matter of procedure. As there may be a few minor risks involved, I'll have to ask you to sign a simple contractaru. Do that, and I'll pump up your powers with a minimum of fussy-wuss.
12369 : A contract? It couldn't be...
12370 : So what's the good word, %? Are you ready to sign a contractaru with me and become a magical g--er, a mightier, more majestic adventurer?
12371 : How aboutaru it? Sign me up! Maybe lataru.
12372 : Got butterflies in your belly, kupo? I'll be hanging out here should you ever have a change of heart.
12373 : Oh, [he'll/she'll] be back. You can countaru on it.
12374 : Look who's back! Well, kupo? Have you decided to take our Tarutaru friend up on his offer?
12375 : What say you, kupo? Sign me up! About merit points... Goodbye.
12376 : Now that's the answer I was looking for! Very well, then! I'll just be needing a few things from you. % and %, to startaru. Ah yes, and a healthy-wealthy dose of intestinal fortitude.
12377 : Intestinal fortitude, kupo...? That's an awfully ambiguous order, my diminutive friend.
12378 : One would think you'd have a bit more imagination in that swollen-wollen head of yours. I speak, of course, of the marinara points you always requestaru of these adventurers.
12379 : Ah, mouthwatering morsels of select seafood and pasta boiled to perfection...! ...Ahem. Do you perhaps speak of merit points?
12380 : Hmm? As I was saying, # of those whatchama-pointarus along with the items of which I just spoke. Round these up, and our contract is as good as signed--and I won't even need to take your soul. Ahem, I mean, we'll be ready to roll.
12381 : And with that, I'm going back to the inn before the vixens vacate! Drop a linkshell line to my assistantaru when this [fellow/lady] is ready, mister moogle man.
12382 : Far be it from me to keep you from your destiny, %, but this technique the Tarutaru speaks of...
12383 : Ah, but never ye mind...just an old man's worries. Trust your heart and follow your own path. It won't lead you astray.
12384 : To recap, you'll be needing %, %, and # marinara--I mean merit [point/points].
12385 : Bring these to me, and I'll contact the miniature master. Understood, kupo?
12386 : Why yes, that should be everything. Now where did I put my linkshell, kupo...?
12387 : ...
12388 : Curses and criminy, late again! Does that Taru's disregard for decorum know no bounds!?
12389 : Heh, speak o' the devil. And don't look now, but he's brought a friend...
12390 : Hmph! And give me justaru one good reason why your associates won't help sell my scrumptious %!
12391 : I could give you a thousand-wousand reasons, my dear, but what would be the pointaru? The higher-ups would never listen to a second-string flunky like me!
12392 : And would it kill you to try to negotiataru!? After all the time you've spent there, surely you know how to deal with those costive-wostive easterners!
12393 : And what's in it for me? Hmmm? Why, I don't even like pickles! Yeech!
12394 : Ah, the tragedy of it all! It's common knowledge that the pickle-hater misses out on at least eighty percentaru of life's pleasures!
12395 : Ah, but the remaining twenty percent tastes infinitely as sweetaru, untainted by the sour, unsavory flavor of those foul foodstuffs!
12396 : I, for one, am developing an exceedingly unpleasant taste in my mouth just listening to this pointless palaver. Is this young lady your assistant, kupo?
12397 : Ah, forgive me. This is Chumbawumba, a purveyor of pickle-wickles who--as you can see--is most desperataru to distribute her wares.
12398 : That's Chamama! And I'll have you know that I run a perfectly reputable restaurantaru!
12399 : But my assistant...yes, of course! How's this, Ms. Chulapalooza? You lend me a hand, and I'll see if I can't talky-walky the boss into selling your rancid rations.
12400 : That's Chamama! And rancid...! ...W-wait. You'd do that for me?
12401 : Of course, my dear assistant! Now step rightaru this way, won't you?
12402 : Something about this is tying my sensitive stomach in knots, kupo...
12403 : %, listen well. My ancient Eastern technique will trigger a miracu-waculous process inside your body. You might feel a bit odd at first, but pay it no mind.
12404 : Incubate it carefully, and then, when the urge calls, I want you to squeeze with all your mightaru! Succeed and you will expel the physical embodiment of the profound life energies that lie dormantaru within you.
12405 : It's all in the timing. Ten beats of your heart--ten seconds--should do the trick. Discharge it too early and it will disintegrate into dustaru. Wait too long and we'll have a foul mass as rotten-wotten as Chupawupa's pickled rodent tails.
12406 : Hmm? Discharge what? No need to sweataru the details, friend! Anyhoodles, as a final step, my lovely-wovely assistant will weigh your, er, evacuated matter. I daresay three pickling stones' weight would do just perfectly.
12407 : Well, aren't you in luck! I have a supply of % right here.
12408 : Perfect! Now remember, %. It's all in the mind. When you make that all-important push, envision something...cutesy-wutesy. %, for example.
12409 : Cutesy-wutesy...?
12410 : I recommend you take a momentaru to catch your breath, %. When you're ready, just speak to our frizzy-furred friend here, okay?
12411 : Ready? Come again? Ready! Maybe another time.
12412 : Well, look who's back. Ready to give my technique a shot, %?
12413 : Splendid! I shall signal the start of the procedure, kupo.
12414 : All rightaru, %! On our moogle friend's mark...!
12415 : Here we go, kupo!
12416 : When you get the urge... Push!
12417 : ...
12418 : ...?
12419 : A discolored mass is released from %'s body. It quickly decomposes and dribbles off....
12420 : Eew! Stinky-winky, %. I told you what would happen if you waited too long.
12421 : Something begins to poke out from %'s body. It quickly crumbles and dissipates into the air...
12422 : No, no, %! Weren't you listening-wistening? You must hold it in longer!
12423 : A curious mass is released from %'s body...
12424 : Well, well...this looks most promising indeed! Ms. Picklemonger, the weigh-in!
12425 : That's Cha... Oh, just let me see that already!
12426 : One stone, two. Yes, it looks like we have...
12427 : Oh dearie-wearie me. I'm afraid it's just a trifle-wifle too light.
12428 : Let's see, now. Heave...ho!
12429 : Oh, heavens no. This is simply-wimply too heavy for an exquisitaru lady like myself to carry.
12430 : No, this won't do at all. Once more from the beginning!
12431 : The unidentified mass vanishes.
12432 : Just what was that strange stone, kupo...?
12433 : Ugh! I thought this was difficult to do, but it's even more difficult to watch!
12434 : Well, %? I'm ready-weady when you are!
12435 : Could it be? Yes, I think it could! Three stones' weight and not an onz more!
12436 : [He's/She's] done it! To think I'd live to see the day...
12437 : This sleek oblong shape, this glossy sheen! I'm simply-wimply smitten!
12438 : And just what is % supposed to do now!? King Kupofried forbid, you can't expect [him/her] to...eat it!?
12439 : Oh, good heavens no! This is where I unleash my final technique, just like so...
12440 : The unidentified mass transformed into a shimmering crystal!
12441 : Congratulations, %. You have tapped into a power that few mortal-wortals have.
12442 : Atori-Tutori hands the % to %.
12443 : Keep this stone close at hand for the rest of your days. As for the nature of its powers... I'll just leave that to your imagination.
12444 : Are we done here? I've got pecks of pickled rarab tails to sell, and I'm not getting any younger!
12445 : Very well. Let it not be said that Atori-Tutori doesn't keep a promise. May we meet again, %. Ta-taru!
12446 : Atori-Tutori winks knowingly in %'s direction.
12447 : Whatever is the matter, Maat? You're looking positively pale, kupo...
12448 : It's nothin'. Nothing at all, I say... Urgh, I think I've lost my appetite...
12449 : %. Only the terminal trial awaits you now. I suspect we shall meet again before long, kupo.
12450 : Your level limit is now 95!
12451 : I have a letter for you here from none other than Atori-Tutori. It reads, ahem...
12452 : Howdy, %. How's my favorite indentured servantaru doing these days?
12453 : Having fun with your %? Well, you're in luck, because your master has another treat for you today.
12454 : First, though, I'll be needing something from you: %, to be exact. Track one down and trade it to our furry friend, here.
12455 : In return, I'll... Oh, but that would spoil all the fun, wouldn't it? Ta-taru for now!
12456 : A present! How positively fascinating...and frightening. Whatever could it be?
12457 : And the item he speaks of, kupo...
12458 : Heh heh. This would seem t' be a warm-up for your next trial, %. I reckon you'll be able to find what ye seek from any enemy that's at least an even match for ye, if ye know what I mean.
12459 : Anyhow, we'll be waiting for you here. Happy hunting, %!
12460 : Shall I read Atori-Tutori's letter again, kupo?
12461 : Read the letter? Please do. No need.
12462 : %... Yes, this should do!
12463 : Did you face any problems procuring it, kupo?
12464 : Atori-Tutori's been waiting for quite some while, you see. He seemed a tad...testy, so do take care.
12465 : There you are, %. I was starting to think you had--Goddess forbid--forgotten the terms of our contractaru.
12466 : I trust you still have your %? Hand it over, if you would.
12467 : Such a lovely shimmer and sheen. Yes, I reckon-weckon you're ready to face your ultimate challenge--me.
12468 : Or, how shall I say it...a part of me? After all, were I to unleash my full strength, I might mistakenly blastaru you into dust with an errant tap of my pinkie-winkie finger.
12469 : Accept the challenge? But of course! Maybe another time.
12470 : Don't tell me you're thinking of reneging on our contract, %. That would make me mostaru unhappy...and you don't want to see me unhappy.
12471 : I understand. These things take time. Friends and family to say farewells to, last will and testament to draftaru... Just don't keep me waiting for long.
12472 : Are you ready to meet your mak--er, your final challenge, kupo?
12473 : That's the spiritaru! Then prepare yourself and meet me at a suitable venue--Horlais Peak, Waughroon Shrine, Balga's Dais, or Qu'Bia Arena should suffice.
12474 : Toodle-woodles for now, my mangy confrere. Don't forget to furnish our friend here with the present I left for [him/her].
12475 : Consider yourself lucky, kupo! It's rare indeed that Atori-Tutori offers to go mano a mano with an adventurer like you.
12476 : ...
12477 : Maat? Is something the matter, kupo?
12478 : At long last, the time has come...
12479 : I can offer no advice but this, young one. Ready yourself in body and mind, and prepare for the fight of your life.
12480 : Kupopopo... What is this oppressively ominous mood? No siree, this simply won't do!
12481 : So here's some advice of my own. Find yourself some friends to bring to the battle, kupo!
12482 : Up to five shouldn't give that overconfident Taru cause to complain...much.
12483 : Oh, and %, don't forget this. It's a personal present from Atori-Tutori himself!
12484 : Word has it its energies will be released when paired with %.
12485 : Oh, and if you're looking for a lift, I can moogle-magick you to your final showdown in two shakes of a rarab's tail. What do you say?
12486 : Where to, kupo? Horlais Peak. Waughroon Shrine. Balga's Dais. Qu'Bia Arena. Nowhere yet.
12487 : Is that so? Then come back whenever you're ready, kupo.
12488 : Then away you go! It was nice knowing you, kupo!
12489 : Anyhow, if you're feelin' the butterflies before the battle o' your life, %, why don't you pay ol' Degenhard a visit?
12490 : Hah! Yah! Can't ye see I'm... Wait a minute. I almost didn't recognize ye...
12491 : Looks like someone's come a long way since our last meetin'. Why don't I give ye somethin' that might help in yer training?
12492 : But first, I'm gonna need proof that ye're ready. %, %, and % should do the trick.
12493 : Don't ye give me that face. It's trainin'--it ain't supposed to be easy!
12494 : Well, looks like someone's ready for [his/her] next challenge. As promised, here's somethin' for ya.
12495 : It's a present from our friend Chamama. As for how it's going to help yer trainin', ye've got me...
12496 : Kupopopo... Those bumps and bruises...don't tell me you failed, %?
12497 : Don't get too down and discouraged. Atori-Tutori is a formidable foe, after all. Fortunately, he's supplied me with % to spare!
12498 : However, I fear I can't offer them for free...
12499 : Atori-Tutori made me promise to exact a payment of # merit point[/s] or # ). He says it's part and parcel of your training, kupo.
12500 : Why, you already possess # merit point[/s], you say!? Would you like to use [it/them] right away?
12501 : Spend # merit point[/s]? Yes. No.
12502 : Whenever you're ready, I'll be here, kupo!
12503 : Excellent! # merit point[/s] paid, and the deal is done, kupo!
12504 : Splendid! # ), and the deal is done, kupo!
12505 : As promised, here's a spare % from my stock.
12506 : Will you be heading straight to the showdown?
12507 : Kupo-ho? Have we met, kupo?
12508 : Wait... Could it be? %...?
12509 : Ye've done it! Ye've truly done it!
12510 : Oh, %! I knew all along that if anyone could wipe the smirk off that self-satisfied Taru's face, it would be you!
12511 : Though I must confess some curiosity as to the conditions of that contractaru you signed, kupo...
12512 : Heh... If y' must know...
12513 : It involves bein' woken up at the crack o' dawn for sparrin' matches after doin' a hundred push-ups on your knuckles...
12514 : Eatin' all the rarab tails delivered to the Tenshodo from one of Atori-Tutori's acquaintances...
12515 : Wranglin' herds of wild sheep and countin' them one by one whenever he can't sleep...
12516 : ...'n much, much worse. Sends a shiver through these old bones just thinkin' about it...
12517 : Egads, kupo! That is a most appalling arrangement indeed!
12518 : Wait a minute. How is it that you're privy to all those particulars, Maat?
12519 : Hm!? R-rumors, that's all! When ye've been around as long as I have, ye hear a thing or two!
12520 : Anyway, enough talk! My daily trainin' regimen calls!
12521 : Come now, %. It's no time for slumping shoulders and sunk spirits.
12522 : After all, I'm sure it's all part of your training. Keep it up, and you'll be positively pulsating with power in no time flat!
12523 : You were right, old friend. I never thoughtaru [he'd/she'd] come this far...
12524 : That's my %. In all the time I've known [him/her], I've never once known [him/her] to back down from a challenge.
12525 : Why, when I think back to the days when [he/she] was still a rookie with more ambition 'n sense...
12526 : ...<Sniff>... That's odd, seems t' be some water in my eyes...
12527 : Save those tears, Maat.
12528 : While %'s achievements are admirable indeed, those adventurers who strive to reach the pinnacle of their powers remain few and far between.
12529 : We must not ease up on them. For it is in their hands that the fate of our Vana'diel lies...
12530 : Your level limit is now 99!
12531 : Speak of the [savior/starlet], kupo. I just overheard an earful of an engaging exhortation on job points and figured it was imperative that I inform you immediately!
12532 : Accomplished adventurers such as yourself can accrue these points by progressing prolifically in their professions. But beware, for the road is rockier than anything related to limit points, kupo.
12533 : ...However, I'm confident you'll conquer the cornucopia of crimps and clogs that could block your way to glory.
12534 : Do you believe you have what it takes? Without a doubt! Not at the moment...
12535 : That's what I wanted to hear, kupo! Your sheer determination fairly fills me with a fulgent felicity.
12536 : Henceforth, you shall be able to select Job Points under the Status menu as long as your main job has the reached the resplendent realm of level 99, kupo.
12537 : You can fervently fiddle with your faculties there, but only while inhabiting the interior of your Mog House or galavanting about your Mog Garden.
12538 : The  casts a strange and slightly unnerving spell upon you.
12539 : Hmph, and here I hypothesized you were brimming with boldness and bravery. Well, just talk to me when your gut gives you the go sign, kupo!
12540 : Those three stars shining above your head are indescribably inspiring, kupo!
12541 : And surely you seek more superlative strength!
12542 : How do you respond? Must have more power... I'm strong enough, thanks.
12543 : The trials and tribulations you must tackle are terrifying, kupo. Are you absolutely positive?
12544 : Are you positive? Beyond a doubt. Not if it's hard...
12545 : Then I shall bequeath to you a treasured tool--the master breaker!
12546 : With this, you will be able to advance in master levels for jobs you have mastered, kupo.
12547 : Only through battling the most boisterous baddies can you increase your master level.
12548 : Alas, I fear if you fall, your master level might similarly shrink, kupo.
12549 : You can check your current master level via the main menu if your main job is level 99 and you have reached job master status.
12550 : Increasing your master level will increase a variety of attributes, so do your best!
12551 : I will be waiting here whenever you are ready.
12552 : enchants you with a terrifying force.
12553 : %. What business do you have here today? If you seek Captain Wolfgang, he is currently...
12554 : You are here about the girl, Prishe? And the warrant for her arrest?
12555 : She presented herself at the palace of her own free will, not so long ago.
12556 : Naturally, she was taken into custody, but her demands for an audience with a higher authority are becoming increasingly vocal.
12557 : I wonder if Captain Wolfgang will return from his duties any time in the near future...
12558 : %!
12559 : I apologize for interrupting your conversation, but...could you walk with me for a moment?
12560 : Why would Prishe surrender herself so easily...?
12561 : I have no idea what she could be thinking.
12562 : Thank the mercy of Altana that Prishe has escaped any punishment while the Jeunoan government is occupied with other matters.
12563 : If we could only use this opportunity to rescue her somehow...
12564 : %! Lady Ulmia!
12565 : Tenzen!
12566 : I am glad to have found you. You have heard of young Lady Prishe's predicament?
12567 : We need to gather everyone together to unite our actions and plan our next move.
12568 : The rest of our friends are waiting in a tavern in Upper Jeuno.
12569 : A tavern in Upper Jeuno...?
12570 : Aldo has used his influence to secure the establishment for our exclusive use, if only for a short while.
12571 : I will await you on the premises. Until then.
12572 : What could be the purpose for this meeting being held at the Marble Bridge in Upper Jeuno?
12573 : If that Aldo is involved, I am positive it cannot be anything good. Just keep me out of it. If I lose this job, I'm through!
12574 : %.
12575 : I must apologize for my childish behavior. I never should have run off in such a flustered state.
12576 : I do understand what everyone is saying.
12577 : I understand that the Wyrmking, Bahamut, plans to obliterate all the peoples of Vana'diel.
12578 : Even with the might of the Jeuno Armada, many more innocent lives will be lost in this conflict if something is not done.
12579 : And I do understand that everyone truly wishes to rescue Prishe from her destiny...
12580 : However, it is as Lord Diabolos has said. We cannot save both the world and all of her people.
12581 : Lord Diabolos... I wonder if he called Prishe into his dreamworld because he knew the truth of her identity--that she is the Keeper of the Apocalypse.
12582 : Was Cardinal Mildaurion also aware of this truth? Is that why she gave Prishe that amulet? But I still...
12583 : %, it may be too late at this point, but there is something I must tell you.
12584 : When Prishe had collapsed, and her amulet was stolen...
12585 : It was only for a second, but I'm pretty damn sure.
12586 : The presence I felt when the amulet was stolen... It was definitely Miss Mildaurion!
12587 : You're saying that Cardinal Mildaurion took the amulet from you?
12588 : Why would she act in such a manner? Did not the cardinal give the amulet to you as a gift?
12589 : Yeah, she did. Miss Mildaurion was always watching over me through the amulet.
12590 : She was always making sure I wasn't thinking of doing something stupid or getting myself into trouble.
12591 : But she needed to take the amulet back.
12592 : An old, old friend she'd waited a long, long time for had finally returned...
12593 : She apologized to me in her thoughts. Said that I would be safe while I was in Jeuno...
12594 : But then...
12595 : Cardinal Mildaurion would have known that we, the survivors of the Great War, were unable to leave the island...
12596 : She knew, but she did not come to help us. She abandoned us to our fate...?
12597 : No, I don't think so. Miss Mildaurion left it to me.
12598 : Left what to you...?
12599 : What was Prishe about to say, I wonder.
12600 : What could Cardinal Mildaurion have entrusted to us? Surely not the resurrection of the Twilight God...?
12601 : It might be naive of me to believe that you are on my side.
12602 : However, I am not willing to give up.
12603 : I want to sing of a world where both Vana'diel and all of her people are saved.
12604 : Will you dream of such a world alongside me?
12605 : Do you dare to dream? Yes, I'll fight to the end! Reality is not that kind...
12606 : Thank you, %!
12607 : I am sorry. I have asked too much without considering your feelings.
12608 : I will once again go to the Grand Duke Palace. I've not found anyone in town who has information, but Makki-Chebukki and the others have probably tracked down some rumors.
12609 : There must be something we can do to save Prishe... There must be someone who knows of the cardinal...
12610 : %! What are you doing here!?
12611 : Have you found some means to stop the Wyrmking, Bahamut?
12612 : The battle will soon begin. An airship carrying a group of adventurers was downed in an attack by the wyrms.
12613 : We have completed preparations on the warships, and nothing remains to be done.
12614 : Only... I don't know if this is good news or bad news to you, but the commander of the Jeunoan Armada, Lady Esha'ntarl, is nowhere to be found!
12615 : Lord Nag'molada has also disappeared without so much as an escort... Dammit! This wouldn't be your doing, would it!?
12616 : Is this your doing? All part of my plan. Of course not!
12617 : Please, %, this is no time for sarcasm. Forgive my wild accusations.
12618 : My apologies. You must forgive my wild accusations.
12619 : No matter how much one despises senseless bloodshed, there are few who can stand by while their home is burned to the ground.
12620 : And so, if it means saving Jeuno from the wyrms, I have no choice but to cooperate with this race of ancients.
12621 : Captain Wolfgang! The criminals who escaped with warship zero-three have been identified!
12622 : It appears to be the work of those three Tarutaru! We have a witness who overheard them talking about heading to a place they referred to as the fated land.
12623 : They took a warship!? Is it possible they know where our missing officials have disappeared to!?
12624 : And where is this fated land they spoke of!? Split up and find some answers!
12625 : Where could this fated land be? I wouldn't even know where to start looking.
12626 : But now that I think of it, I could have sworn I heard that name somewhere before... Where was it...?
12627 : You adventurers are quick to hear the news! Lady Esha'ntarl has returned to us!
12628 : The Jeunoan Armada has been authorized to begin an assault on the wyrms!
12629 : We are conducting final flight inspections on all vessels. Please keep out of the way and allow the engineers to do their job.
12630 : Waaah! <sniff>
12631 : Waaah! <snuffle>
12632 : Waaah! <gurgle>
12633 : What a racket. Those Tarutaru were punished for their crimes of stealing a warship and flying out of Jeuno.
12634 : They claim they were just following orders, but Lord Nag'molada is also awaiting disciplinary action to be decided by the [Armathrwn Society/archduke].
12635 : No matter your position, if you break the law...
12636 : Hm? Isn't that lady a friend of yours?
12637 : Oh, you three!
12638 : Whatever is the matter?
12639 : Come now, no more tears. Surely things are not that bad?
12640 : We're done for.
12641 : Our necks are on the chopping block.
12642 : We've gotta get out of here!
12643 : Whatever for? There are rumors all over town about the brave Tarutaru who saved an important official.
12644 : Is there some other terrible failure that you are regretting?
12645 : No, we've done everything right. We used the right blend of deceit and betrayal, honey and vinegar...
12646 : We bribed the townsfolk, and avoided the authorities...
12647 : We've groomed ourselves into the perfect candidates to become bureaucrats of the future...
12648 : They have to run off because I showed up.
12649 : Prishe!?
12650 : What the hell is wrong with you!? If you keep this up, I'm gonna start rethinking my plan to put you in charge of Tavnazia.
12651 : Get yourselves together, or I'm gonna kick you into next Watersday! You have a responsibility to look out for Ulmia and everyone else in the Marquisate!
12652 : Wh-what?
12653 : Sorry to fly off without an explanation, Ulmia.
12654 : And you, %. Thanks for worrying about me.
12655 : There's not much time, but I'll tell you what I know. Get yourselves to the audience chamber.
12656 : Prishe...?
12657 : Ah, that energetic young Elvaan girl just entered the audience chamber. Hmmm... I thought she had been taken into custody...
12658 : With all the preparations for the launch of the armada, there are currently few people remaining in the Grand Palace. I wonder who gave the girl permission to enter...
12659 : Hello, Ulmia. You've been through quite an ordeal.
12660 : C-Cardinal Mildaurion...!?
12661 : What is going on...?
12662 : I am sorry, Ulmia. We don't have time for lengthy explanations.
12663 : However, there is one thing that I must tell you.
12664 : My true name is Esha'ntarl.
12665 : Ten thousand years ago I was born in Al'Taieu, the city that enfolds the fifth mothercrystal.
12666 : Nag'molada, and the other members of the Armathrwn Society that now govern Jeuno, are also of an ancient race of people--a race recently awoken from a centuries-long sleep.
12667 : But I am different from the others. Through an unusual twist of fate, I was granted immortality.
12668 : !?
12669 : I pledged to use this unending life to bring to fruition the pact made between Selh'teus and the terrestrial avatars.
12670 : After the passing of ten thousand years, a child of destiny would be born in the fated land. The Keeper of the Apocalypse...the one I have sworn to destroy.
12671 : I have spent many years preparing for the coming of the keeper.
12672 : It has been an incredibly long journey.
12673 : I have traveled to the far reaches of Vana'diel in search of lost secrets...
12674 : I have found solace and encouragement in the many encounters I have had along the way...
12675 : But then, when I came to a certain place, I was warned:
12676 : Destroying the Keeper of the Apocalypse will merely set the darkness free to reincarnate in another body.
12677 : To break this cycle, the darkness itself must be obliterated.
12678 : It must be erased from the place where all life originates and where all life eventually returns--the mothercrystal.
12679 : To fully eradicate the darkness, the Keeper of the Apocalypse must be destroyed not in the form of a human, but in the form of a god.
12680 : That is why I conceived a plan to use the Lay of the Immortals to resurrect Promathia.
12681 : Resurrection...and destruction...?
12682 : But that plan eventually failed.
12683 : At the baptismal ceremony, I...
12684 : At that time, I was having my strings pulled by the Emptiness inside me.
12685 : I lived in the Tavnazian Cathedral since the time of my earliest memories, and believed that the Gates of Paradise must be opened.
12686 : But as my bad luck would have it, the Emptiness inside me reacted to the baptismal vessel and was sealed within this magicite.
12687 : My world was tipped upside down. I was suddenly able to read people's thoughts and, just like Cardinal Mildaurion, I never aged another day.
12688 : So that is what happened. You were the Keeper of the Apocalypse...
12689 : But things are different now. You are no longer the one, are you?
12690 : ...
12691 : Are you saying that nothing has changed? What is to happen to Prishe?
12692 : Judging by the actions of Bahamut, the keeper is still among us.
12693 : But over the last twenty years I have watched over the lands of Vana'diel, I have seen no other possible incarnations...
12694 : Bahamut wishes to see me smashed to bits in the form of the Twilight God.
12695 : It was Diabolos that let me in on my destiny as the Keeper of the Apocalypse.
12696 : It is my fate to be destroyed along with this magicite, and set adrift from the cycle of the mothercrystal.
12697 : No! This is too horrible!
12698 : Listen to me, Ulmia. We've come pretty far in this quest. I've already heard four of the verses needed to resurrect the Twilight God.
12699 : Once we have the last verse, we can finally stand before Bahamut...!
12700 : Please, Prishe! Do you hear what you are saying!?
12701 : How can I let you offer your very existence to Promathia? There must be another way...!
12702 : Calm yourself, Ulmia. Prishe will not be coming with us.
12703 : The last verse of the Memoria de la S^tona no longer exists, and there is no weapon left to battle the Twilight God.
12704 : Pitting the full force of Jeuno against the wyrms is our only recourse.
12705 : There is no other way to save the children of Altana from extinction.
12706 : But Miss Mildaurion! What about me?
12707 : Lady Esha'ntarl! The Jeunoan Armada is prepared for battle!
12708 : I must go. Beyond the sea of endless clouds.
12709 : Cardinal Mildaurion!
12710 : Prishe. Ulmia. It is only a matter of time until Jeuno becomes a war zone.
12711 : I will prepare an airship for your return to Tavnazia.
12712 : Protect that which is most dear to you.
12713 : Dammit! There's no way in hell it's ending this way! It's time to put it all on the line!
12714 : Prishe!?
12715 : %! Ulmia!
12716 : I know you guys can do it!
12717 : You're strong enough now to beat the hell out of me when I become Promathia...
12718 : Listen, there is someone in Selbina who knows the fifth verse. Her memory is a little shoddy, though...
12719 : Find the fifth verse!
12720 : I need you to do this! You hear me!?
12721 : I cannot...! Prishe, wait!
12722 : Ulmia, I have heard the entire story.
12723 : Louverance!?
12724 : This must be the guidance of Altana. The girl with a shoddy memory in Selbina is well known to me.
12725 : And I also happen to possess the means to revive her past. Let us be on our way.
12726 : What? Is there a girl in Selbina with a serious case of amnesia?
12727 : How would I know? I'm always confined to my post here in Jeuno. You're the adventurer. Why don't you know these things?
12728 : Those three Tarutaru brought to Jeuno by Nag'molada have been granted amnesty by Lady Esha'ntarl.
12729 : However, I don't believe they have much of a future here in the Duchy.
12730 : Once you have angered [the Armathrwn Society/the archduke], it would take no less than a miracle to regain [their/his] trust.
12731 : %! It appears you caught up with the armada.
12732 : I heard the report. The attack against Bahamut failed, but we have dealt him a critical blow.
12733 : Lady Esha'ntarl is to join the main fleet and lead our forces in a mass assault.
12734 : She mentioned that she would like to meet with you all before the attack commences. You are to meet her for a confidential briefing in the tavern in Upper Jeuno.
12735 : Do not keep Lady Esha'ntarl waiting. May victory in battle be yours.
12736 : Captain Wolfgang has asked me to remind you that you are to hurry to the Marble Bridge in Upper Jeuno.
12737 : It sounded as if it was urgent. You had best be on your way!
12738 : Recently, there have been no signs of Nag'molada or those annoying Tarutaru entering the Grand Duke Palace.
12739 : I heard from one of the guards that the Tarutaru were seen riding an airship to Bastok, but as for Nag'molada...
12740 : The palace is often the site for grand banquets that are attended by dignitaries from every nation. In times like these, we do our utmost to see that the needs of our important visitors are met.
12741 : Recently, [Lord Nag'molada/Lady Esha'ntarl] has been requesting the oddest things from the palace staff.
12742 : These requests appear to be for objects desired by guests of the Duchy.
12743 : These requests appear to be for objects desired by guests of our eminent official.
12744 : If the requested items could be found in Jeuno, nay, in the markets of any country, we would endeavor to procure them.
12745 : However, many of these objects are not available for purchase. I am in quite a quandary, as you can see.
12746 : Perhaps if I were to offer a reward, you would be so kind as to locate these items on my behalf?
12747 : Would you be so kind? Certainly. I am afraid not.
12748 : The following items have been requested: %, %, and %. My future employment rests in your hands.
12749 : The following items have been requested: %, %, %, and %. My future employment rests in your hands.
12750 : The following items have been requested: %, %, %, %, and %. My future employment rests in your hands.
12751 : Lord Nag'molada often receives guests of all kinds, but I have never before been besieged with such bizarre requests.
12752 : This is the first time Lady Esha'ntarl has ever made such a request of the palace staff. Furthermore, I do believe this is the first time she has personally received guests...
12753 : While I am curious to know what kind of guests we are entertaining, a good servant does not intrude on the business of his employer.
12754 : Ah, splendid. It appears you have been successful. You have my most heartfelt gratitude.
12755 : Why would the guests of [Lord Nag'molada/Lady Esha'ntarl] be so enchanted with these barbaric objects?
12756 : Oh dear, but I must watch my manners. Please forgive my indiscretion. Here is your reward.
12757 : These items were available at the air travel agency? Well, one learns something new every day. Your reward, as promised.
12758 : To see an array of such objects rekindles my desire to visit the Far East. How aromas of the unknown inspire our imagination! Here is your reward.
12759 : I am sure any child's eyes would light up at a collection of toys such as this.
12760 : I must admit to being quite interested in these myself. One never forgets the joy of one's youth. Your reward, [sir/madame].
12761 : Perhaps this is a gift for the lady of the house? These items are not of the highest quality...
12762 : But I must not presume to judge the guests of [Lord Nag'molada/Lady Esha'ntarl]. Please accept your reward.
12763 : Your assistance is greatly appreciated. I am certain [Lord Nag'molada/Lady Esha'ntarl]'s guests will be most satisfied with your efforts.
12764 : ...Emptiness...... ......Possible weaknesses... Hmmm......
12765 : Greetings, adventurer. I am Harith, alchemist and member of a certain prestigious society here in Jeuno.
12766 : Perchance you have heard of creatures known as the Empty? Currently, other alchemists in the society are working feverishly on methods to manipulate these mysterious beasts.
12767 : Would you like me to continue?
12768 : Well...? Please, go on. I'm busy at the moment.
12769 : I apologize for taking up your valuable time. May fortune smile upon you in your journey.
12770 : The Empty are a cold and hollow species--their very existence a void of nothingness. They possess no feeling, no will, no purpose... It is this lack of characteristics that makes them powerful, as they have no known weaknesses.
12771 : However, deep within their dark shells we have discovered that something does exist--that something being a fragment of a memory lost in the pages of time.
12772 : If you happen to have the fortune of coming across one of these incomplete memories on your journeys, bring it to me and I shall purify it into a form known as anima using the methods discovered by the society.
12773 : By studying the various types of memories left by the Empty, we may be able to discover their strengths and weaknesses.
12774 : If you happen to have the fortune of coming across one of these incomplete memories on your journeys, bring it to me and I shall purify it into a form known as anima using the methods discovered by the society.
12775 : In addition to these memory fragments, we are also collecting %, %, and % to help us better understand how these creatures evolved. Worry not, as you will be duly rewarded for any and all contributions.
12776 : Yes... This is definitely the memory of one of the Empty--and in quite excellent condition, I must say.
12777 : I can synthesize it into a concentrated form of anima; however, I will require a small fee of # gil.
12778 : You hand Harith the % and # gil.
12779 : What a remarkable specimen! This % may be the key to unlocking the secrets of the Empty!
12780 : Here, please accept this as a token of my gratitude.
12781 : I will begin the synthesis right away. Please wait a few moments.
12782 : Ah, what a heavenly glow!
12783 : By throwing this anima back at the Empty, they will temporarily regain a splinter of consciousness. It is during this time that you may be able to find their weaknesses.
12784 : Greetings, adventurer! My name is Tillecoe, pupil of the great and powerful mage Abdhaljs, and I have been assigned with the management of my master's greatest creation--Diorama Abdhaljs-Ghelsba.

12929 : Out of my... Wait just a moment. Let me have a good look at you...
12930 : Yes... You may be of some use to me after all.
12931 : My name is Venessa. I have traveled from my homeland far to the west to hone my skills under the supervision of the ducal alchemists.
12932 : I am currently studying the phenomenon known as the Emptiness and how its byproducts can be better utilized in my field.
12933 : My recent research has shown that in addition to the variety of creatures that roam the plains of Promyvion, there are a handful of even stronger manifests that dwell deep within towers that loom above the vast expanses of darkness.
12934 : To continue my work, I require fresh remnants of these rare beasts. Of course, your efforts will not go unrewarded.
12935 : Will you accept my offer? Of course. Not today. Tell me more. You've lost me.
12936 : Then you are wasting my time.
12937 : I have told you enough!
12938 : Then you are of no use to me. Begone!
12939 : Excellent.
12940 : According to data collected by the Duchy, there are several different locations around Vana'diel where the Empty thrive. Adventurers have given these realms the name Promyvion.
12941 : If my hypothesis is correct, I believe there are four types of special remnants--one to coincide with each area. Which area do you wish to investigate?
12942 : Travel to... Nowhere at this time. The Spire of Holla. The Spire of Dem. The Spire of Mea. The Spire of Vahzl.
12943 : If you have no intentions of assisting me, then stop wasting my time!
12944 : [Holla/Dem/Mea/Vahzl], you say? Then you will need this %.
12945 : Wait just a moment... I remember you.
12946 : While I appreciate your assistance, I do not have any more censers to aid you on your travels into Promyvion. I must ask you to return at a later date.
12947 : Yes, I may be able to provide you with another % on  ( Earth time) and not a day sooner.
12948 : Here, you may have this one, but take care not to lose it. These artifacts are extremely difficult to come by, and I have only a limited supply.
12949 : And if you happen to come across one of the rare remnants that I seek, bring it directly to me. Only then will you receive your reward.
12950 : What is this? You say you found something that may be of interest?
12951 : Yes... Yes! With this I can prove my ability to the society! I am guaranteed a position within their ranks for sure!
12952 : Hm? Your reward? Oh, I do remember promising you something if you succeeded at your mission. How about this %? I don't think the society will be missing it.
12953 : Out of my... Wait just a moment. You wouldn't happen to have returned because you wish to delve into the depths of Promyvion once more, would you?
12954 : Well? That's why I'm here. I was just passing by.
12955 : I have neither the time nor patience to be bothered by every ignorant cretin that happens to wander by. Begone!
12956 : %! Lady Esha'ntarl's ship has returned.
12957 : This is excellent timing. I was ordered to find you and ask that you proceed to the Marble Bridge--the tavern in Upper Jeuno.
12958 : My duty here is done. I must now journey to each nation and report that the Wyrmking Bahamut no longer poses a threat.
12959 : I hear that this development is all thanks to you and your companions. You have the gratitude of all Jeunoans.
12960 : I have awaited your return, %. You must tell me all that has happened.
12961 : After clashing with our army several times, the dragons suddenly broke off their attack and disappeared into the distant clouds.
12962 : There were voices raised in support of hunting the wyrms into extinction, but for the moment we have returned to resupply and reconsider our position.
12963 : Now that you are here, I can finally be certain.
12964 : Am I to assume from your jubilant features that the Keeper of the Apocalypse has been defeated?
12965 : Has the keeper been defeated? Completely. Who can say?
12966 : I knew it! Bahamut sensed the keeper's downfall and pulled his forces out of battle...
12967 : Tell me. What momentous events transpired in the Celestial Capital?
12968 : On Cape Riverne, the images that flowed into me from Selh'teus...
12969 : They were of the incomplete Paradise, Al'Taieu...
12970 : The people of Al'Taieu returned to their deity ten thousand years ago. Returned to Promathia...
12971 : Opening the Gates of Paradise is a metaphor for restoring the shattered mothercrystal. A way to return the world to its original state.
12972 : The world becomes a paradise, and its people ascend to godhood. The Dawnmaiden Yve'noile has memories of witnessing the true form of the great goddess Altana.
12973 : Yve'noile spoke to me before we parted ways.
12974 : She said, As I gazed upon her perfection, I realized I could not be a part of her. I wondered who I could possibly be.
12975 : That was when she began her research into the race of people.
12976 : After shifting her focus to the inexplicable appearance of the Kuluu phenomenon, Yve'noile became aware of the darkness that resided within us all.
12977 : Her realization led her to betray the king and his son, and adamantly oppose any plan to open the Gates of Paradise.
12978 : She had discovered our origins as the children of Promathia...
12979 : But all has not been resolved.
12980 : The Emptiness still seethes within the mothercrystals.
12981 : And the surviving Zilart yet cling desperately to their shadowy plan of returning to Paradise.
12982 : I gave up my life in Tavnazia almost thirty years ago to infiltrate the organization of the newly awakened Zilart.
12983 : But I have been unable to stem their vast power on my own.
12984 : However, we now have a common enemy in the Emptiness. For a time, the people of this age will require the aid of the ancients.
12985 : The ancients, too, will need your continuing help.
12986 : Surely the Dawn Maiden has bequeathed something of value to her younger kin.
12987 : I will find out what this may be, and speak with Archduke Kam'lanaut. He will heed my words.
12988 : I shall continue to watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.
12989 : Now that Nag'molada is gone and the wyrms have ceased their attacks, it is time to remind the Zilart of their true responsibility:
12990 : The safety of the mothercrystals and the battle against the Emptiness.
12991 : I will continue to monitor their actions as I watch over the world that you and your companions have fought so valiantly to protect.
12992 : There is one thing I'd like you to keep in mind, %.
12993 : You were able to save the world and her people without sacrificing one or the other.
12994 : But do not misunderstand.
12995 : This possibility did not always exist.
12996 : It was only with the strength and faith of many people that such a path could open before you.
12997 : I have left with the owner of this tavern three rewards that may help you on your adventures. Feel free to choose one.
12998 : Until our paths cross once more, %.
12999 : Thank you, and farewell.

13044 : What is it?
13045 : What do you say? Never mind. Let's chat. Tell me your level and combat style. Let's talk about combat signals. Let's talk about jobs. Let's talk about appearances. I need %.
13046 : I'll be going, then.
13047 : Okay, then. See ya!
13048 : Then I'll be leaving. See you around.
13049 : Very well. Until next we meet.
13050 : Then I'll see you later!
13051 : Sure. Don't hestitate to call me again.
13052 : Okay. Take care, then.
13053 : See you later, then.
13054 : Then I bid you farewell.
13055 : Oh? Bye, then!
13056 : Very well. Until next we meet.
13057 : Is that all? Then I'm leaving.
13058 : What do you talk about? Signals for low health. Signals for low magic. Signals for weapon skill usage. Other combat concerns.
13059 : Do you need to know? Yes, that would help. Not really.
13060 : Which do you recommend? Shield style. Attacker style. Healer style. Stalwart shield style. Fierce attacker style. Soothing healer style.
13061 : Time for a change? You betcha. It's fine how it is.
13062 : I was wondering if you'd seen that child we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis. Is she keeping out of trouble?
13063 : Is the little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis doing okay? Just wondering...
13064 : You remember that little girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? I was just worried...ah, never mind.
13065 : Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? There's something that's been bothering me...
13066 : The girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis... Have you seen her since then? I'm just a little worried, that's all.
13067 : By the way, do you remember the young lady we saved in Eldieme Necropolis? Such a fragile little thing... I hope she's okay.
13068 : I wonder how the little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis is doing. I was just thinking about it.
13069 : So, have you seen the little girl we found crying in the Eldieme Necropolis lately? Just wondering how she was doing.
13070 : How is the young girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis doing? Hope she's staying out of trouble...
13071 : You remember that adorable little girl we found in the Eldieme Necropolis, don't you? I wonder if she's doing okay.
13072 : Have you seen that young lady we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis lately? There's something that's been bothering me...
13073 : Do you remember the young girl we saved in the Eldieme Necropolis? If you see her, tell her she shouldn't be wandering outside town alone.
13074 : I was thinking about that dragon we fought in Ghelsba. What was it even doing there? Does it have something to do with that mirror?
13075 : Do you remember the battle we fought with that dragon in Ghelsba? What on Vana'diel was a dragon doing there, anyway!?
13076 : About that dragon we fought in Ghelsba... Do you think the mirror was feeding it power?
13077 : There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba. Why was it there, I wonder...
13078 : Do you remember that terrible dragon we fought together in Ghelsba? It felt as though the power of the mirror had driven it into that frenzied state.
13079 : The encounter we had with the dragon in Ghelsba sure was a close call. I'm sure glad I showed up when I did.
13080 : Why was that dragon in Ghelsba? I hope it doesn't foreshadow something worse...
13081 : I wonder why that dragon we fought was in Ghelsba. Was it after the mirror, maybe?
13082 : Do you remember the dragon we fought in Ghelsba? It's strange that such a creature would be found there...
13083 : Are there usually dragons in Ghelsba? I mean, besides the one we fought...
13084 : There should not have been a dragon in Ghelsba. Why was it there, I wonder...
13085 : The dragon we fought in Ghelsba does not belong there. I suspect a sinister hand behind its presence.

13147 : Fair enough.
13148 : Got it!
13149 : No problem.
13150 : Understood.
13151 : Got it!

13155 : Okay, then.
13156 : Okay, got it!
13157 : Understood.
13158 : Fine.
13159 : I haven't really thought much about jobs. What kind of combat style would be good, do you think?
13160 : Jobs? I'll try anything once. What style of combat do you recommend?
13161 : I'm not that interested in jobs. Give me a style of combat and I'll stick to that.
13162 : There are so many jobs to choose from. Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?
13163 : What combat style could I use that would be helpful to you?
13164 : Feel free to go ahead and choose my combat style. I don't mind.
13165 : I can fight in any style, no matter what my job is. Do you have any particular style you want me to use?
13166 : No matter the job, I can fight in any style! Is there a particular style you recommend?
13167 : Jobs? If the style of fighting is the same, the job doesn't matter much to me. What kind of combat style do you recommend?
13168 : I don't know much about jobs, but can you recommend a combat style for me?
13169 : There are so many jobs to choose from. Why don't you recommend a style of combat instead?
13170 : You presume to have knowledge on how I should approach combat?
13171 : Hmm. I'll give it a shot.
13172 : Right! That's the style for me!
13173 : Hmm. I'll try it.
13174 : Okay. I'll try that next time I fight.
13175 : Okay then. I'll start doing that from next time.
13176 : Sounds good! Leave it to me!
13177 : Okay, I'll look forward to trying it.
13178 : Okay! Sounds like fun!
13179 : Really? Okay, I'll try it out.
13180 : Hmmm. Okay! I'll do my best!
13181 : Okay. I'll try that next time I fight.
13182 : Fine. I will try your suggested combat style.
13183 : What? You think I should change my headwear?
13184 : My headwear? You think it's time for a change?
13185 : You don't like my headwear?
13186 : Are you suggesting a change in headwear?
13187 : You want to choose new headwear for me?
13188 : You're interested in my headwear? Sure, I don't mind you coordinating my fashion.
13189 : What? Come on, out with it. You think I should change my headwear?
13190 : Huh!? You don't like my headwear? Should I wear something else?
13191 : Yes? You want me to change my headwear?
13192 : What are you staring at? Don't you like my headwear?
13193 : Are you suggesting a change in headwear?
13194 : My headwear collection accounts for all possible battle conditions. Pick one that will meet your needs.
13195 : Well, I guess I could wear something else.
13196 : Hmm, I suppose a change couldn't hurt.
13197 : I'll change it, then.
13198 : Very well. I'll find something new.
13199 : Thanks. I'll try this one.
13200 : Ooh, I like your style!
13201 : Okay, I'll change it for you.
13202 : Well, okay. A change is as good as a holiday!
13203 : I'll try something new, then.
13204 : Hmm. I'll see what I can come up with!
13205 : Very well. I'll find something new.
13206 : Well, well, it seems you have an eye for these things. I shall equip this from now on.
13207 : I'll forget you said anything, then.
13208 : Oh? Okay.
13209 : Well, that's a relief.
13210 : I'll stay the way I am, then.
13211 : So I don't need to change it? Fashion can be so frustrating...
13212 : You like me just the way I am, eh?
13213 : Well, that's good to hear.
13214 : Are you sure? Well, I guess that's a good thing...
13215 : Oh? Alright, then.
13216 : Phew! I thought you thought I looked funny or something!
13217 : I'll stay the way I am, then.
13218 : I own only the best gear, so I don't blame you for being indecisive.
13219 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13220 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13221 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13222 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13223 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13224 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13225 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13226 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13227 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13228 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13229 : You lost it? Here, take this.
13230 : You lost it? Hmph. Here, take this. But there'll be hell to pay if you misplace that one, too.
13231 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13232 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13233 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13234 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13235 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13236 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13237 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13238 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13239 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13240 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13241 : I just gave you one! I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait.
13242 : I just gave you one! You are really trying my patience. Ask me again when I'm not so annoyed.
13243 : With all its technology, the Duchy of Jeuno really is an advanced nation. I wonder how tall the cranes in Upper Jeuno are.
13244 : Have you ever lit the lamps of Jeuno? I once helped illuminate the city all the way from the port to Ru'Lude Gardens!
13245 : Did you know that there are two auction houses in Upper Jeuno? Remembering which one is less crowded is nice when you feel like avoiding the crush of people.
13246 : You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens. The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!
13247 : Wouldn't heavy rain flood out lower parts of Jeuno? An architectural defect like that shouldn't be left unchecked...
13248 : Is that old man over there planning to sit down on that bench or what? And they complain about the younger generation being inconsiderate...
13249 : Jeuno is definitely the place for clothes shopping. You can't beat Bastok for jewelry, though.
13250 : Every time I come here I can't help but think that at least one person must've fallen off the edge...
13251 : Jeuno would be the perfect place with a nice restaurant. Maybe I should go into the culinary business.
13252 : I wonder what kind of meals the archduke eats? Do archdukes eat curry...?
13253 : You can find the most amazing things for sale in Ru'Lude Gardens. The Mithran flower shop girl definitely keeps her stock fresh!
13254 : My adventurer's instinct tells me that a secret weapon sleeps here in Jeuno. Most likely the part that would form the main body...
13255 : Apparently, the construction of the cathedral took 120 years to complete. A structure like the Chateau d'Oraguille must take centuries.
13256 : Chateau d'Oraguille is so huge, I had to start running around to see everything! Luckily a nice guard came and gave me a tour of the Bostaunieux Oubliette.
13257 : If you stand by the fountain, some suspicious character will try to engage you in a game of dice. I think he has some kind of gambling problem...
13258 : Were you aware that the moat in moat carp refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?
13259 : Children in this nation sure have it rough, having to work late into the night and all. At least military service isn't compulsory for them anymore.
13260 : A while ago I was tasked with finding a bride for Prince Trion...but it didn't work out. I mean, where in Vana'diel am I supposed to find a slender Tarutaru beauty?
13261 : The furniture stores in San d'Oria have the best selection of goods. No surprise with the Carpenters' Guild so close by.
13262 : How embarrassing... I stumbled into the lumber stacked outside the Carpenters' Guild and knocked every single one down!
13263 : Bean dishes are wholesome, healthy dishes. Blue peas are especially good when you're running low on gil.
13264 : Port San d'Oria is built on a lake, right? What would happen if the waters rose too high...?
13265 : Were you aware that the moat in moat carp refers to the waters surrounding Chateau d'Oraguille?
13266 : That cathedral... It could easily transform into the head, and-- A-ahem! Never mind...
13267 : Does the water wheel on top of the Metalworks move the water, or does the water spin the wheel...?
13268 : Don't you ever get tired of waiting for the elevator and just feel like jumping down instead? No...?
13269 : I just saw a child walking by with an armful of subligaria. Bastok is a weird place...
13270 : I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother. He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...
13271 : How could anyone eat fish caught in Bastok's rivers? I wish there was a way to tell where fish up for auction are taken from.
13272 : I never imagined getting my fashion sense criticized would be such a shattering blow to my self-confidence! Who was that girl anyway...
13273 : I never get tired of browsing the jewelry and cosmetic stores in Bastok.
13274 : I hope I'm as energetic as that chipper old guy in Bastok Markets when I get to his age...
13275 : I've never eaten a treant bulb before. What do they taste like?
13276 : Whose job is it to raise the bridge in Port Bastok? What if they fall asleep? Will the airship crash into the bridge?
13277 : I accepted a request in Bastok Markets to protect someone's younger brother. He didn't seem too pleased to have a babysitter, though...
13278 : The Metalworks is a truly magnificent structure, suitable of serving as the mighty arms that strike down the enemy...
13279 : In Port Windurst, people have opened stores on top of boats in the harbor. I wonder if they ever change locations...
13280 : I was walking around town when a huge nut fell out of a tree and bounced off my head. You should be careful!
13281 : Windurst truly is a magical nation. I was just teleported from Windurst Woods to Windurst Waters in the blink of an eye.
13282 : Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars. The property prices must be astronomical.
13283 : Windurst is virtually governed by the Star Sibyl alone, right? Don't the ordinary citizens mind being sidelined from politics?
13284 : Tarutaru residences are built to accommodate even the tallest Elvaans. But why build shelves so high up...?
13285 : Windurst is famous for its hat shop. I can never visit the city without popping in at least once to check the latest styles.
13286 : The hat shop in Windurst Waters has hoods with little ears attached on display. Are they not for sale?
13287 : The restaurant food in Windurst is prepared by the Culinarians' Guild. I never miss a chance to indulge in one of their superb dishes.
13288 : There seems to be a lot of water in Windurst. What happens if there's a rainstorm and everything floods? It wouldn't take much to submerge a wee Tarutaru...
13289 : Windurst Walls is famous for Heavens Tower and the manors of several prominent scholars. The property prices must be astronomical.
13290 : A large building seems to have been embedded inside the Great Star Tree. I wouldn't be surprised if the leg portion of the secret weapon is concealed within.
13291 : When I travel to hot areas, my feet always sweat inside my boots. Then the sand gets in there and it drives me crazy...
13292 : I'm ashamed to admit it but...I'm hopeless at riding chocobos. I have my license, though. Really.
13293 : Hmm. I can't think of anything to talk about.
13294 : It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.
13295 : Because the weather in town is usually either clear or cloudy, there's no need to carry a change of equipment. But since it can be quite unpredictable out in the wilderness, it's good to be prepared.
13296 : Just between you and me, I obtained my armor here through unconventional methods.
13297 : The other day I had to dash to an outpost to avoid being drenched in a sudden downpour.
13298 : Do you ever get the urge to just run around like a mad thing when the ground is covered with snow?
13299 : I do so much prefer to speak with you face to face. The pearl can be a little impersonal at times.
13300 : Are moogles considered to be beastmen? Is there a moogle king? A god of the moogles?
13301 : It seems there is an ever-growing number of adventurers that have lost interest in the conquest.
13302 : The other week I went to the Tenshodo to collect a pair of gloves I had ordered, only to discover they were closed for business that day.
13303 : I have to change my shoes as soon as I get home or I can't relax. Does anything like that ever happen to you?
13304 : And have you ever worried that the chocobo smell stays with you, even after you dismount? Maybe I'm being paranoid...
13305 : ... Nope, the only thing that comes to mind is the weather. Not very interesting at all.
13306 : Do you notice the change? I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.
13307 : There's nothing I hate more than getting caught outside without the right gear for the weather.
13308 : The range of goods is pretty good if you buy through this method. Unfortunately though, some items aren't always in stock, so you don't always get what you want.
13309 : The guards wouldn't let me inside, if you can believe it! My best dress, ruined!
13310 : But if you run around too much, your shoes get all soggy. And nobody likes soggy shoes now, do they?
13311 : I like to be able to see what you're thinking.
13312 : I wonder what kind of pet a moogle god would keep...
13313 : Do you notice the change? I seem to be very sensitive to these variations.
13314 : Of course, that didn't deter me in the least. I simply seized some of the staff and persuaded them to open shop.
13315 : No one ever seems to want to swing a huge sword while wearing a tunic or a robe...
13316 : I'm hopeless at keeping my room tidy, so I bought some furniture to store all my items.
13317 : I went to the Blacksmiths' Guild the other day to have some armor repaired, but it turned out to be their day off.
13318 : Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?
13319 : I've got my eye on some new equipment, but they're way too expensive.
13320 : I appreciate your concern for my equipment and all, but what about your own attire?
13321 : Have you ever seen an aurora? It looks like a rainbow-colored curtain draped across the sky.
13322 : I never know what to wear on windy days. I mean, you can't wear a skirt, right?
13323 : I've noticed that beastmen seem to carry gil around. What on Vana'diel do they use it for?
13324 : The smilebringers really exist, you know! They live somewhere far to the north!
13325 : Can you tell what kind of equipment I'm wearing?
13326 : In the Near East, a race of rat-like beastmen called Qiqirn live alongside common folk. Their information network is said to be impressive.
13327 : I always thought it would look mysterious and unique. Maybe I just have no fashion sense...
13328 : For some reason, my Mog House began to feel damp after that. Guess I bought too many vases...
13329 : Why does that always happen on the very day you decide to go? Call me impatient, but I ended up just buying a new set of armor...
13330 : You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.
13331 : But if I wait a little longer, maybe the price will come down. It's pretty normal for items to become cheaper after a while.
13332 : Why, you ask? Is it a crime to want your partner to look cool?
13333 : I've heard they can weave cloth that looks just like it. You must be able to make beautiful clothes out of that material...
13334 : Not that I ever wear skirts, anyway...
13335 : Do they trade with people? I wonder what a beastman would buy...
13336 : They dress in red robes and a red hat, and dance around in white subligaria. You believe me, don't you, %?
13337 : You're probably thinking that you've seen this gear before, but it could be something entirely different despite the similarities in appearance.
13338 : But that reputation doesn't guarantee their information will always be accurate. After all, swindling isn't a race-exclusive occupation.
13339 : You're probably thinking that I have a trunk full of armor. I actually trade my old gear in all the time.
13340 : I've been meaning to tell you, but you shouldn't send me any deliveries.
13341 : There are powerful enemies emerging all around us these days. We should keep up our training to avoid being overwhelmed in battle.
13342 : It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls. No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.
13343 : I've heard stories of people who can fight wyrms on even terms.
13344 : You know, I'd love to visit your Mog House one day.
13345 : You really feel like chatting today, I see.
13346 : Do you eat out much?
13347 : I've been trying different combinations of equipment, but I can't seem to make up my mind.
13348 : What do you keep in your Mog House? Do you have furniture and stuff?
13349 : It's so much easier to converse while we're within the city walls. No need to keep an eye on the surroundings.
13350 : I usually spend my spare time on weapon maintenance and training. How do you spend yours?
13351 : I have a friend in the business, you see. I'll introduce you sometime.
13352 : The delivery people seem to have me mixed up with some other adventurer and I'm not getting my mail...
13353 : Of course, I'll be there to fight beside you. Why don't we train together?
13354 : I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.
13355 : To become strong like that, how many hours a day do you think I should spend leveling?
13356 : M...my Mog House, you ask? Out of the question! It's a total mess, with month-old half-eaten scraps...and much worse!
13357 : Well, you could at least offer up a topic for conversation occasionally!
13358 : Even though we get so much exercise, I start gaining weight if I eat too much good food. Must be a metabolism thing...
13359 : I have as many as four different sets worked out... I suppose using them in combat will help me to decide.
13360 : It's probably filled with flowerpots, right? Or maybe you have one of those mannequins!
13361 : I suppose we could always talk in a restaurant or a Mog House, but I've become quite attached to our informal meeting spot.
13362 : What? You...journey with other adventurers...? N...not that it's any of my business, of course...
13363 : What do you say? Never mind. Let's chat. Let's talk about quests. Let's talk about battle. Let's talk about appearances. I need %.
13364 : What do you ask about? Quests we've taken together. Quests you're on now.
13365 : What do you ask about? I've changed my mind. Tell me your level and combat style. Combat signals. Combat styles. Weapons skills.
13366 : What do you ask about? I've changed my mind. Headwear. Fashionable equipment.
13367 : What should I wear? Your current headwear is fine. A leather bandana. An iron visor. A trader's chapeau. An iron mask. A mythril sallet. A tiger helm. A war beret. An austere hat. A wyvern helm. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. No headwear at all.

13379 : So, which do you think would suit me?
13380 : Fashionable equipment? Tell me what you think suits me!
13381 : So, what do you think would suit me?
13382 : I wonder what would suit me...
13383 : Is there something that'll suit me?
13384 : Ooh, you wanna coordinate my attire for me?
13385 : I think I look good in most things, but give me your honest opinion on which would suit me best.
13386 : Oh, so much to choose from! You pick for me!
13387 : So, what do you think would suit me?
13388 : Oh! Pick something that doesn't make me look fat!
13389 : I wonder which of these would suit me...
13390 : If you have an opinion, let's hear it.
13391 : What equipment looks best? I'm not really sure. Body. Hands. Legs. Feet. None.
13392 : Any other suggestions? None. Body. Hands. Legs. Feet.
13393 : I think you're right. I'll stick with this for a while.
13394 : I like your taste! I'll wear this for a while.
13395 : Hmm. Well, I guess this isn't too bad...
13396 : Well, then. I'll see that I wear this from now on.
13397 : This one? I think I like it! I'll wear it from now on.
13398 : Heheh, I had a feeling you'd pick this one. I've got a pile of spares, so there's no need to worry!
13399 : Oh? Not a bad choice. I'll wear this for a while, then.
13400 : Oh! That's my wardrobe sorted for a while!
13401 : If that's your choice, I'm happy to go with it for the time being.
13402 : Nice! I'll wear this from now on.
13403 : Well, then. I'll see that I wear this from now on.
13404 : Hm... Looks like your fashion sense is above average. I have no qualms about your selection.
13405 : This...?
13406 : Are you sure...?
13407 : ...
13408 : I see...
13409 : Uh-huh...?
13410 : This thing here...?
13411 : I suppose fashion is not your game...
13412 : This? Um...okay...
13413 : This...?
13414 : Really? Kinda boring, but okay...
13415 : I see...
13416 : Hmph... Remind me not to ask your opinion again.
13417 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
13418 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Do you wanna help me out?
13419 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
13420 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It appears to be a most complicated phenomenon.
13421 : Actually, I've been asked to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Can you help me out?
13422 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It's not exactly exciting, but can I rely on your help?
13423 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. How about helping me out?
13424 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Do you wanna come along?
13425 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. Would you like to help me out?
13426 : Actually, I've been asked to look into this Emptiness thing. Why don't you come along?
13427 : Actually, I've been requested to carry out an investigation of the Emptiness. It appears to be a most complicated phenomenon.
13428 : Actually, I found a new assignment for you, to fill up your abundance of spare time. It's an investigation of the Emptiness.
13429 : I don't want to interrupt your other adventuring activities, so just come along when you're ready.
13430 : Any time is fine. Just show up and I'll be there. Try not to forget about it though, huh?
13431 : Maybe I'll run into you in Promyvion. See you there.
13432 : If I may, I would like to have your assistance in this matter. I have no strict timetable, so please come along when you are ready.
13433 : Any time is fine, so please help me! I...I'll be waiting for you in Promyvion. Please come quickly--that place gives me the creeps!
13434 : I'd appreciate your help whenever you can afford it.  Looking forward to seeing you in Promyvion!
13435 : Whenever you have free time is fine. I'll be waiting for you.
13436 : Anytime is fine. Just show up and I'll be there. Try not to forget about it though, huh?
13437 : You can show up whenever you have time. I'll even prepare a reward for you.
13438 : Come on, it'll be fun! I'll be there whenever you're ready.
13439 : If I may, I would like to have your assistance in this matter. I have no strict timetable, so please come along when you are ready.
13440 : Considering I was the one who accepted the assignment, it's only fair I accompany you. I will be waiting on location, so hurry up with your preparations.
13441 : Thanks for your help the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
13442 : I'm glad you were there the other day! Here, take this and call any time you need me.
13443 : Oh, I have something for you in return for your help the other day. Here.
13444 : Thank you for your assistance the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
13445 : Thank you so much for the other day. This isn't much, but it's just my way of showing my appreciation. Use it to call me anytime!
13446 : I really appreciate your help the other day. Everything worked out really well. If there's anything I can do in return, just use this to call me, okay?
13447 : Your help the other day was most appreciated. Take this, and use it to call me if you're ever in need.
13448 : Thanks a bunch for your help the other day! Use this to call me and I'll return the favor!
13449 : Thanks for your help the other day. Here, take this and call me anytime.
13450 : Thank you so much for your help the other day! Here, take this and call me if you're ever in trouble.
13451 : Thank you for your assistance the other day. Here, take this and don't hesitate to call if you need me.
13452 : You did very well the other day. Here, this is your share of the reward for completing the assignment.
13453 : That % you're holding, is that about combat styles? Can I take a look?
13454 : Hey, is that % you're holding about combat styles? Can I take a look?
13455 : Is that % about combat styles? Let me borrow it for a bit.
13456 : Does that % you hold pertain to combat styles, by any chance? Might I take a look?
13457 : What's that? Hey, isn't that % about combat styles? Can I have a look?
13458 : How did you come by an unusual item like that? Wait a minute. That %...isn't it about combat styles? Mind if I sneak a peek?
13459 : Hm? Is that % you're holding about combat styles? Would you mind if I borrowed it?
13460 : Hey, is that % you're holding about combat styles? Don't be a hog, hand it over!
13461 : Would that % you're holding be about combat styles? Can I see it?
13462 : Hey, is that % about combat styles? Lemme see! Lemme see!
13463 : Does that % you hold pertain to combat styles, by any chance? Might I take a look?
13464 : Hm? How did you come to be in possession of that %? Go on, show it to me.
13465 : Hmm, that made a lot of sense. Let me know if you find any more of these.
13466 : That was pretty informative stuff. If you find any more manuals like that, let me know!
13467 : Hmm. There's a lot more to combat than I thought. Let me know if you find any more manuals like that.
13468 : A fascinating read. Please let me know if you happen to come across any similar works.
13469 : Wow, so much I never knew... If you have any more of these, please show them to me!
13470 : Nope, never seen this one before. Uh-huh... So you're supposed to do this, and then--ah, I got it! Be sure to let me know if you come across any others, okay?
13471 : Well, that cleared up a few things for me. Let me know if you find any similar books.
13472 : Wow! I never knew there was still so much to learn! If you find any more of these, you know where to bring them!
13473 : Hmm...interesting. I'd appreciate it if you brought me any more of these you happened to find.
13474 : Hmm... I think I understood most of it. Let me know if you find any more of these, okay?
13475 : A fascinating read. Please let me know if you happen to come across any similar works.
13476 : This is remarkable content indeed... I never knew such a combat style existed. Should you obtain any other such texts, bring them to me without delay.
13477 : Your adventuring fellow has learned a new combat style!
13478 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. Personally, I think it's better off broken...
13479 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. I bet something incredible will happen when we do...
13480 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. Luto has been blinded by her lust for treasure...
13481 : I wonder if the mirror can truly be repaired. Let us not waste any time gathering the information Luto mentioned.
13482 : So we're going to fix the mirror. I have a bad feeling about this...
13483 : If it's what you want to do, %, I'll help you fix the mirror.
13484 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. And what could this rare metal possibly be?
13485 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. It's kind of exciting!
13486 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. I just hope that nothing terrible happens...
13487 : I can't believe we're actually going to fix that mirror. I'm a little scared, to be perfectly honest...
13488 : I wonder if the mirror can truly be repaired. Let us not waste any time gathering the information Luto mentioned.
13489 : So the fate of that mirror has fallen into our hands... First, we must seek the items Luto spoke of.
13490 : Let's get this full-course meal ready. We need %, %, %, %...
13491 : Let's get this full-course meal ready. We need %, %, %, %...
13492 : Let's get this full-course meal ready. We need %, %, %, %...

13503 : ...%, and %. Sounds tasty.
13504 : ...%, and %. Shall we start from the top?
13505 : ...%, and %. This may require some serious legwork.
13506 : ...%, and %. Let's do this!
13507 : ...%, and %. I think I finally understand the meaning of decadence.
13508 : ...%, and %. Six items in all.
13509 : ...%, and %. What a pain!
13510 : ...%, and %. Sounds delicious.
13511 : ...%, and %. Where do we start?
13512 : ...%, and %. This may require some serious legwork.
13513 : ...%, and %. Is the Tarutaru digestive system linked to a fourth dimension?
13514 : Two mirrors... There's some secret we're missing here.
13515 : Two mirrors... All this talk of mystery is making me hungry...
13516 : Glass of Blessed Radiance... What connection could it have to the Mirror of Blighted Gloom?
13517 : The Lost Looking Glass... Now there's a book I should like to read.
13518 : Two mirrors... Could there also be an opposing entity to the Glass of All-Seeing?
13519 : Hmmm... I can't help but wonder if there's a reason for there being two mirrors.
13520 : Two mirrors... Sounds kind of romantic.
13521 : Two mirrors... I wonder what the connection is...
13522 : Two mirrors... There's some secret we're missing here.
13523 : Looks like there are two mirrors. What powers does the other one have?
13524 : The Lost Looking Glass... Now there's a book I should like to read.
13525 : The Glass of Blessed Radiance...and the Mirror of Blighted Gloom. The contrasting names suggest much, but reveal little.
13526 : Palometa has had a difficult time, it seems. I hope we can help her out.
13527 : Palometa is a brave little girl. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her!
13528 : Palometa is an unusual child... The daughter of the guardian...
13529 : It seems that Palometa is the true owner of the mirror. I hope for her sake we can locate that unusual metal...
13530 : So the mirror belonged to Palometa. I hope we can fix it.
13531 : All this is too much for young Palometa to handle alone. Let's do what we can to help the little lady!
13532 : Poor Palometa has had it rough. We should do all we can to support her.
13533 : Palometa is a brave little girl. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her!
13534 : Palometa... It must have been scary for her. Let's make sure she stays safe.
13535 : Poor little Palometa. We should do everything we can to help her!
13536 : It seems that Palometa is the true owner of the mirror. I hope for her sake we can locate that unusual metal...
13537 : Palometa has reasons best known to herself. I see no harm in lending a hand.
13538 : The Dark Divinity... Why would anyone want to channel its power?
13539 : Who is this Dark Divinity, anyway? Do you know, %?
13540 : The Dark Divinity... Why would anyone want to channel its power?
13541 : The Dark Divinity... A foreboding title. I wonder if we should be doing this...
13542 : The Dark Divinity... What a scary sounding name... What do you think, %?
13543 : Oooh, the Dark Divinity. This is getting interesting, eh, %?
13544 : The Dark Divinity... Why would anyone want to channel its power?
13545 : The Dark Divinity... I don't think I really want to fix the mirror anymore...
13546 : The Dark Divinity... Should we really be fixing that mirror? I think my instinct in breaking it was the correct one.
13547 : The Dark Divinity... Why would anyone want power from such a scary-sounding source?
13548 : The Dark Divinity... A foreboding title. I wonder if we should be doing this...
13549 : The Dark Divinity... What self-respecting adventurer wouldn't harbor a secret desire to go head-to-head with such a being?
13550 : A spring with a surface as smooth as glass... It would have to be a place with little wind. Like a forest, maybe...
13551 : A spring with a surface as smooth as glass... It would have to be a place with little wind. Like a forest, maybe...

13560 : A spring with a surface as smooth as glass... It would have to be a place with little wind. Like a forest, perhaps...
13561 : A spring with a surface as smooth as glass... It would have to be a place with little wind. Searching in a forest may be our best bet.
13562 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? I have no idea what happened with the Glass of All-Seeing...
13563 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? What was with that light that came from the Glass of All-Seeing...?
13564 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? The Glass of All-Seeing has never done that before...
13565 : Do you recall what happened in Jugner Forest? Does the Glass of All-Seeing also hold some unknown power...?
13566 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? There is so much I still don't know about the Glass of All-Seeing...
13567 : Remember the incident in Jugner Forest? I wonder what happened to the mirror...
13568 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? I have no idea what happened with the Glass of All-Seeing...
13569 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? That was some light that came from the Glass of All-Seeing, huh...?
13570 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? That's the first time the Glass of All-Seeing has done something like that...
13571 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? Maybe the Glass of All-Seeing has some sort of scary powers as well...
13572 : Do you recall what happened in Jugner Forest? Does the Glass of All-Seeing also hold some unknown power...?
13573 : Do you remember what happened in Jugner Forest? The mirror had never before reacted in such a way...
13574 : I wonder if Luto gave the Mirror of Blighted Gloom to Palometa. I'm worried about our little friend...
13575 : I wonder if Luto gave the Mirror of Blighted Gloom to Palometa. I'm worried about our little friend...

13584 : I wonder if Luto gave the Mirror of Blighted Gloom to Palometa. I'm worried about our little friend...
13585 : I wonder if Luto gave the Mirror of Blighted Gloom to Palometa. I cannot help but feel concerned for the young girl.
13586 : While we stand here talking, who knows what poor Palometa must be going through...
13587 : We'll begin our search for Palometa as soon as the mirror is ready...
13588 : We'll start looking for Palometa as soon as the mirror is ready!
13589 : We'll begin our search for Palometa as soon as the mirror is ready...
13590 : We shall begin our search for Palometa as soon as the mirror is stable...

13610 : We can now rescue Palometa with the power of the blessed radiance to assist. Needless to say, you will help too, %.
13611 : We should let Luto know that Palometa is okay.
13612 : We should go let Luto know that Palometa is okay!
13613 : We should let Luto know that Palometa is okay.
13614 : We should inform Luto that Palometa is safe.
13615 : We should tell Luto that Palometa is safe.
13616 : Let's go tell Luto that Palometa is back in safe hands.
13617 : We should let Luto know that Palometa is okay.
13618 : We should go let Luto know that Palometa is okay!

13623 : There's something I need to talk to you about. Can you meet me at the Neptune's Spire?
13624 : There's something I need to talk to you about. Can you meet me at the Neptune's Spire?
13625 : There's something I need to talk to you about. Can you meet me at the Neptune's Spire?

13634 : There's something I wish to speak to you about. Come to the Neptune's Spire.
13635 : I doubt the Glass of All-Seeing will show anything more... It's kind of sad.
13636 : I doubt the Glass of All-Seeing will show anything more... It's kind of sad.
13637 : I doubt the Glass of All-Seeing will show anything more... It's kind of sad.
13638 : I very much doubt the Glass of All-Seeing will show anything more... A sad thought.
13639 : I doubt the Glass of All-Seeing will show anything more... It's kind of sad.
13640 : I doubt the Glass of All-Seeing will show anything more... It's kind of sad.
13641 : I doubt the Glass of All-Seeing will show anything more... It's kind of sad.

13645 : I very much doubt the Glass of All-Seeing will show anything more... A sad thought.
13646 : So the Glass of All-Seeing will show nothing more... A sad thought.
13647 : You don't mind me using weapon skills with area effect, right?
13648 : What do you think about me using weapon skills with area effect?
13649 : Are you cool with me using weapon skills with area effect?
13650 : Do you have any objections to my usage of weapon skills with area effect?
13651 : Can I use weapon skills with area effect?
13652 : You don't mind me using weapon skills with area effect, right?
13653 : What do you think about me using weapon skills with area effect?
13654 : Is it cool for me to use weapon skills with area effect?
13655 : I can use weapon skills with area effect...unless you don't want me to?
13656 : Is it okay if I use weapon skills with area effect?
13657 : Do you have any objections to my usage of weapon skills with area effect?
13658 : I can apply weapon skills with area effect to our battle strategy...unless you'd prefer otherwise?
13659 : Okay to use weapon skills with area effect? No, don't use them. Sure, go ahead.
13660 : A Mithran lady? I'm sorry, but I haven't seen the person you describe. It's almostaru time for my patrol, though--I'll let you know if I see her.
13661 : Speaking of Mithra, that reminds me of the time one of those wily-smiley felines snuck into the guard post.
13662 : I immediately gave chase, but lost track of the intruder. Even though no real harm was done, it still irky-wirks me to be given the slip like that...
13663 : You must excuse me. Duty calls.
13664 : Oh yeah, now I remember. I used the knitted cap when...
13665 : Intruders! Halt!
13666 : Haltaru, I say!
13667 : I have you now...
13668 : Nowhere left to run!
13669 : Waaah! Lemme go! I ain't done nothin'!
13670 : You...you're just a kiddy-wink!?
13671 : Waaah! Lemme go, you mean lady!
13672 : Alrightaru, alrightaru. There's no need to get upset...
13673 : It seems I've made a mistake. My apologies.
13674 : Don't hurt me! I promise I'll be good!
13675 : Calm down, no one's going to hurtaru you. What are you doing out at this latey-wate hour, anyway? Be on your way home, child.
13676 : That was quite a performance I put on... I wish you could've seen it.
13677 : Let me take a look at that cap.
13678 : I should've known! There's a big hole in it!
13679 : Wha...where? It must've been when that guard grabbed me... How am I supposed to sell it now?
13680 : Shouldn't you be more worried about getting back to your norrrmal self?
13681 : It'll be okay--you'll see!
13682 : Oh, %, there you are.
13683 : I have a favor to ask. Could you track down and buy % without our little friend here noticing?
13684 : It's used when amateurs dabble in costume magic and make a mess of things. He's too prrroud to go out and find some for himself.
13685 : You should be able to purchase % from a goods store in Bastok. I would really apprrreciate it, %.
13686 : All clear!
13687 : Were you waiting for me? I'm sorry, but there was no sign of your Mithran friend. You might have better luck in a different partaru of the city.
13688 : %, I have been looking for you. Come. We have confidential matters to discuss.
13689 : I must speak with you regarding the Wyrmking Bahamut.
13690 : You may recall him returning to the heavens, but I have received confirmation that he has once again descended upon Cape Riverne.
13691 : Judging from the activity of the wyrms remaining in the various regions of Vana'diel, I suspected that they had yet to regain their faith in mankind.
13692 : Most importantly, Tavnazia is in danger. Prishe and Ulmia have already been informed. I assume that you will also lend them your aid.
13693 : Help out? Yes. Not yet.
13694 : Then you should head to Cape Riverne. Prishe and Ulmia have probably already departed.
13695 : I see you have other matters to attend to. I know that you would not turn your back on Prishe and Ulmia, though.
13696 : I am sure we have a little time. Return here when you are ready.
13697 : I don't understand. Bahamut is nowhere to be found in Monarch Linn! We've searched all over the south side...
13698 : We must be looking on the wrong side. Let's try again, Prishe.
13699 : %?
13700 : I'm so glad you're here! Nothing could reassure me more than your presence.
13701 : A member of the Tavnazian Patrol witnessed Bahamut returning to Cape Riverne with an army of wyrms.
13702 : We've looked all over the south side, but Bahamut is nowhere to be found. We're about to begin searching the north side, now.
13703 : It will take a while to search every island, so I think we should split up.
13704 : Let's go, Prishe.
13705 : Oh %, I am simply delighted to see you again!
13706 : Surprised? I'm a regular girl now, you know! Tehehe!
13707 : So, it's you. I knew we would meet again, but I must say, this is sooner than I expected.
13708 : You have done well, but you are naive to think that your troubles would end so easily.
13709 : What are you planning!?
13710 : Your friend here held in her body a crystallized form of the Emptiness. You returned it to the mothercrystals, did you not?
13711 : ...!
13712 : I sense the will that embodied the Emptiness. It has yet to awaken into this world, but it is tremendously powerful.
13713 : The mothercrystals are already beginning to feel its effects, enveloped in the Emptiness as they are. It is stirring...
13714 : My magicite...
13715 : Mankind will be annihilated. You have simply delayed the process.
13716 : Do you dare to defy fate once again and fight to preserve your lives?
13717 : Defy fate and fight? Fight and live! Fate is inevitable.
13718 : Children of Vana'diel! [Stand in defiance/Accept your fate] and perish! Redeem the world as a part of the mothercrystals!
13719 : You have delayed mankind's extinction yet again...
13720 : An age is a mere flicker to a wyrm. However, enough flickers united form a star.
13721 : Children of Vana'diel. Unite and form a future in which mankind can survive.
13722 : Let's go home for now, Prishe.
13723 : Okay...
13724 : %, please tell Cardinal Mildaurion about this the next time you are in Jeuno.
13725 : The Star of Tavnazia... The stone Prishe released when Promathia was defeated...
13726 : The children of Vana'diel harbor the Emptiness inside their bodies, even if just a small amount. I envisioned it causing problems before too many thousands of years passed.
13727 : However, I never dreamed that we would face such a threat so soon.
13728 : We have no choice now but to stop Bahamut.
13729 : I have a feeling that he was waiting for you, desiring a confrontation.
13730 : Bahamut pays respect to the strong, regardless of stature. It is for that reason he is called the Wyrmking.
13731 : You must gather an army of adventurers and challenge him yet again. Show our adversary the strength of mankind!
13732 : As for me, I will conduct a thorough investigation of the emanations coming from the mothercrystals. Perhaps I will find something of interest.
13733 : If you can unlock all the secrets of Vana'diel, we may meet again. I hope with every fabric of my being that that time will come.
13734 : % uses %!
13735 : % uses %, but nothing happens.
13736 : We must make preparations and consult with Cardinal Mildaurion.
13737 : %, there is someone I would like you to meet. Please come this way...
13738 : I have a fair idea of what's going on. It's surprising to find a Zilartian with a level head on her shoulders.
13739 : There are four mothercrystal locations: the Crag of Holla, the Crag of Dem, the Crag of Mea, and the ruins of Pso'Xja.
13740 : Our investigation into the Emptiness surrounding these locations has produced some unusual readings.
13741 : We put together a research team equipped with the latest weapons--weapons designed to combat the Emptiness--and sent them to Pso'Xja.
13742 : And you wouldn't guess who they encountered...
13743 : The ruins of Pso'Xja are under Tenshodo authority. Technically speaking, your researchers were trespassing.
13744 : Verena had wandered down there like she was being guided by something.
13745 : I found this at the place to where I was drawn.
13746 : Apparently it belonged to a Galka known as Raogrimm--I'm sure you remember the name.
13747 : Verena was once the receptacle for the memories of the Shadow Lord. This must be the reason behind her behavior.
13748 : Similar readings have been recorded from the Emptiness found below the crags of Holla, Dem, and Mea.
13749 : We have marked the points where the fluctuations were the strongest. I would like to entrust the investigation of these areas to you, %.
13750 : If my intuition on what lies out there is correct, you will make some fascinating discoveries indeed.
13751 : You're a brave soul, %. You'll never catch me in that awful place again. Once is more than enough...
13752 : Please be careful. We'll be praying for your safe return.
13753 : So these are what were causing such unusual activity within the Emptiness.
13754 : I can feel the aura of those who returned to the mothercrystals...
13755 : Nag'molada, Eald'narche, and even Archduke Kam'lanaut...
13756 : Could it be possible that these entities are attempting to break back into this world?
13757 : Will they return as they once were? Or as something more sinister?
13758 : %. We must put a stop to this.
13759 : These reincarnations are beings that have chosen--and been chosen by--the Emptiness.
13760 : Go. Prepare yourself for battle, then return to me here. Let us raise the curtain on the final conflict.
13761 : I fear their powers will be beyond any race that has walked Vana'diel.
13762 : You hand the three crystal slivers to Esha'ntarl.
13763 : %. Let us discuss what needs to be done.
13764 : I have returned from an audience with the Wyrmking.
13765 : If the Keeper of the Apocalypse is indeed attempting to cross over into this world, there is but one option left to us.
13766 : We force the keeper to appear on our terms. Then we crush him.
13767 : This was Prishe's original plan.
13768 : Ulmia will sing the Lay of the Immortals in the presence of the fifth mothercrystal.
13769 : The time has finally come to use the completed song--the verses you discovered on your journey. I have faith that Ulmia can perform the piece with little trouble.
13770 : Make your way to the Sealion's Den in Tavnazia. Al'Taieu beckons once again.
13771 : %, I have awaited your arrival.
13772 : It is my fault that this terrible thing is occurring--I have no excuses.
13773 : I always feared that my act of relinquishing the Star of Tavnazia...
13774 : ...would one day bring the world back to the brink of destruction.
13775 : But to be completely honest, I am overjoyed that this darkness has given us another chance to meet. Truly, I am...
13776 : Prishe! You stop this nonsense at once!
13777 : Why must you insist on playing the clown at a time like this!? You truly are incorrigible!
13778 : Aw, c'mon, Ulmia! It's been so long since I've seen %.
13779 : A normal reunion would be kinda boring, and I just wanted to spice things up a little...
13780 : You were just trying to cover up your own awkwardness!
13781 : That's...not...true...
13782 : Oh! Hey, there's the [/Ultra /Hyper /Psycho /Eternal /Neo /Lovely /Pretty /Final /Extra /Deadly /Savage /Aero /Pseudo /Universal /Exciting /Celestial /Super /Mighty /Mega /Omni /Poly ][/Terror /Perfect /Royale /Gorgeous /Pretty /Hell /Fantasy /Stealth /Powerful /Invincible /Explosive /Storm /Fantastic /Duper /Go-Go /Morphing /Retro /Sonic /Cloud /Sky /Stellar ][/Hyper /Neo /Lovely /Happy /Caller /Hound /XI /Armored /Brutal /Buster /Alpha /Chief /Provoker /Mincer /Streak /King /Prince /Power /Robo /Delver /Mystic ][C.I.D./Enterprise/Nautilus/Gilgamemnon/Redwing/Blackjack/Falcon/Highwind/Ragnarok/Hilda Garde/Prima Vista/Red Rose/Fahrenheit]!
13783 : %. Cardinal Mildaurion will be joining us later. Let us begin our journey to the fifth mothercrystal.
13784 : Our mission will be a success. I know it in my heart.
13785 : Prishe, Ulmia, %!
13786 : You seem surprised. Well, our last parting of ways did seem somewhat final.
13787 : But you couldn't expect us to stay at home shivering in our fur when word of this rrreached us!
13788 : As the...Moblins say... Don't leave...a hole...half...dug...
13789 : Are we digging holes?
13790 : For the graves?
13791 : Not very optimistic, are we!
13792 : I never thought I would don this armor again. Cardinal Mildaurion is not one to be ignored.
13793 : Wow, the whole gang's here. All because of my selfish mistake...
13794 : My apologies... And my thanks!
13795 : The time has come. On to the mothercrystal!
13796 : Hehehe. I always wanted to come back to this place. Y'know, for a picnic or something.
13797 : Still making unrealistic wishes, Prishe?
13798 : Miss Mildaurion! Aldo!?
13799 : I'm sure you all know Zeid. We have a debt to the ancients that needs to be repaid.
13800 : I will also fight alongside you. I must see this matter put to rest.
13801 : Here they come!
13802 : Bound together...
13803 : By the crystals...
13804 : We will soon...
13805 : Become one...
13806 : There's something else...!
13807 : A fifth person!?
13808 : Lion!?
13809 : Hahaha!
13810 : The stone she would not relinquish...!
13811 : It has been shattered by your song...!
13812 : Our divine transformation is at hand!
13813 : This ends now!
13814 : Leave Nag'molada to me!
13815 : You shall be the first...!
13816 : The first to taste the vengeance of the dead!
13817 : I think we're done here.
13818 : Yes, the battle is over. There is only...
13819 : She appears to be unharmed. There is some trace of Emptiness, but it will cause nothing more than a few bad dreams.
13820 : Thank Altana... It was Lion who leaped into the crystal to save us all.
13821 : Her struggle with Eald'narche continued within the stone...
13822 : Let's get her home to Norg...
13823 : Your red hair... Now I know you.
13824 : The nightmare I had... You were the one who carried it on for me.
13825 : %. Make sure you fulfill your promise when she gets better, okay?
13826 : The world only grows larger the longer we live. New lives are born, and new lands are discovered. There're always new adventures to be had.
13827 : But you don't gotta rush in, you know? This big world of ours will always be waiting.
13828 : Waiting for you.
13829 : %'s badge flashes brightly.
13830 : The Near East must be in a dire condition to send mercenary recruiters all the way to Jeuno...
13831 : I heard many tales of the Great War from my dear departed father. They all seemed irrelevant to me until now...
13832 : I see you've got a Salaheem's Sentinel badge there... They must be desperate to use those as an attention-grabbing device.
13833 : Maybe the empress of Aht Urhgan is short on devoted subjects...
13834 : Hm? I see you have one of those brass badges that Salaheem's Sentinels are handing out unauthorized. Let me take a look at it.
13835 : Interesting. Objects from the Near East seem to shine with a different light. I've heard that the president of Salaheem's Sentinels is quite tight-fisted, but at least this badge is quite luxurious.
13836 : Near Eastern cuisine is all the rage now. Lately I've been studying up on it to add some spice to the palace banquets.
13837 : Near Eastern cooking is considered one of the leading cuisines in Vana'diel, so I am sure the archduke will be most pleased.
13838 : Lately, the Empire of Aht Urhgan has been building up her army. That's sure to make waves internationally...
13839 : Do you think we can continue to preserve friendly relations with all three major nations as the balance of power hangs by a thread?
13840 : You have gathered here today at the request of the Kingdom of San d'Oria. I thank you on behalf of the king.
13841 : This is the first time in history that an emergency summit of this nature has taken place. The issue I lay before you is beyond the scope of a single nation...
13842 : Prince Pieuje! The adventurer you have permitted to attend the summit has arrived.
13843 : Thank you for coming, %.
13844 : Allow me to begin by explaining the events that have led to today's meeting.
13845 : It began when %, mercenary and adventurer, arrived at the gate of the Chateau d'Oraguille bearing a letter of extreme importance.
13846 : The contents of that letter prompted me to call the nations together...
13847 : It was penned by a sage known as Raillefal, and described in painstaking detail the current state of Aht Urhgan.
13848 : This is the same nation that has the port in a frenzy over mercenary recruitment...?
13849 : The very same. I speak of the Near Eastern nation, the Empire of Aht Urhgan.
13850 : The Empire!?
13851 : Aht Urhgan is now under pressure from three separate beastman armies, and Al Zahbi, the mighty capital itself, is in danger of falling.
13852 : Great Altana...
13853 : The Silent Empire...
13854 : It was once called that.
13855 : You may have been too young to know this, Your Highness, but the rest of us should remember.
13856 : ...
13857 : I am aware of the term.
13858 : In the time of the Great War, the Empire possessed an army greater than the combined forces of the allied nations.
13859 : Yet not a single soldier was sent in response to calls for aid...
13860 : My apologies. You are well versed in history.
13861 : But knowing this, you should also know that we have no obligation to lift even a finger for Aht Urhgan, no matter how serious her predicament.
13862 : Why, Volker, always so calm and cool. You've grown hot and bothered, and your speech is most cruel.
13863 : You should understand, Doctor Shantotto.
13864 : You were there on that battlefield. Who knows how much suffering could've been avoided if we'd had the help of the Empire...
13865 : On the contrary, my dear musketeer. We owe them more than you can imagine, I fear.
13866 : What do you mean!?
13867 : Aht Urhgan has taken many countries under her yoke...
13868 : A ferocious nation that has even bared fangs at the Far Eastern folk.
13869 : Calling the Empire to help in our cause, would be like freeing us from demons in return for dragon jaws.
13870 : That may be true, but even the close relationship Aht Urhgan had with Tavnazia...
13871 : That subject is not--
13872 : ...the issue here, I know. Doctor Shantotto, why did Windurst open Mhaura's port to the Empire?
13873 : My nation's actions are none of your concern.
13874 : At least we have a backbone--when will Bastok learn...?
13875 : You go too far, Doctor Shantotto...
13876 : Enough! I did not call you here to speak of possible troop contributions.
13877 : Then why are we here, Your Highness?
13878 : Our main concern is the treasure thought to be at the center of this conflict--the Astral Candescence.
13879 : Astral Candescence?
13880 : It is described as some manner of musical instrument, but apparently is much more than that.
13881 : This instrument is said to produce a phenomenon known as the Astral Wind, a breeze that blows from an unidentifiable source.
13882 : It creates a melody in a timbre unheard by mortal ears...
13883 : I'm confused. How can there be a melody if nothing can be heard...?
13884 : Astral Wind...
13885 : Hmph. This is all very unusual, but I'm sure we've all seen stranger things before.
13886 : An unidentifiable source...
13887 : In Windurst there is no shortage of magical gadgets. Pens that write by themselves. Brooms that sweep on command...
13888 : A breeze...
13889 : I mean, they even have that Cardian band. That's similar, don't you think, Doctor Shantotto?
13890 : Astral...
13891 : Wind...
13892 : Doctor Shantotto? Is everything alright?
13893 : !!!
13894 : Ohohohoho!
13895 : If it's automatic instruments you need, our children make such things before they learn how to read!
13896 : The problem lies in the power of the wind.
13897 : The wind?
13898 : It envelops those close by, and fills them with a mysterious strength. There are few who can resist the lure of this energy.
13899 : Even among the beastmen...
13900 : If the instrument is that dangerous, why not just give it to the beastmen, or smash it out of hand?
13901 : That is what common sense would tell us. If it were up to an individual, or even an entire town...
13902 : What are you trying to say?
13903 : What if that decision lay in the hands of a nation?
13904 : Even if it posed a threat to your own citizens, if that treasure could one day be your salvation, would you not choose to protect it?
13905 : How could a mere instrument hold that kind of power...?
13906 : The sage who composed this letter is afraid...
13907 : Afraid that this Astral Candescence will one day be the catalyst for a conflict to rival the Crystal War.
13908 : No!
13909 : Prince Pieuje... As a representative for an entire nation, you would do well not to throw those words around so lightly!
13910 : My apologies. This is merely based on the conjecture of a sage.
13911 : Why don't we have %, who has seen and heard these things in person, give us [his/her] account?
13912 : ...
13913 : We cannot make a decision based on this tale alone.
13914 : A nation has a responsibility to maintain soldiers and weaponry for the defense of its people.
13915 : And for a city in this situation, I would go so far as to say that some sort of secret weapon is almost a necessity.
13916 : In any case, it doesn't seem that this Astral Candescence presents any immediate danger to the people of Al Zahbi.
13917 : I wouldn't say that was entirely true, if you were me, and I were you.
13918 : %. I came to a conclusion after you left the chateau.
13919 : I wish to hear your honest opinion.
13920 : Give Pieuje your honest opinion? Yes. No.
13921 : Excellent. I knew asking you here was the right decision. I rely upon your vast experience as an adventurer.
13922 : Ahaha. Only an adventurer would choose to jest in such company as this.
13923 : What is the Astral Candescence?
13924 : If it is such an important treasure, then why not secret it away inside the palace instead of placing it in the area most vulnerable to beastman attacks?
13925 : I sense some hidden purpose for this dangerous object...
13926 : Do you have any thoughts on the matter, %?
13927 : Any thoughts? Sage Walahra... The Gordeus... The Walahra Philosophy... Not really...
13928 : %. If you have nothing to contribute, then there is little point in you being here...
13929 : Sage Walahra? What manner of person is this?
13930 : ...I see.
13931 : The father of the Walahra Philosophy and an alchemist of great renown...
13932 : I, alone, do not possess all the answers. Let us ponder the mysteries of the universe together.
13933 : Shared knowledge is the shortest path to enlightenment...
13934 : Hmm. Not a philosophy that would appeal to my brother...
13935 : Is Prince Trion somehow involved...?
13936 : Ah, forgive me. I was merely thinking aloud...
13937 : The Gordeus. I have heard this name somewhere before...
13938 : What manner of person is this?
13939 : Not a person? So, it is a holy relic enshrined in Walahra Temple...
13940 : In the distant past, Sage Walahra once unraveled the Gordeus and grasped the fundamental principle of existence...
13941 : And now a host of like-minded scholars toil day and night to discover the same loose thread to unravel the Gordeus for themselves.
13942 : It appears the people of the Empire search for quite different truths than the ones we seek...
13943 : The Walahra Philosophy? What manner of learning is this?
13944 : What connection does this philosophy have to the Astral Candescence?
13945 : From the void all things are born. To the void all things return.
13946 : I do not understand what this void they speak of refers to.
13947 : Though this philosophy is not so far from our own belief that all life begins and ends with Great Altana and the mothercrystals...
13948 : Ohohoho! Too much time in the cathedral for Destin's little boy! The mind is a tool you must sharpen, not a child's toy!
13949 : Do you mock me, Doctor Shantotto!?
13950 : You look for your answers in all the wrong places. Shall I bring a little hope to your long, dreary faces?
13951 : What are you hiding, Shantotto?
13952 : The servants of Walahra control the Hall of Binding--the treasure's little nest.
13953 : The Hall of Binding is defended by the Serpent Generals--the best of the best!
13954 : The Serpent Generals? A name I have heard. Each one is said to be worth a thousand soldiers.
13955 : The Astral Candescence is strictly monitored by the Walahra Temple, according to the adventurer's speech...
13956 : But the treasure is kept in an area that the beastmen can easily reach.
13957 : And there we find the Serpent Generals, the strongest of the strong...
13958 : Plus mercenaries like % to help them, if I'm not wrong?
13959 : Yes, there does seem to be some contradiction to be found here.
13960 : You see...
13961 : This is a huge game of set the trap and wait. And the Astral Candescence is the very tasty bait!
13962 : ...!
13963 : Of course! Why didn't I see it?
13964 : But wait. This creates a whole new set of questions. Why would they want the beastmen in the city?
13965 : There are some things that even I cannot divine. It's time to sit back and wait for a sign.
13966 : But it does seem that this problem lies at the center of some grand plan.
13967 : Without concern for the people of Al Zahbi...
13968 : We need more information.
13969 : Yes. An individual of keen wits and sharp senses...
13970 : My lords, I have a suggestion.
13971 : % is employed as a mercenary in the Empire.
13972 : However, [she/he] is a distinguished adventurer, who will not sell [his/her] principles for a bag of gil.
13973 : I point to the safe delivery of the sage's letter as proof of [his/her] dedication.
13974 : A long journey without promise of reward.
13975 : And I am sure that all of you present have had numerous beneficial dealings with adventurers.
13976 : They have earned our trust and respect!
13977 : That is why I put forth the motion that we have % return to the Empire and fight as a mercenary.
13978 : We cannot allow any more blood to be spilled by beastmen, even should that blood belong to another nation's people.
13979 : And if % can improve [his/her] standing enough to bring [him/her] closer to the Imperial palace...
13980 : We may learn the ultimate goal of the Empire.
13981 : You'll find no argument here. Adventurers have been the quiet heroes in many of Bastok's darker moments.
13982 : An idea that creates less work for us, will not find me making a needless fuss!
13983 : How does the Duchy of Jeuno stand on this?
13984 : In agreement.
13985 : The linking of our auction house services has strengthened the ties between Jeuno and the Empire, but economical matters are superseded by politics...
13986 : All in favor...?
13987 : One moment. As Raillefal warned, this problem is not likely to remain constrained within the borders of the Near East.
13988 : All the lands of Vana'diel, including our four nations...
13989 : Urhguum is the word for world in the language of Aht Urhgan, and this lurking threat could plunge it entirely into chaos.
13990 : We lay this mission before you, %. Will you consent to take up this burden?
13991 : Take up the burden? That's what I'm here for! What am I, a donkey?
13992 : You have our thanks, %.
13993 : Naturally, we will do all in our power to aid you in this task.
13994 : It is a trifling amount, but perhaps you might use this Aht Urhgan coin on your travels.
13995 : An adventurer is free to choose [his/her] own path...
13996 : However, what I ask of you is for the sake of all Vana'diel. I am sure that when the time comes, I can rely on you to perform your duty.
13997 : That treasure is more than simple bait...
13998 : An astral relic can and will seal your fate.
13999 : The Empress goes too far in her game. I'm curious to see how it turns out, all the same...
14000 : DEBUG:02
14001 : You cannot obtain the %. Please change areas and come back to this location after sorting your inventory.
14002 : Well met! I'm a Merry Map Marker, and I'd love to make marks all over your merry %, but it appears you are missing the markable map I mention.
14003 : Good day! I'm a Merry Map Marker, and I'd be emphatically ecstatic if you'd allow me to mark your magical map!
14004 : A markless % is like a motherless maiden, meandering through a miasmatic mire of misery.
14005 : Embark on a map-marking mission? Mark me up! Keep your mitts off my map!
14006 : Marvelous! Now allow me a minute to make all my marks.
14007 : Methinks I have marked your map with as many marks as I might manage.
14008 : Monitoring and managing your marks is as simple as merely opening your map and selecting Markers from the main menu.
14009 : If the marks on your map might vanish, mope not like a melancholy milksop. Make another meeting with me and I shall make it my mission to mark the map once more.
14010 : Good day, [milord/milady]. May your marches across meadow and mountain be markedly memorable!
14011 : Here is the area's home point. Once set, your muted remains will be moved here if you are ever...mortally mangled in the midst of a melee.
14012 : Here you will find the immigration ministers. They will help you if you may wish to immediately modify your nationality.
14013 : And mayhap you are immeasurably motivated to compete in the medieval mayhem of Conflict? Might I suggest you mingle with the modest Pursuivant located here?
14014 : Our local minstrel of melodies can be found here. His mirthful musicalities may help you recall misplaced memories.
14015 : Ah, and in the case you might wish to mask a meritorious moniker and replace it with one a mite more merited, a traveling bard strums upon his mellifluous harp here.
14016 : Here, you may meet with a member of the Specialty Goods Trade Union. And, if you are a citizen of this mighty dominion, he'll teleport you all across Vana'diel (for a menial amount of monetary remuneration).
14017 : Need to know the local weather? Our local meteorologist will be making his paramount presumptions here.
14018 : If you wish to summon a merciful mate to this mighty realm, here is where you will find a merry merchant marketing Gold World Passes.
14019 : Those men and women wondering how their deeds are mirrored in the minds of the locals should meander over to this gossip-meister to muster up important material on their respective reputations.
14020 : The armor depository located here will help you maintain any old sets of equipment muddling up your immaculate Mog House.
14021 : And here is the item depository where you may store much of your festive furniture, etcetera until misplaced holiday merriment makes it way back into your miserly heart.
14022 : Let me begin with Southern San d'Oria.
14023 : Now I shall move to Northern San d'Oria.
14024 : And last, but not least, let me mark your map for Port San d'Oria.
14025 : I shall start with Port Bastok and its magnificent drawbridge.
14026 : Now let me move on to the mercantile metropolis known as the Bastok Markets.
14027 : And after the markets, come the massive Bastok Mines.
14028 : And finally, who could forget the marveled Bastok Metalworks, where masterful minds from across the Republic meet to mull over the mysteries of man-made mechanical marvels.
14029 : Let me start with the Windurst Waters.
14030 : Let me continue by marking your map of Windurst Walls.
14031 : And while I am at it, let me see your map of Heavens Tower.
14032 : Next, I shall mark your map of Windurst Woods.
14033 : And finally, let me mark your map of Port Windurst.
14034 : I shall begin by marking the important locations on your map of the Ru'Lude Gardens.
14035 : Next, let me mark your map of Upper Jeuno. Did you know that I often frequent the Marble Bridge whenever I have a free moment? There's just something about the name of that model establishment...
14036 : Now let me mark your map of Lower Jeuno.
14037 : And finally, I shall mark your map of Port Jeuno.
14038 : %!
14039 : <Huff>...You're about to enter the council? Glad to see you made it in time.
14040 : Right, then! This way to the meeting room!
14041 : But before you go in, why don't you take a few moments to gather your thoughts?
14042 : I mean, they've been going at this for hours--I doubt they'll miss you a couple minutes more.
14044 : As I've already stated numerous times, it is in our best interests to prevent the completion of the Empire's secret weapon, this iron colossus of theirs.
14045 : Bastok is prepared to employ military action to accomplish this goal--without your support, if necessary.
14046 : I am in full agreement with the captain in this case. The Empire's intentions are clear--we must not lose this race.
14047 : But if we mobilize our forces, we will be giving the Grand Vizier and his supporters just the ammunition they need to fuel a full-scale war.
14048 : The Empress yet retains loyal subjects within Her realm. I believe we can still avoid open confrontation.
14049 : Ohohoho...so unlike you, my dear prince. Your sentimental view of the situation is making me wince.
14050 : If I'm not mistaken, Your Highness, wasn't it one of your agents that described the Empress's position as little more than a puppet on the throne?
14051 : I...
14052 : This will be a conflict of epic proportions. Perhaps we should strive harder for a diplomatic solution...
14053 : While I agree with you in theory, we walk a dangerous line.
14054 : Despite its state of constant warfare, the sprawling Empire commands staggering resources. If we fail to make the first move, we could face casualties on the scale of the Great War.
14055 : The Great War? Surely you jest? The carnage from this apocalypse will be far greater than all the rest.
14056 : Worse than the Great War?
14057 : You all know of the Gordeus, I presume? It is best we're all aware of this potential source of doom.
14058 : One does not lightly forget such an object...
14059 : You speak of the sacred artifact kept within the Walahra Temple?
14060 : An amazing creation worthy of mention.
14061 : But that is not the phenomenon to which I wish to draw your attention.
14062 : I refer to an event from nine hundred years before...
14063 : The supernova that was born from the earth and stole the night sky for an entire year, as was passed down in lore.
14064 : Ah, now this I recall from my lessons! This was the miracle bestowed by the Goddess that marked the beginning of the Crystal Era.
14065 : After the glare finally faded, this star of the first magnitude became part of the Alexander constellation, correct?
14066 : It was merely a coincidence that the supernova's trajectory passed in front of that star. The truth of the matter is more fascinating by far.
14067 : The trajectory? I don't understand.
14068 : I discovered an ancient papyrus in the extensive vaults of the Optistery.
14069 : The following was written in a script bold and flowery:
14070 : When the light deity clashed with the dark, rent in twain were the heavens, and devastated was the earth by a storm beyond comprehension.
14071 : I must admit to feeling a degree of shock, for this simple passage described the arrival of Ragnarok...
14072 : Ragnarok... The northern legend that tells of the twilight of the gods? You mean to tell us that this supernova was in fact the aftermath of a battle between divinities?
14073 : Oh, so close to the mark. Shall I endeavor to bring you out of the dark?
14074 : This is my hypothesis based on the facts at hand...
14075 : The old Empire of Aht Urhgan launched their iron colossus, imbued with the spirit of the light deity, high into the air, and attempted to dominate the entire land.
14076 : The nation that revered a rival deity was unsurprisingly not amused. They sent up their Dark Rider born from sacrifice and with utter darkness infused.
14077 : A fierce battle raged in the skies, and eventually both combatants fell to earth--the giant in pieces, and the rider with grave wounds to his material form.
14078 : But this titanic struggle had blasted the land into ruin, and left a void in the heavens that spawned a cataclysmic storm...
14079 : An apocalypse...
14080 : What a ridiculous story. How could an iron colossus be made to fly?
14081 : And what does this have to do with the name of the Gordeus?
14082 : We Tarutaru have always been notoriously fussy about our cuisine. The name was probably heard from a trader in foreign goods, is what I mean.
14083 : The name of the colossus's heart, given to a star...
14084 : We have let ourselves be distracted by the candescences. The Gordeus should have been our true concern.
14085 : We can only hope that the Grand Vizier has failed to notice the true value of the treasure under his nose. We must hurry to bring this matter to a close.
14086 : Naji reporting in! I've brought % back with me!
14087 : You're late. Where in Altana's name have you been!?
14088 : Take it easy, Ayame.
14089 : %, we are grateful you could come. Your insight will be invaluable.
14090 : Please, describe to us your impressions of the events unfolding in the Empire...
14091 : Thanks to your talents, gaining the program data we needed was far less complicated than expected.
14092 : But the Empress appears to have only a tentative hold on consciousness...
14093 : It is nothing to be concerned about. When reading someone's memories with my altered...perspective...it occasionally releases images and thoughts sealed deep within the mind.
14094 : This state of regression is only temporary. She will recover in time...
14095 : Let us begin.
14096 : So...this day has finally come.
14097 : That voice!
14098 : If it isn't Nashmeira, then who...?
14099 : I know not who you are, but it appears you have completed construction of Alzadaal and unraveled the Gordeus.
14100 : Congratulations are in order! You will soon hold the most awe-inspiring weapon in Urhguum in the palm of your hand--the power of light.
14101 : Father...!?
14102 : But the power of Alexander is a double-edged sword.
14103 : Mother!
14104 : The infinite energy of a star... The legends--not to mention the ruins--speak eloquently of the destruction that will befall should you make a single misstep.
14105 : It is not too late. If you possess a shred of compassion, you will halt the program immediately. We hope you choose the wiser course...
14106 : Hmph...a cunning trick, Nashmeira. Defiant until the last.
14107 : ...
14108 : !!!
14109 : Behold! This is the will of Alexander!
14110 : I fear no legend or signs of past failures. I will carve out my own destiny.
14111 : ...?
14112 : O-Ovjang...?
14113 : Mnejing!?
14114 : No...
14115 : Noooooo...!!!
14116 : ...
14117 : Thank you, %. I am sure we all felt the immediacy of your experiences.
14118 : And if we can believe the words of the Grand Vizier, a war with the Empire seems inevitable.
14119 : I'm afraid I have to agree with you...
14120 : Then, a war it shall be. Preparations must be made with all urgency.
14121 : Bastok's armada is ready to sail. Once I give the order, the seas will be ours.
14122 : Are we committed?
14123 : Ohohoho. Our amphibious cardian advance units were already given the order to deploy. They lay hidden in the Wajaom Woodlands, primed and waiting to destroy.
14124 : Already deployed...? Was the decision of this council a forgone conclusion?
14125 : ...
14126 : N-now hold on a minute!
14127 : !!!
14128 : From what I could gather from %'s explanation, this Luzaf character wants to prevent Ragnarok as much as we do.
14129 : Naji! Remember your station!
14130 : And the Empress is of the same mind...isn't that right, %?
14131 : The way I see it, there's no need to go head-to-head with the Empire's forces.
14132 : If we can spirit Luzaf out of their clutches, then we can at least put a stop to this Ragnarok business.
14133 : We might even get a chance to restore authority to the Empress while we're at it.
14134 : Ayame, %...we've all been to Aht Urhgan.
14135 : We've seen the lives, the smiles, the tears of her people...
14136 : The citizens of the Empire are as much the children of Altana as we are. War should be considered only after every other avenue has been exhausted.
14137 : Naji...
14138 : Ohohohohoho. A voice of reason from Bastok, the nation of mines and gloom?
14139 : And you would plan this strategy yourself, I assume?
14140 : What? Um, y-yes! Of course!
14141 : Wonderful. I admire your ambition. I shall offer the latest model of cardian to escort you on this mission.
14142 : Thank you, Doctor Shantotto!
14143 : Very well. Then you shall have two veteran knights to accompany you as well.
14144 : And from Jeuno, you will have the use of our fastest airship, with an ace pilot at the wheel.
14145 : Prince Trion, Sir Wolfgang...
14146 : It appears I have no choice. I will inform the president of this operation myself.
14147 : Captain Volker! Then I should--
14148 : On one condition!
14149 : % is to go with you. Will you accompany Naji?
14150 : Join the mission to rescue Luzaf? Count me in! I just left the Empire...
14151 : It will be dangerous, but please lend Naji your experience and expertise.
14152 : It will be dangerous, but I will feel better knowing Naji is accompanied by someone I know I can trust.
14153 : Looking forward to working with you, %!
14154 : Excellent. I will have Pherimociel prepare your transportation at once.
14155 : I understand. Not many would be willing to throw themselves back into the dragon's lair so soon after escaping it.
14156 : I see... I understand it will be dangerous, but I believe you would be up to the task, %.
14157 : Well, then, I guess I'll have to make do without [him/her]...
14158 : No, Naji. Without %, I will not allow this reckless plan to go ahead.
14159 : In any case, Captain Volker, I will have Pherimociel prepare an airship for departure.
14160 : %. Speak to Pherimociel should you change your mind. You can find him in the Ducal Guard Post.
14161 : I'm sure we all have urgent tasks to attend to. I declare this session of the council at an end.
14162 : May our actions find Altana's fortune!
14163 : Ready to leave? Ready. Not yet.
14164 : What is it? Do I look like a tour guide?
14165 : !!!
14166 : Ah! My apologies! You're here for the Wajaom Infiltration Operation, correct?
14167 : The airship Endymion is all fueled up and going through a final flight check.
14168 : Are you ready for deployment, %?
14169 : Are you ready? Ready. Not yet.
14170 : Understood. I have orders from Sir Wolfgang to hold the Endymion at port until you are aboard.
14171 : Please inform me when your preparations are complete.
14172 : Very well. Please continue into the courtyard.
14173 : The other members of your team are assembled and waiting. Everyone except your mission leader...Naji, was it?
14174 : %! It iS gOoD toseE yOu. DoyoU rEmEmbErtHe KiNg?
14175 : I muSTaPoLogiZE foR MyaCTioNs LAsttiME We mET.

14178 : Wow, you all got here fast...
14179 : Or am I a little late?
14180 : YoU aReLAte, TeAM LeaDErNaJi!
14181 : My apologies. I brought a secret weapon from Bastok, and had a devil of a time getting it unwrapped...
14182 : SEcrEtweAPoN? TheRE aRenO sEcrEts aMOnGthIS tEAm!
14183 : Eh? Oh, fine then.
14184 : This is an astral detection device designed by Chief Engineer Cid.
14185 : I don't really understand how it works exactly, but apparently it will help us zone in on the general location of Luzaf or the iron colossus.
14186 : We dO NoTrEquiRE aNysUCh ToY. YoU hAVeacCEsS tO tHELatESt tEChnoLOgYfROm wiNDurSt.
14187 : Toys? That's rich, coming from an overgrown spinning top.
14188 : HoW daREyOU adDReSstHE KiNg iNsUCh a mANneR!
14189 : Enough of this prattling. We are not here for fun and games. If preparations have been made, then I suggest we move out.
14190 : Wait up, %. I'm on strict orders from Captain Volker to stick by your side at all times!
14191 : PRoViSionALJaCk! Do nOT LEaVeyoUR KiNgbEHiNd!
14192 : Do I have your attention, %? I'll go over the mission again for your sake--I have the details memorized, of course.
14193 : The Endymion will touch down in the waters of the Sicklemoon Straits, and we'll travel north under the cover of darkness. Once we reach the coast of the Wajaom Woodlands, our ground team will disembark.
14194 : We then don our mercenary disguises and slip into Al Zahbi unnoticed and rendezvous with Rohin...Robin...
14195 : RoDin-CoMidiN! We reNDezVOuswiTH RoDin-CoMidiNin AhT UrHGaNwHiteGAte!
14196 : Ah yes, that was the name... Wait...how are you supposed to sneak in, King?

14200 : Ten degrees to starboard. What in the...?
14201 : Great Altana! That light!
14202 : Wha-! Aaargh!!!
14203 : Wh-what's going on out there!?
14204 : Hm...?
14205 : No tricks! Keep moving, slug!
14206 : The Age...of Judgment...is at hand...
14207 : The airship Endymion is being prepared for flight.
14208 : DEBUG: Press a button to continue.
14209 : I find it hard to believe that anyone could knock the Endymion out of the sky so easily. There must be some mistake...
14210 : The entire port is rushing to prepare the allied airship fleet to avenge the crew of the Endymion. We'll make those Imperial curs pay!
14211 : The alliance fleet has returned to Jeuno without firing a single shot in the name of the Endymion. Aht Urhgan has escaped a fiery fate...
14212 : Looking for someone, are we?
14213 : Gentleman by the name of [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji]? I'm afraid I'm not very good with names...
14214 : Lady by the name of [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde]? I'm afraid I'm not very good with names...
14215 : Gentleman by the name of [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant]? I'm afraid I'm not very good with names...
14216 : Lady by the name of [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue]? I'm afraid I'm not very good with names...
14217 : Gentleman by the name of [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga]? I'm afraid I'm not very good with names...
14218 : Lady by the name of [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa]? I'm afraid I'm not very good with names...
14219 : Lady by the name of [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka]? I'm afraid I'm not very good with names...
14220 : Gentleman by the name of [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof]? I'm afraid I'm not very good with names...
14221 : But my mother did always say that I had a gift for remembering size! Now, what can you tell me?
14222 : How tall is this person? Pretty tall. Around average. On the small side.
14223 : So this person is [pretty tall/around average/on the small side], eh? Yes. No, wait...
14224 : Hmmm... Can't say I've seen anyone like that around here. Perhaps you should try asking around somewhere besides the Ru'Lude Gardens.
14225 : It...it's you!
14226 : I've been searching far and wide for you, %. Rumor of your recent accomplishments has reached my ears.
14227 : Among other things, I know of your fated meeting with [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji], bearer of the Glass of All-Seeing.
14228 : Among other things, I know of your fated meeting with [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde], bearer of the Glass of All-Seeing.

14235 : Oh, Luto has already been so kind as to tell you about me? Then, this should make things a lot easier. So, what do you say? Will you lend a hand to my project?
14236 : Lend a hand? Certainly. Sorry...
14237 : Great! Your partner was equally enthusiastic about this. Please allow me to explain the details.
14238 : Is that so... That's a shame, because your partner was rather enthusiastic about this. Won't you spare just a moment to listen to my proposal?
14239 : You see, what I have envisioned is not an elongated epic tale of incredible feats. Rather, I would like to focus on telling a simple story about the everyday lives of two individuals who were predestined to meet.
14240 : So basically, to help me with my project, all I ask is for you to report to me the details of your daily activities together, no matter how insignificant they may be.
14241 : It may seem trivial, but this is the kind of information that allows writers to most faithfully and accurately portray their subject.
14242 : For instance, you could tell me about a trip you two embarked on to, say, Qufim Island, or how you thought that teamwork in battle was especially good on a particular day. Anything at all.
14243 : Whenever you've spent time with your partner, I would like you to come and report your undertakings to me, regardless of how unimportant the events seem to you.
14244 : Oh, please forgive me. I've left out a most important detail.
14245 : You're interested in knowing about compensation, am I correct?
14246 : With your cooperation, I have absolute confidence in being able to produce a masterpiece that will allow me to earn a name for myself as a writer.
14247 : When this has been achieved, I intend to reward you fittingly.
14248 : I realize that this is something that is yet to happen. I'm also fully aware of the fact that, until then, I am little more than the impoverished writer who stands before you.
14249 : I was grimly pondering on how I could compensate you for your assistance, when your partner suggested a most interesting solution.
14250 : What do you say to [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] and I rewarding you with items, based on your ongoing contribution to my project?
14251 : What do you say to [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] and I rewarding you with items, based on your ongoing contribution to my project?
14252 : What do you say to [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] and I rewarding you with items, based on your ongoing contribution to my project?

14254 : What do you say to [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] and I rewarding you with items, based on your ongoing contribution to my project?
14255 : What do you say to [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] and I rewarding you with items, based on your ongoing contribution to my project?
14256 : What do you say to [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] and I rewarding you with items, based on your ongoing contribution to my project?
14257 : What do you say to [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] and I rewarding you with items, based on your ongoing contribution to my project?
14258 : A payment in goods, to put it in crude terms. If none of the items are to your liking, your partner said that [he/she] would be happy to find alternatives.
14259 : What? You're curious as to why [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] is so cooperative towards my endeavor?
14260 : What? You're curious as to why [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde] is so cooperative towards my endeavor?
14261 : What? You're curious as to why [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant] is so cooperative towards my endeavor?
14262 : What? You're curious as to why [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue] is so cooperative towards my endeavor?
14263 : What? You're curious as to why [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga] is so cooperative towards my endeavor?
14264 : What? You're curious as to why [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa] is so cooperative towards my endeavor?
14265 : What? You're curious as to why [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka] is so cooperative towards my endeavor?
14266 : What? You're curious as to why [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof] is so cooperative towards my endeavor?
14267 : What can I say? [He/She] seems to have taken a special interest to my project.
14268 : Without a doubt, the most unique aspect of this project is its open-ended nature. Anything at all could happen. For instance, if you and [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji] were to become...

14276 : Uh, never mind that. There is no point in speculating on a story that has yet to unfold.
14277 : I will be waiting here whenever you have information to offer, or would like to collect your reward items.
14278 : You now have access to fellow points! The more time you spend with your fellow, the more it will accumulate.
14279 : The market is saturated with biographies of dauntless adventurers triumphing over the Shadow Lord, and even exaggerated accounts of encounters with the Twilight God himself. If I want to distinguish myself from the rest, I need to find a different angle, something fresh and unique...
14280 : Good day! Do you have any juicy morsels of information to offer me?
14281 : Hmmm...I see...most interesting. Let me jot this down...
14282 : Is there anything else I can do for you?
14283 : What would you like to do? Nothing. Spend my fellow points.
14284 : Nothing this time? I'll be waiting right here if you need me.
14285 : Spend fellow points on what? Nothing. Items for myself. Items for my fellow. Modifying my fellow.
14286 : Which item? (Your points: #). None. %(#). %(#). 10 %(#). 10 %(#). %(#). %(#). %(#).

14305 : Change equipment for which body part? Don't change. Torso. Arms. Legs. Feet.
14306 : Your fellow's equipment changes!
14307 : The maximum active time for your adventuring fellow increases!
14308 : You can now give more fashion advice to your adventuring fellow!
14309 : Change into what style Don't change. Heavy armor. Light armor. Mage gear. Freestyle.
14310 : You do not have sufficient fellow points.
14311 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
14312 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
14313 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
14314 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
14315 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
14316 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
14317 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
14318 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
14319 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
14320 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
14321 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
14322 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
14323 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
14324 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
14325 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
14326 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
14327 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
14328 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
14329 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
14330 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
14331 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
14332 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
14333 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!
14334 : Choose a location: West Ronfaure. East Ronfaure. La Theine Plateau. Valkurm Dunes. Jugner Forest. Batallia Downs. North Gustaberg. South Gustaberg. Konschtat Highlands. Pashhow Marshlands. Rolanberry Fields. Beaucedine Glacier. Xarcabard. West Sarutabaruta. East Sarutabaruta. Tahrongi Canyon. Buburimu Peninsula. Meriphataud Mountains. Sauromugue Champaign. Qufim Island. Behemoth's Dominion. Cape Teriggan. Eastern Altepa Desert. The Sanctuary of Zi'Tah. Ro'Maeve. Yuhtunga Jungle. Yhoator Jungle. Western Altepa Desert. Valley of Sorrows. Cancel.
14335 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there by %, kupo!
14336 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there, kupo!
14337 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
14338 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
14339 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
14340 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
14341 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
14342 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
14343 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
14344 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
14345 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
14346 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
14347 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
14348 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
14349 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
14350 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
14352 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
14353 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
14354 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
14355 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
14356 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
14357 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
14358 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
14359 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
14360 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
14361 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
14362 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

14388 : ...I see.
14389 : Needless to say, it is beyond my station to render a decision on affairs of state. Wait here. I will consult with my superiors.
14390 : It is as I expected. The Duchy will hold formal deliberations as to the potential repercussions of our involvement in this matter.
14391 : Chin up, %. The earnestness of the Empire's plea has not been lost on our diplomats. Perhaps the Silent Empire truly intends to change its ways...
14392 : I can offer no promises, but encourage you to do what you can in the meantime.
14393 : You make for the three nations from here, do you not? Then be on your way, and have faith that good tidings will await you upon your return.
14394 : Have you received consent from the three nations? Not yet, you say? Then I suggest you get moving.
14395 : The seals of the three nations...yes, everything seems to be in order. Good work.
14396 : You'll be pleased to know that the Duchy has also agreed to give its consent. Here are the relevant papers.
14397 : I trust you'll see that this matter ends well for all of us, %. Now you'd best be on your way.
14398 : You there. Yes, you, adventurer! Your downcast countenance tells me your life wants for exhilaration.
14399 : Who am I, you ask? Let's just say I'm he who is about to banish all trace of tedium from your life with an irresistible offer--one of otherworldly proportions, to be sure. For a mere # gil, this % I hold is yours.
14400 : But what in Slumbering Samwell's shank does it do, you ask? Consider yourself fortunate, for it's my policy to demystify before the customer buys.
14401 : What will you do? Let him ramble. Purchase %. Learn how to use it. Discard abyssite. Leave.
14402 : Ahem! Allow me to present you with a supposition.
14403 : Lying in parallel to the world upon which we stand exists another dimension.
14404 : Abyssea is its name--or at least, the name I've bestowed upon it. It is a world of boundless beauty, mystique, and riches unclaimed.
14405 : Now, suppose this % I hold is a key to accessing Abyssea. Were you in possession of one, your curiosity would get the better of you, yes?
14406 : Strictly speaking, this object does not grant entry into Abyssea itself.
14407 : It does, however, make it possible to interact with beings from that plane of existence--Abysseans, I call them.
14408 : The % serves to detect Abysseans that wander the gulf between worlds. How those hapless creatures--I refer to them as Voidwalkers--found their way there, mind you, is another subject entirely.
14409 : Having drifted to this realm from the world yonder, much like the Voidwalkers themselves, % are attuned to the presence of these creatures and will react--vibrate and emit light--when they draw near.
14410 : The closer your distance to a Voidwalker, the stronger the reaction becomes, until the creature is forcibly wrested into this dimension.
14411 : Repeated contact with Abysseans will cause the % to take on different hues, allowing it to respond to creatures belonging to the higher echelons of Voidwalkers.
14412 : Be forewarned! Abysseans are among the most foul-tempered, unpredictable creatures. You would do well to steel yourself for a trying encounter prior to making contact.
14413 : I trust your many adventures have made you familiar with those ghastly statues scattered across the land called cavernous maws.
14414 : My observations have revealed that the concentration of Voidwalkers is greatest in locations where these statues are found.
14415 : As yet, I have no plausible explanations for this phenomenon, but you needn't concern yourself with such details.
14416 : Yours, my friend, is a dilemma infinitely simpler in nature.
14417 : All this far-fetched talk of Abyssea, Abysseans, and Voidwalkers...
14418 : I'm fully aware of the fantastical nature of my tale, and do not think poorly of those inclined to skepticism.
14419 : Yet I feel no need to vouch further for the authenticity of my claims. Such is my confidence that the truth speaks for itself.
14420 : Now then. A great new world has presented itself before you. The question is, will you embrace this opportunity, or let it pass you by?
14421 : As Abysseans cross from one realm to another, so too does gil pass from one individual to the next. In my mind, it is only fitting that gil is that which grants you the key to Abyssea.
14422 : My tales have piqued your interest, have they? As I have mentioned prior, the price is # gil.
14423 : Hand over # gil? Aye. Nay.
14424 : No? The sum I ask is by no means prohibitive. I'll be waiting here, should you ever change your mind.
14425 : I thank you for your custom. Here is your very own %!
14426 : As a service for all customers, upon request I will take your % off your hands and dispose of it in your stead.
14427 : The ability to meddle with inter-dimensional matter can be considered a great power, with which comes great responsibility. Indeed there have been those who found the burden beyond their capacity to cope.
14428 : It seems you are short on gil. Yet I cannot grant concessions, lest access to otherworldly realms lose its true value.
14429 : I see you've developed a taste for %. Yet I fear I cannot furnish you further, for one alone is sufficient to invite misfortune upon the heedless.
14430 : You wish to know how to use the %? There is no trick to it. Allow me to demonstrate.
14431 : While in possession of %, simply assume a resting pose. I'm given to understand it is second nature to all adventurers.
14432 : Doing so will cause your % to react. Pertinent information can be gleaned by observing the magnitude of its vibration and the manner of light emitted.
14433 : Should neither reaction occur, take it to mean that no Voidwalkers roam the area.
14434 : Should it vibrate softly but emit no light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers have recently passed through and may soon return.
14435 : Should it vibrate softly and emit a gentle light, take it to mean that Voidwalkers presently roam the area.
14436 : Now, pay particular attention to what I'm about to explain. The reaction of the % will change once a predetermined distance from a Voidwalker has been closed.
14437 : From that point onwards, the magnitude of the vibration corresponds directly to the creature's strength. Based on this knowledge, it is your decision whether to pursue it further.
14438 : The gentle glow of light, on the other hand, will intensify to become a radiant beam pointing in the direction of the creature.
14439 : Following that beam to its end will cause the heretofore invisible Voidwalker to cross fully over into this world and take form.
14440 : This precise moment of encounter with an Abyssean, I have dubbed contact.
14441 : Not only are Abysseans known to be temperamental and unpredictable; there are those that demonstrate a degree of cunning and guile far beyond that seen in this world.
14442 : Consider yourself warned.
14443 : For as surely as the beam of light emitted by the % guides you to a Voidwalker, so too does it guide the Voidwalker to you. Be ever mindful of this fact.
14444 : Know also that not one, but numerous Voidwalkers may roam the land at any given time, and the readings indicate only the creature nearest you.
14445 : You would do well to check the readings regularly, as a sudden change in the light's direction could mean a different Voidwalker has wandered your way.
14446 : Voidwalkers will only reveal their true form at the point of contact, and seeking one only to be met with another is a scenario all adventurers want to avoid.
14447 : But surely, you grow weary of my ramblings. I for one believe this is something best learned through doing.
14448 : Has the burden of this responsibility proven too heavy to bear? Very well, I will take it off your hands and see to its disposal.
14449 : Discard which one? % % % % % % % % % % None of them.
14450 : Are you certain? Aye. Nay.
14451 : It is done. You needn't concern yourself with unseen foes any longer. A tame, tranquil adventuring life bereft of exhilaration will be yours once more.
14452 : Forgive me. My personal thirst for the unknown has no bearing on the decisions of others. I will be here, however, should you have a change of heart.
14453 : # gil paid. Obtained key item: %!
14454 : You relinquish the %.
14455 : Kupo-ho! Another adventurer has found [his/her] way to my domain. Was it my aura of superior sagacity that led you here? This conspicuous crate and chest that sit seductively at my side?
14456 : Many secrets have I to tell, but sadly, they would be beyond your meager mental faculties to fathom. Return when your abilities are up to the task.
14457 : It is no matter. What matters is that you are here, and from the look of it, you are a suitable subject for the task I would entrust to you.
14458 : I speak to you on behalf of the Magian Mooglehood, an ancient and august assembly of wisemoogles hailing from the once-glorious Kingdom of Kupalika.
14459 : Our predecessors were councilors and confidants to none other than the celebrated King Kupofried himself. To this day, it is our mission to safeguard the secrets of their moogle magic and see them properly passed down to posterity.
14460 : Each illustrious member of the Magian Mooglehood guards knowledge of a distinct branch of our lineal lore. My specialty lies in weaponry; with my aid, you will be doling out damage and destruction in ways heretofore unimagined!
14461 : What impelled you to impart this long-withheld wisdom to us? And why now, kupo? the unenlightened adventurer might ask.
14462 : To which the wise moogle would readily reply: The answer, my friend, is in the mog tablets--those remarkable relics wrought by King Kupofried himself--that were only recently recovered by resourceful adventurers such as rrr...yourself.
14463 : There is an ancient (and somewhat alarming) prophecy in our mooglehood. It goes...<ahem>...King Kupofried's creations shall slumber soundly until such time as their Super Kupowers are called upon to save the realm from utter ruin, kupo.
14464 : The particulars of the prophecy--preposterous as this may seem--outstrip even our prodigious powers of perception.
14465 : Yet this I know, kupo: if moogle magic is what shall deliver this world from destruction, then moogle magic this world shall have--in abundance!
14466 : As an adventurer of renown, repute, and paramount prowess, you would seem a worthy beneficiary for our boon. And yet the Magian Mooglehood is nothing if not meticulously methodical. No, we must be certain...
14467 : I propose to task you with a series of trials. Each time you emerge victorious, we shall proffer you a portion of our powers, kupo.
14468 : What say you, adventurer? Will you undertake the Trial of the Magians, that you might one day wield the mightiest of moogle magic to save your realm from destruction and devastation?
14469 : Tackle the Trial of the Magians, kupo? Will I ever! Maybe another time...
14470 : Excellent. Then my first gift unto you shall be this: a journal that shall serve to record all of your extraordinary exploits.
14471 : We understand, for with great kupower comes great responsibility. Should you ever be willing to bear the burden, we shall welcome your return.
14472 : You, who would inherit the mysteries of the magians...speak unto me your wish, kupo.
14473 : Choose your action: Review current trial. Abandon current trial. List available trials. Ask for aid. Ask about roaming trial log. Move on.
14474 : [Review/Abandon] which trial? Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Return.
14475 : You are not currently undertaking any trials.
14476 : Target item (pre-augmentation): %.
14477 : Target item (post-augmentation): %.
14478 : Press onward with this trial? Persevere. Retire.
14479 : Abandon this trial, and all records of your efforts thus far will be lost forever. I encourage due deliberation before making your decision.
14480 : Truly abandon the trial, kupo? Persevere. Retire.
14481 : Very well, kupo. I shall remove all records of this trial from your %.
14482 : You have abandoned Trial #.
14483 : Remember that before you can undertake a new trial, your target item must be purged of its trial insignia.
14484 : Trade the item to me, and I shall see it returned to its pristine original state, kupo.
14485 : You are not currently undertaking that trial.
14486 : Kupo-ho. This item bears the insignia of a trial already abandoned.
14487 : It is but a superfluous scribble now. Shall I erase it for you, kupo?
14488 : Erase the abandoned trial insignia? Yes, remove it. No, leave it.
14489 : Kupo...ho? My moogle magic seems to have misfired. Perhaps we should try that again.
14490 : The trial insignia has vanished from your %.
14491 : Select a category: Hand-to-Hand. Daggers. Swords. Great Swords. Axes. Great Axes. Scythes. Polearms. Katana. Great Katana. Clubs. Staves. Archery. Marksmanship. Instruments. Search by trial number. Cancel.
14492 : Kupo-ho...ho? I know of no such trial. And given the immense nature of my intellect, that means it could not possibly exist.
14493 : What would you know, kupo? About the trials. Undertaking a trial. Completing a trial. Return.
14494 : Did I not regale you with the tale of the magians only a short while ago? Well, not all can be possessed of moogle-class powers of memory...
14495 : As I have already apprised you, the ancient moogle art of weapon augmentation is my specialty, kupo.
14496 : First, you must retrieve a weapon from the chest beside me. Show it to me, and I will reveal to you the trials you may undertake to receive my boon.
14497 : The % I entrusted to you will record your exploits for up to ten trials at any given time, kupo.
14498 : Be aware that certain extraordinary weapons entail exclusive trials. Such details and more may be confirmed by requesting of me a list of available trials.
14499 : Should you successfully complete an assigned trial, return and present your target weapon to me to substantiate your success.
14500 : If I deem that you have completed my challenge in good order, you shall receive your reward right then and there, kupo!
14501 : Now, this is important enough that I shall say it twice, even thrice: at the end of your trial, you must trade to me the very same weapon you submitted at the start.
14502 : Lose this weapon and all your hard-won successes will be for naught. You must avoid such a grievous gaffe at all costs, kupo.
14503 : Very well. Show me the target weapon for the trial of which you speak, kupo.
14504 : Kupo-ho! Is that % I see? Why, yes... I could fashion a fitting trial or two for you, kupo.
14505 : Are you absolutely, positively sure that you want to undertake Trial #, kupo?
14506 : Undertake Trial #? I am ready. Perhaps another time.
14507 : Excellent, kupo! Now, to invoke a simple incantation, and...
14508 : Your % is now recording the progress of your trials!
14509 : Through the marvel of moogle magic, your exploits will be recorded without you having to so much as lift a quill! And just in case you're the forgetful type...
14510 : A trial insignia has been inscribed upon your %!
14511 : Note: You may not undertake a different trial with an already-inscribed weapon.
14512 : Kupo-oh? Might your mind be muddled, my friend? You're already attempting that trial.
14513 : Kupo... I fear this item is ill-suited for the trial you wish to undertake.
14514 : Why, every page in your % is full!
14515 : You must complete or abandon one of your current trials before undertaking another, kupo.
14516 : Kupo...oh? It would seem I have no trials pertaining to that particular piece of weaponry.
14517 : As I advised you previously, my sole specialty is weapons. I have not the moogle magic at my disposal to augment items of this variety, kupo...
14518 : You are already undertaking Trial # with that %.
14519 : You have done well, kupo.
14520 : The Magian Mooglehood recognizes your feats, and proffers you now a portion of our ancestral powers.
14521 : Ready yourself to receive our boon...
14522 : There is a sudden flash of light as potent moogle magic surges through the %!
14523 : The deed is done, kupo.
14524 : Know, adventurer, that the % you now hold is no mere earthly arm. Nay, it is an empyrean weapon--an artifact birthed of the heavens, possessed of such power as to transcend even time and space.
14525 : Supreme strength, lost for ages to even the most hallowed heroes of your world, now lies at your disposal. Use it well, kupo.
14526 : With great kupower comes great responsibility. Wield our gift wisely, that the world may be saved and King Kupofried's noble aims brought to fruition!

14532 : Here is all you need to know about Trial #, kupo.
14533 : You will need this item to begin the trial, kupo.
14534 : You will be rewarded with this item upon your triumphant return, kupo!
14535 : # # # # # # # #
14536 : You must dispose of the % in your possession before I can confer upon you another one.
14537 : The Magian Moogle returns your %.
14538 : Warning: Completing this trial will result in an increase in the level requirement for the target item.
14539 : Ah, so you wish to review your % whilst adventuring, do you? A most reasonable request, kupo.
14540 : Sadly, Magian Mooglehood protocol dictates that all trial progress be recorded in archaic moogleglyphs that are, I fear, illegible to your unenlightened eye.
14541 : That is where this % comes into play. Outfitted with this marvel of moogle technology, why, even the most slow-witted snoll could decipher moogleglyphs as effortlessly as if he were King Kupofried himself!
14542 : What's more, its owner will also gain access to the Moogle's Almanack. With the secrets of weather prognostication contained therein, you'll never be a victim to capricious changes in the elements again!
14543 : For only a small donation of # gil, it is yours. All proceeds go toward the Kupalikan United Preservationsists Overseeing History and Orthography (KUPOHO)--a commendable cause, I'm sure you'll agree.
14544 : Donate # gil, kupo? Donate. Not today.
14545 : Ah well. Perhaps another time, kupo.

14559 : Obtain %? Take it. Leave it.
14560 : Fie! Yet another dolled-up young'un wearing a doltish grin!
14561 : Kids these days only seem to be interested in what's on the outside, and don't have a glance to spare for what's on the inside. Things weren't like that back in my day, no siree!
14562 : If you've got the time to be trimming eyebrows, why don't you use it for something worthwhile...like sending letters? Which reminds me, I was supposed to send one to the moogles, but I completely forgot.
14563 : I blame this absent-mindedness not on lack of training, but old age. That's one excuse you won't be able to exploit for some years yet, whippersnapper.
14564 : But that's enough rambling for this old man. Here, take this with you and run along now.
14565 : Not a while ago a San d'Orian boy--Halver, I think his name was--came through here. I wonder what business he had at the Duchy...
14566 : Happy 9th Vana'versary, kupo! I've received a proper profusion of congratulatory letters from all over the land!
14567 : Now, knowing how you adventurers are busier than breadwinner bees, I've chosen only the choicest missive to recite. Here goes! Ahem!
14568 : Esteemed adventurers of Vana'diel,   In the wake of your passage blows the wind of peace and prosperity. In the sparkling of your eyes we behold a future bright and fair.
14569 : On behalf of all Jeuno, I extend to you my heartfelt gratitude. The Duchy is ever indebted to you, her gates ever open to you. Now and for all time.
14570 : Archduke Kam'lanaut
14571 : How's about that, eh? Such a high heaping of praise from Jeuno's head honcho himself is a right rarity, kupo! Why, I was nigh swept off my wings when I first read the letter!
14572 : Oho! Your evidently expectant expression tells me you know what's coming next!
14573 : Tada! Deck yourself in these dandy duds and set free your festive frame of mind, kupopo!
14574 : Kupo-whoa! Looking decidedly [debonair/dazzling] there, kupo!
14575 : That reminds me, we're running low on materials needed to make the garments. Deliveries of custom-made fabric, leather, and metal trimmings haven't arrived in quite some time, kupo.
14576 : What could possibly be causing the delay? I'd go and see for myself, but for my permanent posting here, kupo...
14577 : Hm? Why aren't you sporting your %? You can't just amble about in awkwardly arranged attire, kupo!
14578 : Hey, why aren't you clothed congruously with the celebration, kupo?
14579 : What? Don't have %, you say?
14580 : I can't allow you to amble about in awkwardly arranged attire, kupo! Here, quickly slip this on before you become the laughingstock of mooglekind!
14581 : What? You have neither % nor %, kupo!? We barely have enough to hand out, yet you go misplacing yours! Utterly unbelievable!
14582 : <Sigh>... Listen, kupo. I like you, so I'm going to issue you a replacement set. Just don't go blabbing to your buddies about the boon, all right?
14583 : Hmmm... We're still short on % and %, kupo.
14584 : Hmmm... We're still short on %, kupo.
14585 : Kupopo!? You've obtained the overdue objects for me, you say!?
14586 : Oh, deliriously delightful day! Without ado, pray present the procured pieces to me!
14587 : % hands the materials to the excited moogle.
14588 : Wonderful! I can fairly find no fault with the items, kupo!
14589 : You have done us moogles a great service! Truly, you are deserving of the noble (and non-existent) Adventurer of the Anniversary Award, kupo!
14590 : Please accept this as a tiny token of my gargantuan gratitude.
14591 : The Adventurer Appreciation Campaign will run for a limited time only. Be sure to make the most of it while it lasts, kupo!
14592 : I demand that you take this % off my hands.
14593 : Sorry, but you can't hold any more than # %.
14594 : Sorry, but I'm not authorized to give you any more % right now. Ask me again in # [minute/minutes].
14595 : Hey, otsukare. You don't have a %. Nande, you shouldn't be talking to me.
14596 : My name is Blue, but people call me Blu. FYI, I'm a member of the MM. That's the Magian Mooglehood. Shiranai no?
14597 : Otsukare. Ya wanna do something?
14598 : Ya wanna do something? Review current trial. Abandon current trial. List available trials. Ask for aid. Move on.
14599 : [Review/Abandon] which trial? Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Trial #. Return.
14600 : You have no current trials in progress.
14601 : Target item (pre-augmentation): %.
14602 : Target item (post-augmentation): %.
14603 : You wanna keep going? Keep going. Give up.
14604 : Yameru no? You wanna quit? Soshitara, I'm gonna have to erase all your trial progress. You okay with that, kupo?
14605 : Abandon the trial? Persevere. Retire.
14606 : If you say so. Sore ja, hand me your % and I'll clear it for you.
14607 : You have abandoned Trial #.
14608 : Uh, maybe I have no clue what I'm doing, but I don't see an item for that trial. If you have it somewhere, you gotta give it to me so I can clear it.
14609 : Sou shinai to, you won't be able to start another trial until you do. That's like, basic etiquette of Magian trials, so...yoroshiku.
14610 : You do not currently have that trial in progress.
14611 : Uh, yeah. This item's still got a trial mark on it.
14612 : Erase shite ii no? Ya want me to wipe it clean?
14613 : Erase the abandoned trial insignia? Yes, remove it. No, leave it.
14614 : Uh, gomen... I'm a little busy right now. Can you come back later?
14615 : The trial insignia has vanished from your %.
14616 : Select a category: Head. Body. Hands. Legs. Feet. Shields. Search by trial number. Cancel.
14617 : Uh, I've never heard of that trial. You'll have to ask my assistant. What? I don't have one? Maji de?
14618 : Yeah? About the trials. Undertaking a trial. Completing a trial. Has anyone told you that you talk funny? Return.
14619 : You want to know about trials? Okay, let me tell you. So, like, I have trials. Sore de, I give them to you. Soshitara, some stuff happens, and...yeah. ...Uh, actually, you should probably ask the other guy.
14620 : Okay. So like, first, you give me an item that goes with a trial.
14621 : Soshitara, I tell you which trials you can choose. Your % can record up to ten trials at once. Wakatta? Got it?
14622 : If you wanna know what items go with which trials, uh, don't ask me, 'cause I have no idea. Demo, you can check the list of trials yourself.
14623 : If you finish your objectives, you can trade the trial item back to me. Umaku ikeba, I'll actually remember which trial goes with it.
14624 : Soko de, I'll confirm to see if you've completed your objectives. If you're good, we start the ceremony.
14625 : Dakedo, you don't wanna lose your trial item. That would be really, really...bad.
14626 : One time I lost my trial item, and I didn't even notice until, like, three weeks later when someone asked me Hey, where's your trial item?, and I was like all, yacchimatta, I lost it!
14627 : Huh, maji de? No one's ever told me that before.
14628 : Maa, I might seem chotto weird to you, but I still have the skills to upgrade your armor. So hey, don't miss your chance to blow, this kikai comes only once in a jinsei, yo.
14629 : A trial for %? Chotto matte yo, just one second...
14630 : Maybe you wanna do Trial #?
14631 : Take on Trial #? Sure! Nah.
14632 : Ryokai, understood. De wa, let's begin.
14633 : Your % is now recording the progress of your trial!
14634 : Sou da, I almost forgot this.
14635 : A trial insignia has been inscribed upon your %!
14636 : Note: While your item is inscribed with this insignia, you may not undertake any other trials with the same item.
14637 : Uh, I think you're already doing that trial? Atama daijoubu?
14638 : I can't give you a trial for that item right now. Don't ask me why, because, uh, I don't really know.
14639 : Uh, there's no space to write in your %.
14640 : Tsumari, you have to finish or cancel one of your current trials before taking on a new one.
14641 : Uh, I don't think there are any trials for that item.
14642 : Uh, sorry, I'm only in charge of armor. Nande, for that item, you'll have to talk to the other dude.
14643 : Yo. You're already doing Trial # for that %. You can't do more than one trial for the same item. That's just not the way it's done.
14644 : It looks like you finished your objectives. Omedetou! Sugoi, that % is totally bursting with power.
14645 : Uh, what do I do now again? Ah, omoidashita! I remember now!
14646 : Jaaa, yoroshiku!!!
14647 : There is a sudden flash of light as potent moogle magic surges through the %!
14648 : Uh, yeah, this thing is pretty powerful. You'll want to take good care of it. Daiji ni shite yo.
14649 : Jaa, Vana'diel o yoroshiku! We're counting on you!

14658 : Uh, you've already got %. Dakara, you'll have to get rid of it before you get another.
14659 : Hullo there! You can call me Green, the newest member of the Magian Mooglehood! I might still be wet behind the wings, but just you wait! Someday I'll be as powerful and pretentious as my elders, kupo!
14660 : Though from the looks of it, you're even more of a greenhorn than myself. Come back when you've got a bit more experience under your belt, will you? I'm rooting for you, kupo!
14661 : Kupo-ho! You look like you're pretty proficient at that profession of yours. Why don't I let you in on a little secret?
14662 : With just a modicum of guidance, you can acquire some special equipment to show the world, leaving folk oohing and aahing in the process!
14663 : Doesn't that sound like fun? Care to give it a go, kupo?
14664 : Give it a go, kupo? Yeah! Nah.
14665 : Splendid answer! Your spirit of self-improvement rather reminds me of myself, kupo! Here, take this %.
14666 : You can use this until you're ready to receive a full-fledged % from Elder Orange over there.
14667 : Oh, and don't worry, kupo. At that time, your trial records will be transferred automatically from the old log to the new. Let it never be said that the Magian Mooglehood doesn't take care of its vict--er, challengers.
14668 : Kupo-whoa! Is that % you have there, or are you just happy to see me? I guess we won't be needing this %, then...
14669 : Now, you'll want to make sure that you have room in your gobbiebag before taking on a trial. Go ahead, kupo! I won't be going anywhere.
14670 : Whenever you're ready to take on a trial, you know where to find me, kupo!
14671 : Need something, kupo?
14672 : What will you do? Take on a trial. Review current trial. Abandon current trial. List available trials. Ask for aid. Move on.
14673 : [Take on/Review] which trial? None. Warrior. Monk. White Mage. Black Mage. Red Mage. Thief. Paladin. Dark Knight. Beastmaster. Bard. Ranger. Samurai. Ninja. Dragoon. Summoner. Blue Mage. Corsair. Puppetmaster. Dancer. Scholar.

14678 : Continue with this trial? Press on. Give up.
14679 : Giving up so soon? You'll never make a name for yourself that way, kupo. Are you sure?
14680 : Abandon the trial? Persevere. Retire.
14681 : Well, that's a shame. And I had such high hopes for you, kupo. Oh well, I'll just have to wipe your % clean.
14682 : You have abandoned Trial #.
14683 : Kupo-oh? I was going to erase the trial insignia from your item, but I don't see it anywhere.
14684 : You can't start a new trial until you clear the mark from the old one. Sorry, but rules are rules, kupo. So when you find the item, just trade it to me, okay?
14685 : You do not currently have that trial in progress.
14686 : Kupo-oh? This item is still marked for a trial you've abandoned.
14687 : Want me to erase it so you can make a fresh start? I would highly recommend that you do, kupo.
14688 : Erase the abandoned trial insignia? Yes, remove it. No, leave it.
14689 : What am I supposed to be doing again? Please forgive me. I'm still new around here, kupo.
14690 : The trial insignia has vanished from your %.
14691 : Kupo? I've never heard of that trial. Are my elders telling you secrets that they're not telling me, kupo?
14692 : Ask something? About this training... Undertaking a trial. Completing a trial. Return.
14693 : Ooh, ooh! Do I get to explain about trials? I've studied so, uh...studiously...for this day, kupo! <Ahem>... The Magian Mooglehood is an ancient and august assembly of, er, moogles...who, uh, do super-secret special things, and...and...
14694 : So, yeah! You can talk to Elder Orange when you've reached a certain level of experience, and he'll send you on all sorts of sadistic--er, challenging--trials. Complete them, and you can receive all kinds of nifty items and stuff.
14695 : But what's even more exciting is the set of stupendously stylish job-specific poses that I can teach you, kupo!
14696 : Learn one, and you'll be able to use it even if you engage in a temporary career change. Why, it's the perfect way to share your profound passion for your chosen profession with the world!
14697 : So here's the deal. In order to learn a gesture from me, you'll first need to achieve a certain level of proficiency in your chosen job. In the perplexing parlance of the Magian Mooglehood, we call that level 30.
14698 : Choose one of the trials, and I'll give you a piece of equipment, kupo. You don't need to wear it, but keep it close by until you complete your task.
14699 : If you ever want to take a peek at your progress, just come back to me. ...Or if you change your mind and decide to quit. But that's no fun, kupo!
14700 : Any items requested of you in your trials can be tossed into that handy-dandy delivery crate sitting beside Elder Orange, kupo.
14701 : Once you've completed your objective, return here and trade back to me the piece of equipment I gave you at the start of your trial. Just like that, your work is done! Huzzah!
14702 : So make especially sure that you don't lose the equipment, of course. If you do, how will I know your deed is done, kupo?
14703 : I truly can't emphasize it enough: take extra-special care of the item I give you until your trial is through! Are we clear, kupo?
14704 : Complete one of my trials, and I'll teach you the corresponding gesture. My elders say that this knowledge will be imprinted in your memory as a key item, a term that is completely inscrutable to an initiate like me, kupo.
14705 : They also say that to strike the pose, you need only chant the ancient moogle incantation /jobemote (job name). Why, my tongue got all tied just trying to pronounce that, kupo!
14706 : A trial for %? Well, let's just see here, kupo...
14707 : I've got it! How about Trial #?
14708 : Take on Trial #? Sure! Nah.
14709 : Wonderful! Let me just moogle-magic that up for you, kupo!
14710 : Your % is now recording the progress of your trial!
14711 : Oh, and that's right! I need to engrave up your equipment as well, don't I?
14712 : A trial insignia has been inscribed upon your %!
14713 : Note: While your item is inscribed with this insignia, you may not undertake any other trials with the same item.
14714 : It looks like you're already working on that trial, kupo. It's okay. I'm still getting the hang of this, too!
14715 : Oh, I'm so terribly sorry! I don't think I can assign that trial to you yet. I'd tell you why, but the elders won't even let me know, kupo!
14716 : Wow! That's a full % if I've ever seen one, kupo. Sorry, but the rules say you can only undertake a maximum of ten trials at once.
14717 : You'll have to complete or abandon one of your current trials before starting a new one. Someday, when I'm in charge of the mooglehood, I'll change this silly rule! Might be a while, though, kupo...
14718 : Kupo-oh-oh. I'm afraid there aren't any trials for that item.
14719 : Hmm. I've never heard of any trials for that item.  Maybe the elders just didn't tell me about them, kupo?
14720 : You're already working on a trial for that %, kupo. Trial #, to be exact.
14721 : Well, look who's managed to complete their trial! That % is just boiling to the brim with moogle magic!
14722 : I certainly hope I remember the incantation the elders taught me.
14723 : Kupolius...augmentus!
14724 : There is a sudden flash of light as potent moogle magic surges through the %!
14725 : A burst of energy shoots from the % into your body, and you suddenly feel more stylish than before!
14726 : % is imprinted into your memory!
14727 : Well, this was perfect practice for both of us, wouldn't you say? Come back any time you're ready for another trial, kupo!
14728 : Ta-ta, kupo!

14736 : You'll need to start off with this item:
14737 : And you'll get this one as a reward:
14738 : Oh. You can't hold more than one %, so you'll want to take care of the one you have before you come back. I'm new, but even I know that, kupo!
14739 : Capacity-challenged adventurers, come one, come all, kupo! The Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has developed the supreme solution for your storage woes!
14740 : Ah, another adventurer has arrived to take advantage of world-renowned moogle altruism and artisanship! Rest assured that you will not depart disappointed, my friend.
14741 : Feast your eyes on the stylish, fashionable Mog Sack!
14742 : Why, it's the perfect union of form and function! Who could ask for more, kupo?
14743 : What's more, its carrying capacity can be customized to meet its owner's needs. Greedaloxes and Grand Greedaloxes haven't seen anything like this!
14744 : And it can be yours--yes, yours!--for the low, low price of only # gil! Why, that's # gil off the moogle manufacturer's suggested retail price.
14745 : That's right, we at the MHMU don't care how far into debt we go this time! Why, I personally would starve to death in the streets of San d'Oria to free adventurers the world over from inventory frustration! So how about it, kupo?
14746 : Kupo? (Current gil: #) Buy a mog sack. (# gil) Expand your mog sack. About mog sacks. About expansion. Do nothing.
14747 : I'm sorry, kupo. Our special-order mog sacks are limited to one per adventurer.
14748 : Transaction complete, kupo! Say goodbye to days of rummaging through your gobbiebag, and hello to a life of haute hupoture, because you are now the proud owner of a spectacular, snazzy, state-of-the-art mog sack!
14749 : We go through such pains for you adventurers, and you would try to procure our products without sufficient funds, kupo? Will you not be content until every last moogle is in the poorhouse!? <Sniff>...<sob>...
14750 : Oh dear! I almost forgot the most important part, kupo!
14751 : Looking to expand your mog sack? You've come to the right place, kupo!
14752 : A little dose of moogle magic, and...voila, kupo! Your mog sack can now hold an incredible [/35/40/45/50/55/60/65/70/75/80] items!
14753 : You hear the disconcerting sound of fabric being stretched to its limits...
14754 : There you go, kupo! And with that, it looks like I've enlarged your mog sack as far as it will go.
14755 : A ripping sound? I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about, kupo. My, oh my, that's one stupendous mog sack you've got there!
14756 : I'm afraid your mog sack has already been enlarged to its limits. We wouldn't want to have any...fabric malfunctions, would we, kupo?
14757 : I'm afraid your mog sack has reached its limits. Your gobbiebag, on the other hand, looks like it could still be tailored up in the right hands.
14758 : The mog sack is a marvel of modern moogle craftsmanship, imbued with moogle magic that allows its capacity to be increased proportional to the size of your gobbiebag!
14759 : How does that work, you ask? Let's just call it a moogle and Gobbie mystery! Kupohohoho!
14760 : Ah, yes. And for being such a valued customer, here's a special present from the MHMU to you! Truly, our benevolence knows no bounds, kupo!
14761 : Sack storage space: # Gobbiebag storage space: expanded to [30/35/40/45/50/55/60/65/70/75/80] .
14762 : Processing: #
14763 : Kupo-ho-ho? Is that % I see?
14764 : In that case, my infallible instincts tell me you possess a partner who will be paying a visit to this venue at any moment now...
14765 : %. Here you are.
14766 : %! Phew, I'm glad I caught up with you!
14767 : Ah, %. I thought I might find you here.
14768 : Ever the elusive type, aren't you, %?
14769 : There you are, %! I thought I'd never find you!
14770 : Tsk, tsk, %... Playing hard to get, are we?
14771 : Ah, %! I've been looking all over for you.
14772 : %! Found you at last!
14773 : %. I thought I might come across you here.
14774 : Peekaboo! I found you, %!
14775 : %. I'm relieved to find you at last.
14776 : %. You've quite some nerve, making me hunt you down like this.
14777 : ...Right on cue, kupo. Truly, I never cease to amaze myself.
14778 : [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji], was it?
14779 : [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde], was it?
14780 : [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant], was it?
14781 : [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue], was it?
14782 : [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga], was it?
14783 : [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa], was it?
14784 : [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka], was it?
14785 : [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof], was it?
14786 : I have been apprised of your crisis of confidence from a certain mesmerizing Mithran lass, kupo. Said something must be done about this sorry state of affairs, kupo.
14787 : ...Luto. Hmph. She should mind her own business.
14788 : Mesmerizing! Who would have thought that moogles and Mithra-- Wait a minute, who are you calling sorry!?
14789 : Ah, Luto. Methinks the lass worries too much.
14790 : ...Indeed. Ever the observant one, that Luto.
14791 : Crisis? No crisis here! Nuh-uh! I'm as calm and collected as ever! Right, %? Right?
14792 : Whoa there! Just hold your chocobos, Mister Moogle! I've got a reputation to uphold here.
14793 : What? Why, I never...!
14794 : Hey, be a little more gentle with a lady, will ya? Still, it's sweet of Luto to be looking after me.
14795 : I suppose there was no hiding it. Though Luto could be a bit more gentle with her choice of words...
14796 : Aw, gee...was it that obvious? Tee hee hee!
14797 : ... That I struggle is true, but I think Luto overstates matters.
14798 : Hm. I am not surprised. I always figured that Luto for a sharp one.
14799 : <Ahem>... Yes, yes. At any rate, the plight you suffer is not atypical of adventurers like yourself, kupo.
14800 : Fortunately, I have crafted a challenge that should serve you well in your struggle to transcend your physical limits. % here has already reaped the fruits of my ingenuity. Is that not right, %?
14801 : Yes, this sensible and not-in-the-least-sadistic trial will see you to your goal with only the minimum required quota of charred skin and broken bones. This I vouch on the honor of the Magian Mooglehood, kupo.
14802 : Now listen closely, as I do not have all day.
14803 : Long and hard did I ponder on a suitable task for partners such as the two of you.  And I have found the answer...
14804 : A trial in tandem! Two hearts beating as one! You will cut through reams of foes in sublime synchronicity, with not a single step, not a single breath out of rhythm...or else!
14805 : ...Ahem, kupo.
14806 : Pardon me. It would seem I got carried away with myself for a moment there.
14807 : You need not synchronize your actions to such an extreme. Simply partnering up to perform a simple trial shall suffice.
14808 : A trial in tandem, the moogle says...
14809 : A trial in tandem! This sounds like a challenge that we're ready to meet, %!
14810 : A trial in tandem, eh? I daresay this might prove entertaining.
14811 : A trial in tandem...? I suspect this will not prove as simple as our moogle friend suggests.
14812 : A trial in tandem? I don't know, but the way this moogle talks gives me the heebie-jeebies.
14813 : A trial in tandem? I should hope it's as simple as the moogle says. I don't want to get any scratches on my perfectly polished armor.
14814 : A trial in tandem? Has a nice ring to it, I must say.
14815 : A trial in tandem? Sounds like we've got a rousing adventure in store for us, %!
14816 : A trial in tandem, hm? It sounds like a daunting task, but I shall give it my all.
14817 : Tandem? This moogle sure uses a lot of fancy words! But hey, I'll be just fine as long as I'm with you, %!
14818 : A trial in tandem? I care not for the whimsical name, but I look forward to facing it with you, %.
14819 : A trial in tandem, hm? I can only hope the challenge lives up to its name.
14820 : At any rate, hand this over to Brother Blue to commence your challenge. Now take your leave of me, kupo.
14821 : Sore ja, so...I don't know what to do with that, but a Mithra named Luto should be in the loop. That's just the standard workflow, yo.
14822 : % and [Feliz/Ferdinand/Gunnar/Massimo/Oldrich/Siegward/Theobald/Zenji], was it? You have done well to return. The time for your next trial is at hand, kupo.
14823 : % and [Amerita/Beatrice/Henrietta/Jesimae/Karyn/Nanako/Sharlene/Sieghilde], was it? You have done well to return. The time for your next trial is at hand, kupo.
14824 : % and [Chanandit/Deulmaeux/Demresinaux/Ephealgaux/Gauldeval/Grauffemart/Migaifongut/Romidiant], was it? You have done well to return. The time for your next trial is at hand, kupo.
14825 : % and [Armittie/Cadepure/Clearite/Epilleve/Liabelle/Nauthima/Radille/Vimechue], was it? You have done well to return. The time for your next trial is at hand, kupo.
14826 : % and [Balu-Falu/Burg-Ladarg/Ehgo-Ryuhgo/Kolui-Pelui/Nokum-Akkum/Savul-Kivul/Vinja-Kanja/Yarga-Umiga], was it? You have done well to return. The time for your next trial is at hand, kupo.
14827 : % and [Cupapa/Jajuju/Kalokoko/Mahoyaya/Pakurara/Ripokeke/Yawawa/Yufafa], was it? You have done well to return. The time for your next trial is at hand, kupo.
14828 : % and [Fhig Lahrv/Khuma Tagyawhan/Pimy Kettihl/Raka Maimhov/Sahyu Banjyao/Sufhi Uchnouma/Tsuim Nhomango/Yoli Kohlpaka], was it? You have done well to return. The time for your next trial is at hand, kupo.
14829 : % and [Durib/Dzapiwa/Jugowa/Mugido/Voldai/Wagwei/Zayag/Zoldof], was it? You have done well to return. The time for your next trial is at hand, kupo.
14830 : It's about time.
14831 : Bring it on!
14832 : ...I am ready.
14833 : Let's hear what you have in store for us this time.
14834 : Woo boy! My heart won't stop pounding.
14835 : Ahaha! These are the times I feel alive!
14836 : Why, I thought I'd die of waiting!
14837 : You hear that, %? Let's go!
14838 : I wonder what challenges await us this time.
14839 : Ooh, ooh! What's on the menu this time, Mister Moogle?
14840 : I am ready for whatever comes my way!
14841 : Spare us the dramatics and get on with it, would you?
14842 : Your eagerness is admirable, but let it not turn to impatience, lest it doom you to downfall...
14843 : Lost your item, have you? I fear I can provide no insurance for such irresponsibility. You will simply have to undertake the trial once more from the beginning.
14844 : But it is not all for naught, kupo. I am certain that the experience you have earned will serve you well.
14845 : Ah, you must be the one they call %. It's an honor to finally make your acquaintance.
14846 : My compatriot Joachim has told me much of your exploits. It'd be my pleasure to assist you any way I can.
14847 : Good day, %. Is there something you need?
14848 : What would like to ask about? I want %. Learn about %. Current % stock. Cavernous maw locations. Teleporting to a cavernous maw. Nothing right now.
14849 : All set for now, are we? I'll be right here if ever you have need of me.
14850 : Interested in the cavernous maws, are we?
14851 : La Theine Plateau, Konschtat Highlands, Tahrongi Canyon...
14852 : Jugner Forest, Valkurm Dunes, Buburimu Peninsula...
14853 : Xarcabard, North Gustaberg, South Gustaberg...
14854 : In these [zero/three/six/nine] areas gateway maws have manifested.
14855 : Planning a trip to Abyssea, I gather? You'd be wise to make a habit of taking stock of your % prior to departure.
14856 : The function of the % is twofold.
14857 : First and foremost, it's the key by which one gains entry to Abyssea.
14858 : Secondly, it serves as an anchor that secures one's essence to foreign dimensions.
14859 : A single stone is good for a #-minute (Earth time) jaunt in Abyssea, and up to # can be in your possession at any given time. Multiplying those two numbers will give you the limit of your stay.
14860 : One thing to remember is that a good twenty hours (Earth time) are required to fully charge one stone. As such, I might not always have one on hand. I must beg your patience in that case.
14861 : Here for your %? Let me see what I have for you...
14862 : Hm? Why, it appears you already have # stones. I'm sorry, %, but it'd be irresponsible of me to furnish you with any more. Heavens forbid I have a hand in stranding you in a foreign world.
14863 : Oh dear, I'm afraid I don't have any fully charged stones for you right now. Could you check back again in a while?
14864 : Here you are, %. That should suffice for the time being.
14865 : With the power of cruor, it's possible to teleport to any cavernous maw serving as a gateway to Abyssea. You only need to have visited that maw once before.
14866 : If you wish to go somewhere, a quick word with my assistant beside me here and you'll be off to your destination in the blinking of an eye.
14867 : It'll take me # more [minute/minutes] (Earth time) to fully charge another %.
14868 : You wish to know how many % I have for you? Why, that'd be # of them.
14869 : Obtained key item: # %!
14870 : Obtained key item: # %!
14871 : I'm sorry, but I don't believe we're acquainted. Please leave me be.
14872 : <Sigh>... To see such vistas of peace and prosperity restored to my homeland once more...
14873 : Greetings, friend of Abyssea. [/Ivan/Ernst/Kierron/Cyril/Willis/Vincent] is my name. My superior officer [/Gilburt/Erich/Jerrett/Adrian/Fabricius/Fabien] and I have been dispatched here to provide logistical support to allies of our cause.
14874 : As you endeavor to restore light to our ravaged world, so too will we endeavor to aid you in every possible way.
14875 : How might I assist you this day?
14876 : What would you like to ask about? My current cruor balance. Resistance outpost status. Teleporting to a cavernous maw. Nothing right now.
14877 : The figures in my logbook tell me you have # cruor to your name.
14878 : Ask about which area? Abyssea - Vunkerl. Abyssea - Misareaux. Abyssea - Attohwa. Never mind.
14879 : According to the latest intelligence reports...
14880 : This area's pulse martello defense rate presently stands at #%. The likelihood of an Abyssean horde invasion, on the other hand, is #%.
14881 : You wish to teleport to a cavernous maw? In that case, please tell me your precise destination.
14882 : Go to which area's gateway? Abyssea - La Theine. Abyssea - Konschtat. Abyssea - Tahrongi. Abyssea - Vunkerl. Abyssea - Misareaux. Abyssea - Attohwa. Abyssea - Altepa. Abyssea - Uleguerand. Abyssea - Grauberg. I've changed my mind.
14883 : # cruor is required for transport to the gateway to Abyssea - [La Theine/Konschtat/Tahrongi/Attohwa/Misareaux/Vunkerl/Altepa/Uleguerand/Grauberg].
14884 : Ah, it seems you have insufficient cruor to make that journey.
14885 : Will you proceed? (Cruor balance: #) Make it so. Make it no.
14886 : These martellos are defensive fortifications developed by the resistance to aid in our battle against the fell hordes. Enchanted structures, they may be employed to restore your health and magic, cure ailments, and generally restore you to fighting trim.
14887 : I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos...but this is none of your concern.
14888 : I have been entrusted with the supervision and maintenance of these martellos. Would you be needing something of me?
14889 : Need something? Assist with replenishment. Assist with upgrades. Martellos? Come again? Nothing in particular.
14890 : Splendid! Your aid is a great boon to the resistance effort. To replenish a martello, you'll need to insert one of these % into the structure.
14891 : Be forewarned: you will be unable to carry these and % at the same time.
14892 : Take along the %? Yes. No.
14893 : We would be particularly indebted to you for efficient replenishment of martellos in remote locations. Best of luck in your efforts!
14894 : Why, is that not % already in your posssesion? You need only insert that into a martello to initiate replenishment.
14895 : I see that you currently possess %. Do you wish to abandon your upgrading efforts and participate in replenishment instead?
14896 : You return the % and obtain % in its stead!
14897 : Your support is most heartening in these dark times. Upgrading a martello will require you to attach a device known as %.
14898 : Mind you, the device is rather unwieldy. You will not be able to carry it and % at the same time.
14899 : Excellent. I would be especially appreciative if you could upgrade those martellos in distant locations--the quicker the better. Be careful out there!
14900 : Hm? Is that not % you hold in your hand? You need only find the martello you wish to upgrade, and attach it.
14901 : Is that % I see? Do you wish to curtail your replenishment activities and assist with upgrading instead?
14902 : Welcome back, friend! Allow me to take that % off your hands. How did you fare in your efforts?
14903 : I see, I see... Martello #0#, you say? It sounds as if the operation was [a modest success./a reasonable success./a rousing success!/an unqualified success!]
14904 : The resistance greatly values your contributions. Take this as a small token of our appreciation, and do not hesitate to return the next time you are willing to lend your support.
14905 : I've been working with these here martellos since I was knee-high. Ask away, and my knowledge is yours.
14906 : Ask something? So, what's a martello? Martello replenishment. Martello upgrades. Cautionary notes. Not now.
14907 : The device we know as the martello was first developed by military engineers many years past, during an age of great war. Martellos serve to keep combatants fighting fit, healing their wounds and restoring their mental energies.
14908 : You will observe that martellos have been constructed in numerous locales, so as to provide strategically located safe havens for harried resistance fighters. No doubt you will find yourself making use of them as well.
14909 : In the bowels of each martello is contained a tank designed to hold martello fuel.
14910 : This % is the lifeblood of the martello, and the source of its curative powers. Depleted stores will render the device little more than an oversized parchmentweight.
14911 : That being the case, we're in continual need of volunteers willing to take on the vital task of replenishing these martellos.
14912 : I have been charged with overseeing a supply of martello fuel. Should you be willing to take part in a replenishment run, you need only say the word. Needless to say, you will not go unrewarded for your efforts.
14913 : Feast your eyes on this %. She's a beauty, isn't she? Installing one of these into a martello will increase its fuel capacity.
14914 : An upgraded martello will be able to sustain its energy stores for a longer time between replenishment operations. Needless to say, this is a blessing and a half to those on the battlefield.
14915 : Unfortunately, the installation procedure is quite complex. As such, we can only entrust it to experienced hands.
14916 : % are quite large and unwieldy. Even the burliest among us would be unable to carry one and % at the same time.
14917 : Furthermore, these materials are quite unstable, and will rapidly corrode and be rendered useless if brought outside our immediate environs.
14918 : 'Course, not that anyone could manage to travel that far, what with these fearsome landslides...
14919 : Warning: Changing areas, logging out, or becoming disconnected will cause all data pertinent to this quest to be reset.
14920 : Your % has been lost.
14921 : The resistance is currently suffering a materials shortage. Those wishing to participating in replenishment and upgrading operations should return at a later time.
14922 : The % breaks!
14923 : Table: #
14924 : Very well, friend. Should you ever find yourself in need of assistance, do not hesitate to return.
14925 : Hail, soldier. I am a purveyor tasked with furnishing the brave men and women of the Voidwatch with essential supplies. My wares can be yours, provided you've got [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes] to trade. After all, we can't afford to let our limited resources go to waste in the hands of some unproven rookie.
14926 : Procure supplies? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Not now. % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#).
14927 : How many? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: #) None, actually. One (Cost: #). Three (Cost: #), Six (Cost: #). Nine (Cost: #). Twelve (Cost: #).
14928 : This % will cost you # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
14929 : It seems you're short on [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing credits/Allied Notes], soldier. Come back when you've got a bit more seasoning under your belt.
14930 : Proceed? (Required [Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Yes. No.
14931 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
14932 : % obtains # % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
14933 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
14934 : This % will cost you # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
14935 : You already have %, and I'm not authorized to furnish you with another. Resources are in short supply. You'll have to make do with what you've already got.
14944 : How many? ( [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes]: #)
14945 : You may purchase up to # at a time.
14946 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
14947 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
14948 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
14949 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
14950 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
14951 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
14952 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
14953 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
14954 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
14955 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
14956 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
14957 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
14958 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
14959 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
14960 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
14961 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
14962 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
14963 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
14964 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
14965 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
14966 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
14967 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
14968 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
14969 : Deal, kupo? (Current gil: #). Check storable items. Deal. No deal.
14970 : The % will allow you to store the following items:
14971 : %.
14972 : %.
14973 : ...and that's all.
14974 : % (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
14975 : Warning! If you lose your % while storing a corresponding item, you will be forever unable to retrieve that item!
14976 : Is that % I see, kupo?
14977 : What will you do? Retrieve an item. Confirm storable items. Nothing.
14978 : Retrieve an item? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
14979 : Retrieve %? Retrieve it. Leave it.
14980 : You retrieve % from the porter moogle's care.
14981 : Kupo? I'm already taking care of that item for you.
14982 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
14983 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
14984 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
14985 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
14986 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
14987 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.
14988 : Why, it looks as if you have % located in your [inventory/Mog Safe/Mog Safe 2/Mog House storage/Mog Locker/Mog Satchel/Mog Sack/Mog Case/Mog Wardrobe/Mog Wardrobe 2/Mog Wardrobe 3/Mog Wardrobe 4/Mog Wardrobe 5/Mog Wardrobe 6/Mog Wardrobe 7/Mog Wardrobe 8/Recycle Bin]!

14999 : What's this? %? Ah, you must be one of the [adventurers/Allied soldiers] participating in the Voidwatch operation. Pray forgive my oversight.
15000 : If you could wait but one moment, I shall announce your arrival.
15001 : My apologies for the delay. You may proceed within.
15002 : Ah, you've come. I've heard much of your exploits. We are fortunate indeed to have you on our side.
15003 : No doubt you're wondering why I've summoned you here today.
15004 : Time is of the essence, so I'll get straight to the heart of the matter. We are engaged in an operation of the utmost importance, and I thought you'd be just the [man/woman] for the task.
15005 : As you may have already noticed, the Voidwalker threat grows more menacing by the day. In particular, the fiends we have encountered here in the vicinity of the Duchy are possessed of powers that dwarf their already-formidable brethren.
15006 : I hereby authorize you for participation in Voidwatch operations in the Jeuno region. Serve us well, and you will be duly compensated for your efforts.
15007 : You are not the only [adventurer/Allied soldier] I have recruited for this operation. Should you chance upon any others, you may join up with them if you so choose. The Duchy--no, the entire realm--is counting on you, %. Do not let us down.
15008 : So you have finally come. I am Mawl'gofaur, aide to the Archduke and overseer of the Voidwatch operation in His Excellency's absence.
15009 : I hear you have proven yourself capable on the field. The Grand Duchy has need of your services.
15010 : The Voidwalker threat grows ever more grave by the day. The fiends that have been sighted in the immediate vicinity of Jeuno, in particular, possess powers unlike anything we've seen before.
15011 : Were the Duchy to fall to this extradimensional menace, it would spell disaster for the realm. This should be evident to even a grunt such as yourself.
15012 : In the name of His Excellency Kam'lanaut, Archduke of Jeuno, I hereby authorize you for participation in all Voidwatch operations conducted under the Duchy's jurisdiction.
15013 : Mind you, you are not the only one to whom I have bestowed this clearance. Should you chance upon any of the others, you may band together against the fiends. Or do not. It matters little to me so long as you succeed in your efforts.
15014 : We lack for capable soldiers, so do try to stay alive. Now be off with you. More pressing matters require my attention.
15015 : The assignment of individual objectives will be handled by our officers stationed throughout the greater Jeuno region. Report to one posthaste to receive your orders.
15016 : Do not forget to report back to an officer upon completing an objective, lest your accomplishments go overlooked.
15017 : ...That is all. You are dismissed.
15018 : I remind you again...
15019 : Ah, you've returned! Your exploits in the Jeuno operation have been remarkable to observe. On behalf of the entire Grand Duchy, I commend you.
15020 : ...Very well. The next step is clear. I hereby authorize you to participate in our Qufim operation.
15021 : Again, I must warn you. The enemy you face in Qufim will be unlike anything you've faced thus far.
15022 : The Voidwalker menace grows more dire with each passing hour. Where do these beasts come from, and what brings them to our world? Sometimes it seems as if the tireless efforts of our researchers yield more questions than answers.
15023 : And yet we can do nothing but continue the fight. I'm counting on you, %.
15024 : On behalf of the Grand Duchy, I commend your efforts in the Jeuno Voidwatch operation. Yet the battle is far from won.
15025 : I hereby issue you your next assignment. You are to travel to the Qufim region and assist in our operation there.
15026 : The Voidwalker menace is at its most fierce in Qufim. We have already lost our share of capable men.
15027 : Do your best not to join them. Now be along on your way.
15028 : %! I've received word of your accomplishments in Qufim. Truly, your service to the Voidwatch has exceeded even my initial expectations.
15029 : %! I've received word of your accomplishments. Truly, your service to the Voidwatch has exceeded even my initial expectations.
15030 : And yet it is hardly the time to rejoice. You have seen it with your own eyes--no sooner is one fiend slain than another of its brethren emerges to take its place.
15031 : We must find a way to seal the planar rifts. Then, and only then, will we be able to quash this extradimensional menace once and for all.
15032 : Even as we speak, an elite team of my best researchers works tirelessly to that very end. Sadly, the true nature of the rifts remains very much an enigma...
15033 : And so I have no choice but to employ capable adventurers such as yourself to keep the fiends at bay. As inefficient as it may seem, it is the best course of action available to us under these conditions.
15034 : We are counting on your continued efforts, %. In the meantime, take this for your service. May it serve you well.
15035 : Admirable work in Qufim, soldier. I did not think you had it in you. His Excellency has expressed great satisfaction in your accomplishments as well.
15036 : And yet we cannot afford to become complacent. For each fiend we dispatch, a more abominable monstrosity rises to take its place.
15037 : We have recovered much useful data from your encounters with the Voidwalkers. Data that an elite team of our best researchers works tirelessly to analyze.
15038 : Yes, we must discover a means to seal the rifts once and for all. Then, and only then, will victory truly be ours.
15039 : Until that day, we have no choice but to continue the fight.
15040 : You have proven yourself a valuable ally to our cause.
15041 : The Archduke himself trusts you greatly. That is one trust that you would do well not to betray.
15042 : Take this for your efforts, and do not let up the fight. We will be watching you with great interest, %.
15043 : Pssst! %!
15044 : Over here! This way, I say! It's me! Cait Sith, your feline friend!
15045 : Do forgive me for my appearance. Pardon my unfamiliar manifestation.
15046 : You may think of it as sort of passing fancy. A cait's caprice.
15047 : But there are more important matters a-paw. Matters that would best be discussed somewhere other than here, I fear.
15048 : Let us rendezvous in the Pashhow Marshlands of the past. The age-old swamp. It's quite a trek, so take care and don't be late! Ta-ta, %!
15049 : There [he/she] is, kupo! Wherever have you been, %?
15050 : Heh... % goes where adventure calls. But you can always trust [him/her] to show up when the time is right.
15051 : Kupo-ho! ...So that's how it works.
15052 : Well, look who's finally here. I was wondering how long you were going to keep me waitaruing.
15053 : Hm? Why's that?
15054 : Surely you haven't forgotten-wotten our contract, %. I intend to keep my end of the bargain, so you'd bettaru live up to yours.
15055 : Your mission, whether or not you choose to acceptaru it: amass # merit point[/s] and return here to me.
15056 : Why, you say? Oh, just a little experiment of sorts.
15057 : I've devised a method by which the power of merit points may be channel-wanneled to rip and wrench open the reserves of chakra that lie dormant within you.
15058 : Getting excitarued yet? 'Cause I sure am. So what are you waiting for? # merit point[/s], and make it snappy-wappy.
15059 : Rip and wrench? That sounds awfully...violent, kupo.
15060 : Indeed... And yet, it's a most accurate description. Heh heh...
15061 : Kupopo?
15062 : Hear me out, %. Be strong of body and mind, and there is no limit to the powers you can master.
15063 : You didn't sign that contract for the all-you-can-eat rarab tails, now, did you?
15064 : Believe in yourself, and go forward, %. Your destiny awaits.
15065 : Back so soon? That's our %!
15066 : Heh. Never met a challenge ye didn't like, eh?
15067 : Wow, you completed that task in a jiffy-wiffy. Looks like I made the right choice signing a contract with you.
15068 : Well then, let's get this show on the road. Don't worry, %--it'll be over in two shakes of a rarab's tail.
15069 : Kupopo? Is it prudent to proceed with the process so promptly?
15070 : Under normal circumstances, we'd take things a bit more slowly-wowly. But hey, % and I are people in demand. Aren't we, %?
15071 : When I say go, we're going to condense all the merit power you've accumulated into one pulsating mass of energy, then proceed to rippy-wip that straight out from the core of your soul.
15072 : Stay focused, and try not to blink. It might kill you.
15073 : K-kupo!?
15074 : ...
15075 : And that should do it!
15076 : Did we kill [him/her]?
15077 : Kupo...oh!?
15078 : I've noted this numerous times before, but you really have a remarkably resilient body, %.
15079 : It's all the trainin' [he's/she's] put in with yours truly.
15080 : Stand tall and proud...er, if you can still stand. The legendary power of the bushin is yours.
15081 : Kupo!? That's how you pass along the power of the bushin!?
15082 : It looked like you were just trying to blast poor % into smithereens!
15083 : More or less. It's the shock of the blastaru combined with the amassed power of %'s merit points that triggers the reaction.
15084 : By focusing all of those energies into one pulsating mass and ripping it out from within, we've opened up a veritable font of chakra inside %'s body.
15085 : A font...of chakra, kupo?
15086 : They say such stores of power exist inside us all, yet most will train a lifetime without ever learnin' how to tap into 'em...
15087 : You laid the foundation with your physical enhancements experiments, my fluttery, furry friend. I simply-wimply applied the finishing touches.
15088 : But let's get to the heart of the mattaru, %. What I've bestowed upon you today is but a foundation for powers that may yet be mastered.
15089 : Listen, and listen well. Look within and take stock of your merits, and you'll see a new path open to you.
15090 : Using the energies within you, I've burned into your soul the %. How you proceed from here is entirely up to you.
15091 : For this is not the end of your training, but only the beginning. Or were you just bluffing-wuffing when you said you wanted to take me on? Haha!
15092 : And with that, I'd best be off. I am a man in demand, after all.
15093 : Before that, though, I really could use a good meal and a...<yawn>...nap.
15094 : A man in demand? More like a lazy louse, kupo.
15095 : As enigmatic as our friend is, the realm may never know. Heh heh...
15096 : Let up not in your training, %. The path to true martial mastery lies before you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some rarab tails t'--er, I mean, my trainin' to get back to.
15097 : You learned the secret technique of the bushin!
15098 : You've come. Splendid. We regret having to summon you again so soon after your last tour of duty, but the Duchy has need of your services again.
15099 : Our research team has confirmed the presence of new rifts in the greater three nations area.
15100 : Under normal circumstances, the defense effort would fall under the jurisdiction of the local governments. This time, however, I fear the circumstances are far from normal.
15101 : I will be frank with you, %. The strength of the enemy is beyond anything we've faced thus far.
15102 : Here is your badge of authorization. Take it and report to the Voidwatch officers stationed afield for further orders.
15103 : Once again, we have recruited other promising adventurers to our cause. You may find it in your best interests to join up with them before taking on the enemy. We're counting on you, %.
15104 : I trust you've recovered from your last tour of duty. If not, so be it. Full strength or no, the Duchy requires your service.
15105 : Ducal researchers have alerted us to the presence of newly formed planar rifts in the vicinity of the three kingdoms.
15106 : Under normal circumstances we would let the nations fend for themselves. We fear that this time, however, their limited resources and manpower will do little to stem the tide of this formidable enemy.
15107 : Hence, we turn to you. Take this badge of authorization and present it to our officers afield for further orders.
15108 : We have recruited others for the effort as well. Join forces with them if you wish, or fight alone. Just remember: the success of the operation is more important than the life of any single soldier, including yours.
15109 : As we trust you are already aware...
15110 : Direct supervision of the Voidwatch operation will be conducted by our officers dispatched to the three nations. You are to follow their instructions to the letter.
15111 : %. Once again you prove that the Duchy's faith in you was not misplaced.
15112 : You are an asset to the Voidwatch. And yet the data we have recovered from your efforts yields as many questions as answers.
15113 : The Voidwalker menace has been quieted for now. Yet we would be fools to believe that our foe will remain silent for long.
15114 : Until we can identify and eliminate the source of the threat, we have no recourse but to call upon you again.
15115 : In the meantime, take this as recompense for your efforts. I trust you shall put it to good use.
15116 : What is the meaning of this interruption!?
15117 : My pardons. Your Excellency, we've received dire news from the field. Two new rifts have been confirmed at previously unbreached locations...
15118 : Hmph. Two, you say?
15119 : Aye. One buried in the sands of the Valkurm Dunes, the other on Buburimu Peninsula.
15120 : Your Excellency...?
15121 : This adventurer is a veteran Voidwatcher. I would have [him/her] hear your findings as well.
15122 : At present, it responds to neither % nor %. We are unable to gauge the potential danger of any Voidwalkers that may lie beyond.
15123 : Intriguing. So the portal between dimensions is not yet fully formed...
15124 : It is only a matter of time before the monsters spring forth. Let up your watch not for a second, and send word the moment you detect anything amiss.
15125 : Sir! Yes, sir!
15126 : It would seem your next mission will begin sooner rather than later, soldier.
15127 : We will authorize you for participation at such time as it is necessary. In the meantime, I suggest you rest up and prepare yourself for the challenges ahead.
15128 : Too much remains unknown about these rifts. I grow impatient with our researchers and their incessant pleas for more time.
15129 : I concur. The situation threatens to spiral out of control. We cannot afford to play the dispassionate observer for much longer.
15130 : % has proved a most useful...resource...in the pursuit of our goals.
15131 : And yet there are limits to what one adventurer--or even an army of them--can do. It seems that we have no choice but to get involved more...directly.
15132 : ...Yes, Your Excellency.
15133 : It would seem the Voidwatch effort in the three nations was a success. Once again, you prove yourself not entirely useless.
15134 : The Archduke will be pleased. And yet the Voidwalker menace persists.
15135 : The data we have recovered from your latest mission is...not promising.
15136 : More details? I think you forget your station, soldier. You will get the information you are authorized to receive, and no more.
15137 : Let it suffice to say that we will have need of your services again. Stay alive, and do not stray too far.
15138 : I am sure you understand why we have summoned you on such short notice. Yes, it does indeed concern the Voidwalkers.
15139 : Recently, however, some new facts have come to light. Reports confirm a new substance that can be culled from those planes-walking fiends.
15140 : It is said to possess two separate forms: one is that of a crystal, the other of a more granular structure resembling cruor. Its alabaster hue, however, serves to distinguish it from that vermilion currency.
15141 : While it may exhibit crystalline properties, it is unlike any specimen of crystal we have heretofore examined. The oft-used phrase shrouded in mystery does not begin to describe how it baffles even our most accomplished researchers.
15142 : We may have nothing more to guide us than conjecture, but we cannot discard the possibility that this mineral is an integral piece in the calamitous puzzle that Vana'diel faces. Do not hesitate to collect as large a sample as possible of this mysterious mineral.
15143 : Should you require further intelligence, seek out a Voidwatch Officer. As they are the ones who operate in the field, they should be privy to the most current of information.
15144 : Furthermore...
15145 : Whether as hardened stone or dust deposits, this substance is less than abundant.
15146 : Voidwatch Officers should be willing to part with some samples, however, should you fail to harvest any off of Voidwalker corpses.
15147 : No matter the method by which you obtain it, this mineral should shine new light on this catastrophe and allow you to more efficiently aid our cause.
15148 : To the extent of our knowledge, there is no new planar rift activity, but you of all people should understand the spontaneous nature of these interdimensional disturbances. None of us can let our guard down for even a moment.
15149 : Archduke Kam'lanaut expects great things of you as well. It is quite regrettable that he could not honor us with his presence today, but he is a busy man with many entice--er, engagements.
15150 : Now that you understand how you can be of service, it is time you got to your duties. Let us conclude this parley.
15151 : Hmm...something's not right here.
15152 : I would have expected their reports to have arrived by now...
15153 : Who's this then? An adventurer, I gather?
15154 : Well? Are you? Of course! No...
15155 : Please forgive my intrusion.
15156 : I wish you well in all your endeavors.
15157 : To find an adventurer such as yourself so quickly! Fortune indeed shines upon me this day!
15158 : But where are my manners? I have not yet introduced myself. I am Anastase, an emissary sent from the Sacred City of Adoulin.
15159 : But of course, you need not say anything. I know why you have sought me out.
15160 : You are here to assist me in surveying the geomagnetic founts, yes?
15161 : Lend your aid? I shall. Not interested. Hear more.
15162 : I see. I must admit to feeling a twinge of disappointment, but I understand.
15163 : My stay here will be a long one, so if you have a change of heart, please come and see me again.
15164 : Have you changed your mind? Will you help me study the geomagnetic founts?
15165 : I come from the Sacred City of Adoulin, an island that lies far to the west, beyond the great Sea of Zafmlug.
15166 : Further still beyond the island is the continent of Ulbuka, where a pristine expanse of nature sits unsullied by mortal hands.
15167 : Tales of men and women from the Middle Lands who cannot resist the clarion call of a good deed left undone have stretched across the sea and reached my ears. Hearing these tales prompted me to make the arduous journey here.
15168 : For you see, I desire your assistance in our quest to pioneer the undeveloped lands of Ulbuka.
15169 : I had hoped to secure transport in advance for those interested in cooperating with this enterprise.
15170 : But executing a plan is never a simple affair. Air and sea vessels are indeed available, but unsustainable in the long term due to the staggering distance between the two continents.
15171 : Yet one possibility exists. In our beloved city, devices called waypoints allow the user to instantaneously move from one location to another.
15172 : However, I am not certain whether the ley lines to which these waypoints are attuned traverse the oceans to the Middle Lands. My first task, therefore, is to find locations suitable for such travel.
15173 : % are needed to use our waypoints, but their efficacy is dependent on recording the energies of certain geomagnetic founts.
15174 : As part of this mission, I have brought with me several such %. What I would ask of you is that you take one to these various founts and attune it to them.
15175 : Unfortunately, there is precious little time to collect this information.
15176 : As I have previously mentioned, my fervent hope is that you will undertake this mission. The very fate of my homeland hangs in the balance.
15177 : What I ask is that you use % to...oh?
15178 : You mean to tell me that you already possess %? Then this will be all the easier!
15179 : This % is % for the Middle Lands.
15180 : What I would ask of you is that you attune the % to the aforementioned geomagnetic founts.
15181 : If this survey is successful, then it will surely guarantee a prosperous trading partnership for our two homelands.
15182 : I also imagine that there are many who would both honor and value your accomplishment.
15183 : Your help is sincerely appreciated. Let me present you with this %.
15184 : Attuning it to a geomagnetic fount will, if my calculations are correct, permit you to use the waypoints.
15185 : I have already recorded the energies of the Ru'Lude Gardens fount. Please, travel throughout the world and proceed with your activities, and return to me when you have attuned it to another fount.
15186 : Having never been to this land, I am not familiar with the exact locations, but our powers of divination have given us a certain cryptic insight.
15187 : Any questions? Tell me your prognostications. Tell me about these waypoints. Explain all this to me. None in particular.
15188 : Which prognostication? None, actually. How do I record these founts? <Port>.[ /: Complete] <Dwelling>.[ /: Complete] <Spring>.[ /: Complete] <Fort>.[ /: Complete]
15189 : Quwi Orihbhe, a member of our mission, has seen... A geomagnetic fount located in [a port named after a young woman/a dwelling located in plains dotted by craggy outcroppings/a gushing oasis bursting forth from the surrounding dunes/a hard-to-find locale carved out of rock].
15190 : I realize that these tips may confound more than confirm, but the features of this land are largely unbeknownst to me.
15191 : Yet now that I think of it, Quwi did leave further clues behind...
15192 : Pure white beaches... Clay... Disembowelment...
15193 : A long-necked beast... A chef in search of meat from that beast... The Old Lady...
15194 : A windmill... A large lake... An island where sand stretches to the sky...
15195 : Samurai and ninjas... Pirates... Contraband...
15196 : Well, this certainly is quite perplexing. I only apologize that I cannot help you further.
15197 : If you solve these riddles and find a geomagnetic fount, all you must do is hold up your % to the location.
15198 : Quite a simple task, no?
15199 : I shall be waiting here to collect your % when you have completed this endeavor.
15200 : Many years have I spent researching and analyzing these phenomena. Sensing any changes in the object I have given you is merely a trifle.
15201 : To a layman's eyes, though, any deviations are impossible to detect.
15202 : My hope is that, should these portals become fully active, even the uninitiated will be able to make such determinations with ease.
15203 : I am sure you have noticed this mysterious device resting at my side. In Adoulin, we refer to items of its ilk as waypoints.
15204 : These portals enable instantaneous transportation between two locations simply by holding up % to them.
15205 : I am sure that now you understand the implications of my calling--if the geomagnetic founts are as strong as our research implies, then the waypoints should function here, as well.
15206 : As we record information about the founts, we should be able to warp between more locations.
15207 : However, there is always a price to be paid for convenience. Warping consumes a tiny bit of energy extracted from certain types of crystals.
15208 : This energy, which in my field's parlance is referred to as kinetic units, is imbued in % when extracted from these crystals.
15209 : Kinetic units are consumed each time you warp, meaning that periodic imbuing is necessary for continued use of the waypoints.
15210 : Ah yes, before I forget--other members of my expedition have already gone to survey these locations.
15211 : Should you happen to cross paths with them, make sure to emphasize that I am still waiting for their reports.
15212 : May Altana keep you safe in this quest.
15213 : Hail, and good tidings. May I please take a look at your %?
15214 : ...!
15215 : This...this is amazing!
15216 : You have traveled to the # locations I have requested and recorded the data in the geomagnetic founts there!
15217 : Adventurers are truly as reliable as I was led to believe. All in a day's work, I suppose.
15218 : You have my undying gratitude for your efforts. Allow me to present this to you as a mere token of my appreciation.
15219 : As an aside, did you happen to meet with any of the other members of my expedition?
15220 : Though a bit wet behind the ears, their skills and talents are unparalleled.
15221 : Among their ranks are geomancers and rune fencers--a rare sight in the Middle Lands, to be sure.
15222 : If you were to visit Adoulin, you may be able to find out about their secrets for yourself.
15223 : Forgive my loose tongue. Some things should be found out for oneself.
15224 : My efforts now are focused on obtaining information about any more geomagnetic founts that may exist. I may have more information for you at a later date.
15225 : %, my friend! It is good to see you again. With what may I assist you today?
15226 : Any questions? Let's expand these warp options. Any new predictions? What about these waypoints? What am I supposed to do again? None in particular.
15227 : Utterly magnificent! I suppose adventurers always have to have a sixth sense about these sorts of things.
15228 : I have just received word that my colleague, Quwi Orihbhe, has predicted the existence of geomagnetic founts in new lands.
15229 : Would you like to hear more information about these hotspots?
15230 : Which spot are you interested in? None. How do I record data? <Green Light>.[ /: Complete] <Clear Waters>.[ /: Complete] <Crowned Tower>.[ /: Complete] <Deep Cliffs>.[ /: Complete] <Windmill>.[ /: Complete] <Dust Cloud>.[ /: Complete] <Lakeside>.[ /: Complete] <Swamps>.[ /: Complete] <Backbone>.[ /: Complete] <Crags>.[ /: Complete] <Silver>.[ /: Complete]
15231 : Hmm, let's see... [A green light at the end of a dark prison/A roaring dragon bound for clear waters/A tower crowned with the name of an orchid/The depths of cliffs that cleave plains in twain/The power to run through a windmill-dotted land/The foot of a precipice where dust clouds rage/Crimson shears sleeping by a forested lakeside/Ceaseless raindrops in swampy land/A mountain range where dragon bones form an arc/Gigantic crags where undying feathers rain down/A corridor hidden by a silver shield]...
15232 : ...
15233 : Would that I could help you more, but this is the extent of Quwi's divination.
15234 : Yet I trust that one such as yourself, an adventurer of the highest caliber, will decipher these faint musings...
15235 : ...and elucidate what lies beyond!
15236 : I shall remain here with ears trained for word of your success.
15237 : Ah yes, %. I had been hoping you would grace me with your presence.
15238 : I have just received a report from Quwi Orihbhe that...hm?
15239 : What is this aura I sense coming from your %? May I...?
15240 : ...?
15241 : ...! You...you have already recorded the geomagnetic founts!?
15242 : Impossible! Does this mean that you, too, possess the power of prognostication?
15243 : Or, perhaps, are the geomagnetic founts of the Middle Land so rich in power that...? No, such a conclusion goes in the face of decades of research!
15244 : Ah! Forgive my sudden outburst. Your actions have stirred latent emotions within me.
15245 : Setting that aside--there is no denying that you have recorded the information I desired.
15246 : You have convinced me that the ability to further your scope of operations is a blessing like none other.
15247 : I presume it best to offer you this in compensation for your troubles...even though in this case, you have completed my task without any intervention on my part.
15248 : The vim and vigor of you adventurers surely knows no bounds!
15249 : To imagine that one could accomplish my charge without shedding as much as a drop of sweat! And now, for your reward.
15250 : Still, I have one concern. My compatriots have yet to return from their dispatch.
15251 : Though you have indicated to me that they are in good health, I remain concerned...
15252 : Each must have their own reasons for not returning. With every step, a new journey...
15253 : Their commitment to our research must preclude their return. If that is so, then I must remain diligent as well!
15254 : I shall inform you when I have new predictions in place, and pray that you will aid me yet again when the time comes.
15255 : Any questions? Must have more warp destinations! Any new founts? What about these waypoints? What do I do again? Thanks, but no thanks.
15256 : I sense the hands of fate have bound us together through our mutually insatiable curiosity.
15257 : And yes, my intrepid friend, Quwi Orihbhe has found yet more locations for us...well, you...to examine.
15258 : Would you like to hear more?
15259 : Which prediction would you like to hear? None. How do I record the areas? <Abandoned Village>.[ /: Complete] <Malediction>.[ /: Complete] <Faeries>.[ /: Complete] <City Ruins>.[ /: Complete] <Grotto>.[ /: Complete] <Shrine>.[ /: Complete] <Forest>.[ /: Complete] <Urban Locale>.[ /: Complete] <Belfry>.[ /: Complete] <Darkness>.[ /: Complete]
15260 : Hmm... What can I give you to go on? [A church standing in an abandoned village/Beyond a hall wrapped in curses/An abode of faeries worshipping a living god/A city swallowed by the land/An eroded cave where space twists and turns/A temple where those who have lost darkness reside/Moss that glistens deep within a gigantic tree/A city constructed by nomadic beastmen/Another beautiful ring of a bell/The farthest reaches of the blackest depths].
15261 : Would that I could tell you more, but as previously, I can only relay what was told to me.
15262 : Just as you have overcome past trials and tribulations, so too shall you triumph this day.
15263 : I believe in you!
15264 : May your steps be swift and your blades true.
15265 : As you most likely have presumed, Quwi Orhibhe has...oh?
15266 : ...! The founts are...already recorded!?
15267 : What...what sorcery is this?
15268 : Do you have feelers throughout the far reaches of the land? Or...are you a wizard?
15269 : My feeble mind cannot comprehend how you have already found the geomagnetic founts that have only just now been divined. H-how...
15270 : I do not know by what means you have obtained such information, but I sense that it was some extra-dimensional force...where information is contained for all to see.
15271 : I am pleased that you have returned safely. May I see your %?
15272 : Your efforts have taken you to lands both far and wide. I congratulate you on having trekked so far throughout Vana'diel.
15273 : There are no words to describe how I feel for all you have done. Even my most compelling reward is an insufficient prize.
15274 : Have you gotten used to using our warp technology? Is it to your liking?
15275 : The theoretical magical calculations behind these waypoints are based on, if my records are correct, studies done here in the Middle Lands.
15276 : I was but a fledgling researcher at that time, so I am a tad hazy on the details of it all, but my journey from Adoulin has more meaning in light of that fact.
15277 : What would you like to know? What about these waypoints? I need more information.   Can I give you a hand with...you know? Thank you, and good day.
15278 : Hmm? Whatever do you mean?
15279 : I suppose I shouldn't hide behind blank stares...
15280 : For you see, warping to incredibly dangerous locales is, at times, truly frightening. Though I am aware you chose this option out of curiosity...
15281 : Knowing what I have just told you, would you still like to accept this task?
15282 : Accept his task? It couldn't hurt...much. On second thought... Tell me more.
15283 : A dead adventurer is of no use to anyone. I cannot fault you for choosing the better part of valor.
15284 : What I am about to tell you has never before occurred in Adoulin, so I admit to being at a bit of a loss.
15285 : Parties representing, er, former patrons of these waypoints have reported certain...anomalies. Specifically, they occasionally fall down from the heavens. Splat.
15286 : My confidantes have been working tirelessly to determine the root cause, and our working theory is that over time, the recorded information becomes weak and unstable.
15287 : I would ask that you take this % and warp to the problematic locales.
15288 : Once there, you can confirm the integrity of the spot and correct the recorded information as necessary.
15289 : This all sounds more complicated than it really is. All you must do is re-attune the stone to the geomagnetic fount.
15290 : As you have likely gathered, the instability means that I cannot guarantee that you will arrive at your intended destination.
15291 : You could end up facing monsters tooth and claw, or be surrounded by an impenetrable mist that seeps into your very soul.
15292 : Quite fraught with peril, indeed.
15293 : Yet if anyone could accomplish this task, it would be you.
15294 : Y-you mean it? I had just been bluffing, but you're really going to...?
15295 : Are you absolutely sure? Adventure awaits! You couldn't pay me enough.
15296 : An adventurer you are, in the literal sense of the word!
15297 : Let me respond to your courageous request with the utmost confidence!
15298 : I hereby present you with this %. Take it with you to areas for which the recorded data has begun to deteriorate.
15299 : There are several locations in question. Which will you choose?
15300 : Just how tough do you want this to be? On second thought... Tough as butter. Tough as nails. Tough as diamond. I require further explanation.
15301 : So be it then. I have prepared the waypoint for your use.
15302 : May you come back in one piece!
15303 : Back for more? Very well. Pick your poison.
15304 : That twinkle in your eye... Is that success I sense?
15305 : Your %, please!
15306 : Yes, the data for the geomagnetic fount has been recorded properly.
15307 : From recording to fixing...is there nothing that adventurers cannot do? Here, a token of my esteem.
15308 : Well, would you look...
15309 : I am quite pleased to see that you have returned whole.
15310 : Do not be worried. Though you may not have succeeded this time, the important thing is the waypoints did not spell out your demise.
15311 : It is my understanding, %, that you deign to serve as a pioneer in Adoulin.
15312 : Oh yes, not only do I have ears everywhere, but I can see that glowing % you hold in your very hands.
15313 : My granddaughter guides those new to Adoulin, instructing them in the mysteries of waypoints. Please, give her my regards if you meet her by happenstance.
15314 : She is a sweet girl, very refined, thanks largely to her strict upbringing. I am sure that she will provide you with any assistance you should require.
15315 : Why, %! What a most pleasant surprise. How can I help you this fine... What's this? A present from my beloved Alienor?
15316 : What a thoughtful young lady she has grown up to be, making me such a delectable treat.
15317 : You wish to know more about how our research is going? Well, to be frank...I have not received word from [Jillia/Zurko-Bazurko/Quwi Orihbhe/Wistful Bison] of late.
15318 : I hesitate to ask this of you, since I am certain you have other pressing matters to attend to, but would you deliver some of this % to [Selbina/Mhaura/Rabao/Norg] for me?
15319 : The enchanting smell of brine upon the wind... A tantalizing dish from a devoted granddaughter... What more is there to life?
15320 : There is always a snag somewhere with complicated operations such as the one we are engaged in here. This time, I have not received word from [Jillia/Zurko-Bazurko/Quwi Orihbhe/Wistful Bison].
15321 : Thank you for checking up on [Jillia/Zurko-Bazurko/Quwi Orihbhe/Wistful Bison]. I am relieved to hear that all is well.
15322 : Please tell Alienor that I am grateful for her gift and that the people here in Jeuno are treating me with the utmost kindness.

15371 : What manner of farce is this?
15372 : An uncouth Tarutaru claiming to be an esteemed guest of Lady Esha'ntarl is running amok demanding the Trust initiative scroll.
15373 : My stomach churns each time this ruffian brings up the lady's honorable name. Filth and lies!
15374 : Ah! There she is! That dastardly Tarutaru!
15375 : Uh-oh!
15376 : The scroll! To think she got her grubby hands on it...!
15377 : I cannot comprehend the depth of her audacity to steal from the Auroral Palace!
15378 : I beseech you, adventurer--smash her like a pane of glass!
15379 : Don't just flop around there! Help meee!
15380 : Esha'ntarl said I could have it!
15381 : The world never appreciates the endless comedic antics of the Chebukki Show!
15382 : There's no way I'd ever hit it big, so instead, I decided I'd save the world with the scroll...
15383 : I'm thinking of starting a troupe called The Buxom Bosom Buddies--with me as the chest--err, headliner!
15384 : Of course, I can't do it alone. I'll have to get Ulmia, and Esha'ntarl, and that lovely Mumor...
15385 : Of course, I can't do it alone. I'll have to get Ulmia, and Esha'ntarl, and...well, I suppose you're pretty satisfactory, too.
15386 : And when it comes to the grand finale, we'll need something flashy. Something that only two of me can do.
15387 : So that's where my alter ego comes in!
15388 : Wh-why are you waiting? Scrape that villainous scum from Vana'diel this minute!
15389 : Smash her to bits? Let me get my hammer. I want to see how this plays out.
15390 : A snip and a snap and a pile of...maps? A sneer and a tear, time to warp outta here!
15391 : Stop being a fish out of water, and become the [bosom buddy/fan club president] you always knew you could be!
15392 : Remember when that old fuddy-duddy exploited your goodwill and had you gather all manner of trinkets for him? We'll use them as props in our revue!
15393 : And I think I know who the most delicious male backup dancers would be!
15394 : I'm sure Papa will help too!
15395 : He'll be in charge of the big kaboom that accompanies us taking the stage!
15396 : Think of it! The ultimate magic, brought to fruition by me and me alone!
15397 : So, you see?
15398 : Trust time!
15399 : What does the ritual require? Bonds of trust. Bonds of camaraderie. Bonds of friendship.
15400 : Trust. Yes, with trust I will have you under my...
15401 : Camaraderie. Yes, a true sign of weakness...
15402 : Friendship. Ah yes, how much have I lost so far...?
15403 : This is ridiculous! We don't have a single one of those!
15404 : <Sigh>
15405 : Then there's only one thing to do! Me...!
15406 : What comes next? ...te...!
15407 : ...or?
15408 : !!!
15409 : A whispering voice floats to your ears from nowhere in particular...
15410 : You are to truuuuuust Cherukiki!
15411 : You are to loooooove Cherukiki!
15412 : Cherukiki is your friiiiiiend!
15413 : What's this infernal spell!? Has something happened!?
15414 : Soldier, to me! This Tarutaru ruffian is at the bottom of it all!
15415 : You want an alter ego that can use the ultimate magic, don't you?
15416 : A final fantasy worthy of any adventurer!
15417 : She...she escaped...
15418 : The talking rat was scurrying about your pockets while you lay prone, so I advise you to check your belongings.
15419 : By Altana above, my eyes must be failing me. Suddenly there were two of them!
15420 : I swear...right before she left...
15421 : You find the small scroll Cherukiki was holding crumpled in your bags.
15422 : You cannot shake the feeling that she is pulling a fast one...
15423 : Who came up with this Trust magic, anyway? Bah. And what use would you have for it?
15424 : Hey there, %! You're familiar with this Trust magic, aren't you?
15425 : Are you involved with the initiative? Sure am! Definitely not!
15426 : Is that so? ...Then all the better for me.
15427 : ...Then you've already got some alter egos? The whole idea makes my skin crawl.
15428 : And, of course, you're going to say you want me to sacrifice myself so you can have another one, hmm?
15429 : Would you like Maat's alter ego? Indubitably. Eeew.
15430 : Oh, praise Altana! I thought for a minute that...
15431 : <Sigh>
15432 : You adventurers are all the same. It wasn't so long ago that you would face your challenges head-on with the strength of pure will, but now it's all Kupipi this and Ulmia that!
15433 : What'll you do if they decide to go rogue, hmm? You've got to learn how to fend for yourself, too!
15434 : If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times. Limits were made to be broken, and that's something only you can do!
15435 : So what am I going to do with this scroll I have? Burn it and use the ashes as fertilizer!
15436 : Maat! Maat! I come bearing tidings of trouble!
15437 : Wh-what is it!? Is Jeuno under attack!?
15438 : Oh, dear, the air is filled with angst, kupo!
15439 : It's your wife! She..she... She's waltzing down the warpath!
15440 : You left the laundry to languish, forgot to fix the floor, and instead are traipsing about town!
15441 : That doesn't sound right. The floor is sparkling like glass in the morning sun, and I remember folding her unmentionables got me thinking of the time when...
15442 : No no no! Those Asuran Fists of yours pounded her panties with such preposterous puissance that they perished in a plume of particles which are presently piling up around your pad!
15443 : And that troublesome technique you try on travelers...Bear Killer, was it? It caused the ceiling to crumble, and now there are numerous nicks and notches furrowing into the floor!
15444 : ...I'm a dead man.
15445 : Did you at least remember to get the groceries, kupo?
15446 : I-I went! But I damned near threw my back out lugging the stuff around, so I had one of 'em spry fellas near the stalls haul 'em back for me.
15447 : That's not cunning...that's cheating.
15448 : But even if I were to return and get 'em m'self...
15449 : It'd be too late.
15450 : So you want to absolutely avoid heading home?
15451 : But if I don't bring you back, she'll scour my skin and skewer my sides!
15452 : Sorry, little friend, but I'm not doing it!
15453 : Kupo! Not entirely unexpected.
15454 : Your loving wife may lamentably leave you, kupo!
15455 : B-but I don't want to spend the end of my days rotting alone!
15456 : ...Dare I entertain the thought? Maybe if I had an alter ego...
15457 : One of the academics from the Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies told me something when I received my scroll.
15458 : The energies of Trust magic are a representation of the bonds of trust, friendship, and camaraderie between two individuals.
15459 : Perhaps...perhaps I should rethink my stance. If I can serve others, then so be it.
15460 : %! Steel yourself!
15461 : How many times have we sparred, and how many times have you emerged the victor? If anyone has strong bonds with me, it would be you!
15462 : Do you remember the trials the Magian Moogles gave? The ones you passed with flying colors?
15463 : Power comes from the gut, my [boy/girl]. And using a gut like yours, my alter ego would be able to withstand any sucker punch my wife throws its way!
15464 : A stomach smacker? My tummy trembles at the thought, kupo...
15465 : You were also made to suffer the ill effects of brown magic as a bit of an...experiment.
15466 : When you say it that way, it sounds so sordid.
15467 : But now you've got a liver of steel! My alter ego should be able to withstand any shots to the organs my honey might dish out!
15468 : There was also that time when I engaged in a fierce struggle with my eternal nemesis, Degenhard. Boy, you sure got caught up in our squabbles--but somehow remained unscathed.
15469 : I thought my aura would be too much for you to handle, but you pulled through by the skin of your teeth.
15470 : ... That's not how it happened, kupo.
15471 : My old lady's got a bit of a fire aura herself, so any alter ego I make with you can surely withstand the heat!
15472 : I also remember those special eastern techniques they put you through when you were frustrated with your limits once more.
15473 : I can still see the look on that old biddy Chamama's face when that...thing came out of you. Half disgust, half curiosity.
15474 : ...I'd be careful about calling a budding beauty like her a biddy.
15475 : Surely the alter ego we create will woo my wife into a lovelorn stupor!
15476 : (She'd slap him silly if she saw his bluster and bravado, kupo...)
15477 : This'll flare up some painful memories, but... Remember that infernal contract you signed?
15478 : The one with Atori-Tutori?
15479 : Far be it from me to use the term lust for power, but...well, you're a braver [man/woman] than I!
15480 : Beyond doubt, the alter ego we call into being will fear nothing--nor will it sweat the small stuff!
15481 : Such arrogant apologies would make her apoplectic, kupo...
15482 : And finally, do you remember when I gave you a little present?
15483 : When the time comes, and I pass on...
15484 : I want you to take my hat, stand here in my place, and spread your wings.
15485 : But I don't cling to illusions. I know you want to go out there, adventure, and meet lots of [pretty young women/strapping young lads].
15486 : Maybe...maybe I could join too, kupo?
15487 : Floating here is as boring as balancing boxes.
15488 : Mayhaps my alter ego'd be a help then... His back would give out easily, though, so don't make it too tough on him! Heh heh.
15489 : <Sigh>... Such a base boor you can be...
15490 : I'd hurry up, kupo. Maat's tremendously tired.
15491 : In any event. The bonds we share will surely cultivate something special!
15492 : If you say no, then... ...then I've got to face the music.
15493 : And Maat was never deft at dancing, kupo.
15494 : Urk... Please! I'm begging you! Don't give up on me now!
15495 : Success, kupo!
15496 : We did it!
15497 : All who face me are like guppies before a shark! Heh heh heh!
15498 : Positively peachy! Now you can turn the tides against your storming spouse!
15499 : M-my...spouse...?
15500 : Go forth, my alter ego! I'm getting tired of sleeping in the doghouse!
15501 : B-but what if she takes her wrath out on me!? Forget it, I'm not going!
15502 : I knew it straight from the start, kupo!
15503 : Have heart, Maat! There are always ample supplies of adventurers!
15504 : <Sigh> I suppose you're right...after all, I've worked hard these long years.
15505 : Good luck with all your alter egos, %, and remember to never give up, no matter the cost!
15506 : Phew. When I agreed to get involved with the Trust initiative, I didn't imagine it to be so...trying.
15507 : Hmmmmmm... I was sure poring over these annals of history would be enough.
15508 : Oh ho? Do my eyes deceive me, or are you a Trust initiate?
15509 : Are you an initiate? No... Uh, what are you doing?
15510 : No? Then perhaps I need to take a break. I thought I read your magical aura properly, but my endless hours of study must have taken their toll.
15511 : Well, there was the one gentlewoman who claims to have called forth an alter ego all by herself.
15512 : Could you imagine what this means for our research? We may be on the verge of an incredible breakthrough!
15513 : Rumors say that intimate knowledge of the person she was trying to summon was sufficient to complete the ritual. So here I am, researching, trying to replicate her success with a historical figure.
15514 : But it's no good. Without the bonds, we just can't do it! The closest we've come is to craft ciphers--magical parchments that concentrate energies from a third party into physical forms. But that's the rub: it still requires those bonds in the first place.
15515 : But someday...someday...
15516 : Where are my manners? You didn't come here to hear a stuffy scholar's ramblings.
15517 : And just look at you! Fascinating...
15518 : Yes, your aura... I've done it again, haven't I? A thousand pardons. I asked if you were part of the Trust initiative, but you are so much more than that.
15519 : Take this % as a gift from the institute. It's a cipher crafted from the very process I spoke of earlier.
15520 : The emotions of separate individuals converted into magical energy. Extraordinary, wouldn't you agree? Calling forth an alter ego with the thoughts of a third party.
15521 : It's all very experimental, so I make no promises as to the efficacy of such a scroll. It's all we can do to keep the energies from collapsing in on themselves.
15522 : Unlike a traditional scroll, these ciphers cannot be recited by anyone with a passing level of literacy. They require the assistance of certain institute staff located in major cities throughout Vana'diel.
15523 : Still, I promise the journey will be worth it...for you, and for us.
15524 : Bonds cannot be severed like a hot knife cutting through Selbina butter. The key is whether or not the strengths of the bonds' creators are enough to survive transcription.
15525 : If there's someone who you feel a strong connection with, what can it hurt to ask them for their cooperation? You'll never know until you try!
15526 : Hello. Can I help you?
15527 : Hm? You're here about %?
15528 : I'm sorry you came all this way, but I've already been briefed on that particular topic.
15529 : Wait just a moment. Ah, now I remember you. Yes, I've been looking for you ever since our last encounter. Now, I need you in the field to help with my research...
15530 : Ah, forgive me. I was so excited to find the person I was looking for, I forgot to explain what it is I'm doing.
15531 : I've heard from a colleague that my research into Trust magic has earned the recognition of an academic organization.
15532 : They have even given me clearance to read their most confidential documents in pursuit of my research. Well, a portion of them at least.
15533 : However, when comparing that information against what I had gathered, I came across some interesting discoveries.
15534 : For example, I learned that you had defeated an unusual life-form considered to be the physical embodiment of the darkest parts of a person's soul.
15535 : Then it struck me--a new line of thought in my Trust magic research.
15536 : That's right. I'm researching the topic of a dark Trust magic!
15537 : How will you respond? Dark Trust magic? I see where this is going.
15538 : Huh? You mean you don't know?
15539 : Oh you do, do you?
15540 : Well, allow me to briefly explain things just in case.
15541 : Currently, the Trust magic you use is based on light. It draws on positive forces such as trust, friendship, and [brotherly/sisterly] love.
15542 : On the other hand, Trust magic based on darkness draws upon negative forces to generate its magic, much like how that woman was able to accomplish what she did.
15543 : Oh, I suppose I'm leaving out some rather important information. That is to say, an explanation of the negative aspects of mankind's darker side.
15544 : I'm basically referring to things like apathy, arrogance, cowardice, envy, and rage. You know, the darkest parts of one's soul. I believe that everybody harbors these feelings, at least to a certain extent.
15545 : In a sense, all of us are united by the darkness within our souls. Therefore, it only seems logical to infer that we have the necessary conditions to employ Trust magic from it.
15546 : All that remains is to try and elevate the darkness within the alter ego's soul and somehow link up with it...a type of bond all its own.
15547 : Although, even if we are unable to utilize the Trust magic, we have the % at our disposal. Intimate knowledge of your quarry should enable you to form a bond with them.
15548 : Which brings me to my request. I'd like for you to test your mettle against those unique forces. However, it cannot be any regular fight. You must really get to know your opponent.
15549 : I requested the A.M.A.N. to create a Records of Eminence objective for this purpose, so it should help you remain cognizant of your opponent during battle.
15550 : Hm? You want to know how to fight this particular opponent again? I think you probably know more about that sort of thing than I do.
15551 : You learn more about Trust magic, and I get further along in my research. That's what I call a win-win.
15552 : I heard from my colleague that he obtained a rather unusual cipher. Perhaps you should see this through to its conclusion?
15553 : Ah, it's you again. It seems everything went rather well.
15554 : Judging by the magical aura you're giving off, I'd say we got the results I was hoping for.
15555 : Keep in mind that Trust magic research is an ongoing process. I must continue my efforts to unlock its mysteries.
15556 : I'm working on preparations for my next study. Please come by again later.
15557 : Hello again. I've finished making the necessary preparations. This is the data I'm searching for this time.
15558 : Thanks again for your help.
15559 : If the test results for this darkness-based Trust magic follow my hypothesis, then my next step will be to research Trust magic that combines the power of both light and darkness.
15560 : I believe Trust magic that combines the power of light and darkness no longer just gives rise to alter egos, but a unique form of existence.
15561 : An alter ego combining the power of both light and darkness... Just think of what this could mean!
15562 : Although, I'm currently suffering from a lack of research samples.
15563 : In order to successfully realize dark-based Trust magic, I tried replicating the connection that my research was based on, but it is not going so well...
15564 : If only I could get to the truth of the matter, it could be like a ticket to eternal paradise without the unfortunate precursor of dying first.
15565 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
15566 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
15567 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
15568 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
15569 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).
15570 : Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.
15571 : The % nods in agreement.
15572 : new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
15573 : new Records of Eminence objective, %, is now available!
15574 : You wish to exchange your sparks?
15575 : Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
15576 : Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
15577 : Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
15578 : Thanks to your donation, I now have # % in safekeeping.
15579 : Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
15580 : Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
15581 : Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
15582 : Why? What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
15583 : Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of # % from you.
15584 : You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
15585 : Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
15586 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
15587 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
15588 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
15589 : Grrreat! Now I have # % from you. Thanks!
15590 : Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
15591 : I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
15592 : Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
15593 : I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
15594 : Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of # % for you.
15595 : Records of Eminence is a system brought to you by the caring folks at the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Set your own objectives whenever you desire, and fulfill them to receive compensation.
15596 : To set these tasks, select 'Objective List' from the Quests menu, then choose ones that suit your fancy.
15597 : You will be rewarded with gil and sparks of eminence, which serve the same function as points, notes, credits, and other such methods of quantifying one's greatness. As an extra incentive, adventurers will earn three times the amount of sparks for completing an objective the first time.
15598 : Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
15599 : As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
15600 : Lastly, any and all acts of vandalism directed against your % are strictly prohibited.
15601 : Should you be found in violation of this dictum, the heavens will part and wrath incarnate will descend to mete out justice upon you.

15625 : Once you accumulate # of these marks, they will be automatically converted to one % and added to the total number held.
15626 : Though I am only authorized to accept a limited selection of equipment at present, the A.M.A.N. is considering making further additions to this list, so please check back regularly.
15627 : Would you like # reclamation mark[/s] in exchange for one %? You currently have # mark[/s].
15628 : Proceed with the exchange? Yes. No.
15629 : The reclaimer awards you with # reclamation mark[/s] for a total of #.

15631 : You are unable to trade that item at present.
15632 : You are unable to trade that item because you cannot store any more %.
15633 : Only those participating in Records of Eminence may trade in items.
15634 : You can't shake the feeling that you may be able to learn about Ygnas's whereabouts somewhere in this area.

15667 : Resetting rewards will increase the number of deeds required but will let you reobtain items you have previously received.
15668 : You are able to reset your rewards for # deed[/s].
15669 : Reset rewards? Yes. (Reset ##) No.
15670 : You have not yet received some rewards. Resetting means that you will be unable to obtain them. Are you sure?
15671 : Really reset rewards? Yes. (Reset ##) No.
15672 : Rewards have been reset.
15673 : Why I never! One with such a meager aura is not fit to be in my presence, let alone speak to me!
15674 : Well, it took you long enough to come speak with me! I have been sending furtive glances your way for what seems like an eternity now!
15675 : You know, you really should give up on helping Jamal with his utterly pointless research.
15676 : Like everything he does, it is destined to end in abject failure.
15677 : Hm? What do you mean it is none of my business?
15678 : Do you know who you are speaking to? I am Marjory, the most brilliant magician this realm has ever seen, and the foremost expert on Trust research!
15679 : I am somewhat surprised you did not already know that. At any rate, there is a certain matter I need your help with.
15680 : Will you help her? Sure. No thanks.
15681 : H-how dare you decline my offer... You will come to regret this, I assure you!
15682 : I am pleased to see you make such a wise decision! Hehe... I cannot wait to see that buffoon Jamal choke on his own words!
15683 : Now then! Jamal likes to equate the darkness of alter egos to the root of all evil or some such nonsense, but as with most things, he could not be more wrong.
15684 : These are just my thoughts on the issue, but...
15685 : You see, unlike Jamal, I do not believe that Trust magic is something meant to be cast outwards from its user.
15686 : No, Trust magic is designed to look within us. In other words...
15687 : The alter egos take shape due to the power contained within a kind of unseen pipeline inside of us that conveys our feelings and thoughts to them.
15688 : That got me thinking! If one could somehow boost the amount of those feelings and thoughts being sent...
15689 : It could lead to the alter ego itself becoming even more powerful!
15690 : Hm? What do you mean you don't understand? You really are quite dense, aren't you?
15691 : Well, I am stuck with you, I guess, so you will need a few things if you are to help me with my research.
15692 : First of all, you will need this special diamond.
15693 : It is capable of detecting the feelings and thoughts you direct at the alter ego you are summoning.
15694 : This diamond then stores them within its crystalline confines.
15695 : Once it has gathered a certain amount of thoughts and feelings, it will change color.
15696 : So basically, I need you to use your Trust magic until you see the diamond change color!
15697 : To help you to that end, I have also prepared something else for you.
15698 : I ordered the A.M.A.N. to provide you with a list of Records of Eminence objectives!
15699 : There are three objectives for you to complete. You simply need to complete them all to collect what is necessary!
15700 : Ah, that reminds me. No matter what, you must not lose this diamond.
15701 : It is made from an extremely rare gemstone, so I forced my mother's jewelry shop to let me have it.
15702 : It was originally a rather unusual diamond that changed color whenever it sensed a change in the surrounding temperature.
15703 : I simply used a little magic to make some key improvements and recreate something from a legend I once heard in a faraway land!
15704 : Now then, let us begin the experiment!
15705 : Ah, there you are! I was expecting you much sooner. Hurry up and hand me the diamond already.
15706 : Hmm... Very well done. You have collected just the right amount of thoughts and feelings. Now, for just a touch of magic...
15707 : I-it's a staggering success! The thoughts have been imbued into the diamond!
15708 : Listen carefully. You simply need to use this diamond as a catalyst when invoking your Trust magic.
15709 : When you do, the thoughts sent to your alter ego when it manifests will be made even more powerful.
15710 : That power will then be sent to the alter ego when you attempt to call upon it.
15711 : As a result, the alter ego itself will also become stronger!
15712 : However, there is one thing you need to be careful of.
15713 : The more of these pipelines you use to call forth the alter egos, the weaker the effect of the catalyst will become.
15714 : I can see that your feeble mind is not comprehending what I am saying. Let me see, how can I dumb this down so even you can understand it...
15715 : If your party is made up of you and five alter egos, that means that five pipelines will be used, so each alter ego will only be slightly powered up.
15716 : And if your party contains you and one other member, along with four alter egos, that means there would be four alter ego pipelines and each one will be a little stronger.
15717 : Finally, if there are five in your party along with only one alter ego, that means there is also only one alter ego pipeline, so it will be made considerably stronger.
15718 : Do you understand now? Yes? I am glad to hear it.
15719 : Take note that the catalyst will not be effective unless you yourself are of considerable strength.
15720 : You must be strong if you wish to extract the power from the catalyst.
15721 : Now get out there and experience the fruits of my research for yourself!
15722 : Your alter egos will become more powerful based on the number of members in your party when your item level is 100 or higher. Upgrade details: Alter ego level = avg. item level + number of party members besides alter egos.

15749 : [Lord/Lady] %, please forgive my hasty departure earlier. I have had some time to reflect on my journey here...
15750 : It is about the Emptiness threatening to consume my land.
15751 : I surmise that it is intimately connected to this destructive force that threatens to claim the future, just as Gilgamesh was telling me in Norg.
15752 : The Emptiness will have doubtlessly spread from the Far East, its tendrils stretching ever westward.
15753 : [Lord/Lady] %, forgive me...would that I had been stronger...
15754 : But you know what it means for me to be standing before you here.
15755 : [Lord/Lady] %, you know what it means for me to be standing before you here.
15756 : I must confess to stationing one of my agents around the area after our soiree in Norg.
15757 : It was not for any nefarious purpose, I assure you--it was merely to gather what information I could about the destruction of the future.
15758 : And as I implied earlier, the Emptiness is almost certainly the cause of Iroha's claims.
15759 : [Lord/Lady] %, the Emptiness ceased to encroach when Prishe and her companions toppled Promathia.
15760 : Something horrific must have happened for it to rear its head once more.
15761 : I would ask Iroha to tell me what she knows.
15762 : Forgive me for keeping you waiting, Master.
15763 : Sir Tenzen, the pleasure is mine.
15764 : I am so glad to see you again.
15765 : Again? But this is the first time we...
15766 : Ah, but of course. You mean to say that you have met me in the future.
15767 : You are the very reason I am able to stand here today. My tears flowed like rain when last we parted.
15768 : ...You mean to say that I was swallowed up in the Emptiness.
15769 : Not just you. Everyone.
15770 : I thought myself better prepared for this. So such a future does come to pass.
15771 : Then that means...I failed.
15772 : Sir Tenzen, lift your head.
15773 : In my era, you and the master were revered as heroes of the highest caliber.
15774 : It was not any failure on your behalf. When darkness poured forth from the crystal, there was nothing you could have done to stop it.
15775 : Secluded on that small island, I was unable to stem the rising tide, and the world was torn asunder...
15776 : Heavens be good...
15777 : There is only one thing we can do.
15778 : The question that remains...is why?
15779 : Has some nefarious new force arisen to force open the Gates of Paradise?
15780 : Or is there another threatening to absorb the power of the crystals for its own vile ends?
15781 : Neither you nor Master shared with me the particulars.
15782 : Strife descended upon us in but an instant. Umbral energies radiated from the crystal, and the world was wrapped in gloom before we had a chance to draw breath.
15783 : You mean that we were obliterated into the darkness without knowing why?
15784 : Or was there a reason why we could not tell you?
15785 : I fear the plot will continue to thicken.
15786 : Then there is only one thing to do!
15787 : We must protect our world!
15788 : [Lord/Lady] %, Lady Iroha.
15789 : The future is ours for the taking, and I swear to fight until I have drawn my last breath!
15790 : Wh-what!?
15791 : Does it mean to absorb the fire burning in my heart!?
15792 : No, Sir Tenzen. Your passion has brought new life unto the orb!
15793 : Would that it were sufficient...but the light remains ever pale.
15794 : You have yet to meet with Lady Prishe, correct?
15795 : Master, when you recounted tales of your exploits, Lady Prishe was a prominent figure. You oft waxed lyrical about how her prowess was beyond compare.
15796 : Prishe...? Who is this woman of whom you speak?
15797 : Ah, so the two of you have yet to cross paths.
15798 : This would explain why the orb is scarce as bright as a torch.
15799 : Lady Prishe has but recently arrived in Jeuno.
15800 : Permit me to seek her out and lead her to the port.
15801 : Our next destination is clear to us.
15802 : She is, of course, here in Jeuno.
15803 : Yet I fear for her health. We should first complete our business in Pso'Xja while she recovers.
15804 : [Lord/Lady] %, forgive me my brashness, but I must insist that that should be our first course of action.
15805 : Let us petition for her assistance once she has rejoined us in the world of the living.
15806 : Port Jeuno would seem as good a place as any to reunite.
15807 : Perhaps we should call her back to Jeuno.
15808 : Permit me to seek her out and lead her to the port.
15809 : I would offer to bring her back here to Jeuno myself...
15810 : ...But I need not remind you that the situation is rather complicated.
15811 : Indeed. [Lord/Lady] %, this is where you come in.
15812 : Let us meet back in Port Jeuno once Prishe's hands are free.
15813 : Master, the fire in Sir Tenzen's heart is evident. You must meet with Prishe without delay.
15814 : I must confess that the only reason I am standing here today to aid you...
15815 : ...is that I received a benevolent puissance when you and Sir Tenzen visited me on Reisenjima during the ultimate conflict.
15816 : Yet I must reiterate that I do not exist in this era.
15817 : My presence has caused the wheel of fate to spin, and I fear that it may not come to rest in an advantageous position.
15818 : Yet should you remain ever unflinching as you tackle this most arduous of journeys...
15819 : Then perhaps my appearance here matters not, and you will be able to lead us to a brighter future.
15820 : Master, I shall head to the port while you search for Lady Prishe.
15821 : Please...let me rest here...until we meet Lady Prishe...
15823 : You have entered the crafting target area.
15824 : Crafting the requested items in the current target area will count towards the number of items you are required to deliver them.
15825 : You have left the crafting target area.
15826 : # % remaining.
15827 : I need your help getting me some %. Let's say # more, shall we?
15828 : That's exactly the % I'm looking for. Bring me # more just like it.
15829 : These are exactly the % I'm looking for. Bring me # more just like them.
15830 : Okay, that's all of 'em. Thanks. Be sure to give my regards to your guildmaster.
15831 : Hm? What do you have there, if I may ask? I believe I have laid eyes upon it before somewhere...
15832 : % showed the %.
15833 : I knew it. It's just like one I came across during my studies into dark Trust magic.
15834 : I heard the organization responsible for authorizing the viewing of such materials had hit a wall trying to find a way to decrypt the code...
15835 : Unfortunately, that is the extent of my knowledge regarding the matter. I am sorry that I cannot be of more help to you.
15836 : Oh! You managed to decrypt the code?
15837 : I am surprised to hear that you were able to crack it so easily, especially with all of the trouble the organization had.
15838 : Hehehe. It would appear that your magical aura is worthy of the sense of mystique that accompanies it.
15839 : Huh? Who're you? Wait... You can see me?
15840 : How will you reply? Say you can see him. Pretend not to see him.
15841 : I don't get it... How can ya see me?
15842 : Ah! You must have %. I've got one just like it. My friends tried to stop me, but my curiosity got the better of me.
15843 : It was great at first, losin' myself in a quest for treasure. But before I knew it, I was like a ghost.
15844 : My body remains stuck in the other world, and only my spirit is able to return.
15845 : However, I've got no regrets. It's actually a blast. I've got all this treasure to myself! Hehehe!
15846 : I know how to get there. You might not be able to get there, but I can help show you the way. Whadda ya say?
15847 : Do you want to go? Right away! Maybe some other time...
15848 : I can see you're full of curiosity, just like me! First, you'll need % for your journey. It's a bit different from %, ya see.
15849 : There's something strange about the %, like it's cursed or something. I have a feeling you'll find out soon enough.
15850 : Past, future; light, darkness... Or perhaps something else... The only thing I know for sure is that it won't turn out very good for you.
15851 : So, are ya sure ya wanna go through with this?
15852 : Do you still want to go? More than ever! I'm having second thoughts...
15853 : I can see yer not easily deterred. Well, in that case, you're gonna have to buy % from me.
15854 : Do ya know about the ancient currency used in the realm of men during the Shadowreign Era?
15855 : I'll trade ya for %, %, or %. Come see me when yer ready.
15856 : I'll trade ya for %, %, or %. Come see me when yer ready. I'll give ya the %.
15857 : Ah, I see you've come bearing gifts... Okay, here's the % as promised.
15858 : Now, there are a few conditions for travelin' to this world.
15859 : First...it's dangerous to go it alone. Bring yer friends with ya.
15860 : Ya need at least three people, and ya can take up to eighteen. If there are too few or too many, not everybody'll be able to make it back.
15861 : Second, it's important to get yer rest.
15862 : If you go, you need to rest for at least 60 hours (Earth time) before going again. That'll help ya from endin' up like me.
15863 : Third...this isn't really a condition, but the treasure there is mine. I'm simply askin' ya to bring it back for me.
15864 : Over there, you'll find goodies like this everywhere ya look.
15865 : Aurix shows you %.
15866 : This is a name tag used by the Allied Forces during the Shadowreign Era. It seems they were quite the formidable fightin' unit.
15867 : Ya might also come across something like this from time to time.
15868 : It's a campaign medal that was given to help boost morale amongst beastmen during the Shadowreign Era.
15869 : It appears to have been forged from the name tags used by the Allied Forces.
15870 : You'll find treasures like this everywhere over there. Bring them to me.
15871 : Of course, I'll be sure to reward ya properly. Just bring me that treasure, understood?
15872 : Ah, I see you've been there. I'm glad to see ya back in one piece.
15873 : So, do ya have anythin' fer me? I've made me a list to help facilitate our transactions.
15874 : If ya see anythin' on the list ya want, just bring me the specified goods. And once ya have 100 %, I'll trade ya fer the %.
15875 : So, do ya wanna see the list?
15876 : What will you do? View the list. Ask about Dynamis (D). Ask about time limits with Dynamis (D). Ask about name tags and medals. Ask about Relic Armor. Ask about the word on the street! Never mind.
15877 : You will be able to occupy Dynamis (D) after # hours (Earth time) have passed.
15878 : You can now occupy Dynamis (D).
15879 : You will be able to occupy Dynamis (D) in approximately # minute[/s].
15880 : Also, you can trade 100 % for %, 100 % for %, and 100 % for %.
15881 : I know a good blacksmith. If ya find some armor and the necessary materials, we can pay him a visit.
15882 : I'll update the list for ya. Take a look to see what ya need next.
15883 : Here's the list.

15897 : Okay, ya want the %. Give me a little time and I'll have it ready for ya.
15898 : Sorry, it's not ready yet. Ya need to have a little more patience.

15977 : Not enough jingly? Then you go out, get more jingly, and bring back. Deal?
15978 : In homeland, people put jingly in pouches and give to other people they like!
15979 : You give me jingly, I put in pouch. Then I give you pouch for you to give to friends. Okay?
15980 : But you cannot open pouch yourself. Only friend can. Must be Mysterious Moogle Magic.
15981 : Pouch with jingly! Can use to see how much is inside!
15982 : Here you go!
15983 : Oooh, listen to the happy sound of jingly! But is too much jingly for one pouch. Only up to # jingly.

16000 : tarting player set to [Random/You/Opponent].
16001 : Read the manual? Sure. No thanks.
16002 : Mandragora Mania is a game in which you battle for jingly by moving your mandragora pieces to the goal.
16003 : Your goal is the [red/blue/green] one on the right, while your opponent's is the [blue/green/red] one on the left.
16004 : At the start of the game, three mandragoras each will be placed on the eight game areas, excluding the goal.
16005 : There are five starting placements (A through E), and you are able to select which one you would like to employ. The default setting is "Random."
16006 : This explanation uses pattern A, but the basic rules are the same regardless of the starting pattern.
16007 : The three [red/blue/green] areas in front of you are yours,the three [blue/green/red] areas at the back are your opponent's,and the remaining two are neutral.
16008 : You must choose one area--either yours or a neutral one--to proceed.
16009 : The areas are numbered from one to five starting from the left, and any mandragoras in the area you select will move.
16010 : Conversely, your opponent must select either a neutral area or an area that belongs to them.
16011 : From the right, those areas are numbered 6, 4, 7, 2, and 8.
16012 : For example, if you select Area 1,one mandragora will move to Area 2and one will move to Area 3,and one will move to Area 4.
16013 : Note that the mandragoras will move from the back first--last in, first out.
16014 : You will receive points known as jingly each time one of your mandragoras reaches the goal.
16015 : You will enter your opponent's territory whenever you go past the goal.
16016 : If one of your mandragoras happens to reach the opponent's goal, the goal will be pushed back and your mandragora will return to your own area. You don't have to worry about your mandragora earning any jingly for your opponent.
16017 : The order in which players choose areas will be determined based on your turn settings. The default setting is random.
16018 : This explanation has skipped past your opponent's turn for demonstration purposes, but in the actual game you and your opponent will take turns choosing areas.
16019 : However, if the last mandragora to move reaches the goal, you will get to take an additional turn.
16020 : Mandragoras are a very diverse species, and the amount of jingly you earn is determined by the species of mandragora that crosses into the goal.
16021 : Adenium and citrullus: 3 jingly (first player)/4 jingly (second player).
16022 : Korrigan and pachypodium: 2 jingly (first player)/3 jingly (second player).
16023 : Standard mandragoras: 1 jingly (both players).
16024 : The game is over when either you or your opponent no longer has any mandragoras that can move.
16025 : The player who has the most jingly at that point will be declared the winner.
16026 : The key to victory lies in taking advantage of the various mandragora subspecies bonuses while claiming multiple turns in a row.
16027 : Pattern [A/B/C/D/E] - Your Turn ([First Player/Second Player])

16038 : Really give up? Yes. No.
16039 : ou receive # jingly for a total of #.

16052 : Ungh... It's like every bone in this tired old body is aching...
16053 : And where did all these bruises and scrapes come from anyway?
16054 : Am I sick? Or maybe it's some kind of ancient curse? Wait, I bet I'm being targeted by an evil assassin!
16055 : I know I said something like If you don't need me, then I'll go help someone else! Is that why that greenhorn adventurer's so mad at me?
16056 : Oh, hey there, young'un. Is that a look of concern on your face I see?
16057 : Are you worried about Maat? Yes, actually. No, not really.
16058 : I had a feeling you'd understand my current plight. Yes, you're wise beyond your years.
16059 : It's okay, there's no need to be shy. You can be honest with me.
16060 : At any rate, I'm glad you're here. I could really use your help with something.
16061 : You see, this rather flashy young lady came by recently with a Goblin in tow...
16062 : She was talking about putting on a new show with some Goblins and that she needed to get stronger.
16063 : The price was most definitely right, and she was eager enough. Indeed, she would've made a fabulous student, but that outfit of hers...
16064 : All that fabric fluttering about was quite distracting. I simply suggested she go change, but she immediately replied What's wrong with this outfit!? What else should an idol wear!?
16065 : The heart of a young maiden is a strange thing indeed. Even after all these years, I have yet to understand its many mysteries.
16066 : Hm? Actually, now that I think about it... That was when I started feeling under the weather too.
16067 : Well, I can't say for sure that there is a connection. Anyway, the favor I want to ask you concerns this young lady, you see.
16068 : I need you to find her and return this basket for me. She forgot it in all of the hoopla.
16069 : You should first pay a visit to the junk dealer known as Muckvix in Lower Jeuno. He might know where to find her.
16070 : The Goblin that brought her here was from there, after all. I appreciate your help with this matter.
16071 : Please find the girl that came here to train and give her back this % for me.
16072 : You should speak with Muckvix the junk dealer in Lower Jeuno. He might know something that can help you.
16073 : I want you to find the young lady that came to train with me and return her %.
16074 : Ungh... If these old bones weren't aching so much, I'd go find her myself...
16075 : So, you gave that % back to the young lady? That's a relief.
16076 : Still, ungh... I'm not feeling any better. I tell ya, it's no fun getting old.
16077 : Ungh... It's all rather hazy, but I guess I caused some sort of trouble?
16078 : I'm glad you're able to remember that much, at least.
16079 : Whenever you close your eyes and drift off to sleep, a strange power overtakes you each night. The two of us do what we can to keep it in check...
16080 : Wait just a moment!
16081 : You can't just start saying your lines before I even get here!
16082 : Okay, %! Show Maat the pillow! It's the proof we need!
16083 : Okay, shadow that terrorizes the Batallia Downs each and every night!
16084 : It is time to reveal your true identity! Ullegore!
16085 : Uh-oh!
16086 : Haha! It's okay, I'll handle this!
16087 : Um, miss? This isn't an actual show, you see. We're still holding auditions.
16088 : You're what!? Are you serious!?
16089 : Heh heh... Maat here said he wanted to be a part of the Goblin festival too.
16090 : I guess his performance in the audition was a little too...passionate. We're sorry for all the fuss.
16091 : You can say that again! The Festival of Brave Souls was canceled because of you!
16092 : I don't think you understand just how serious this is!
16093 : Ungh... I don't remember any of that...
16094 : Somehow, I found myself covered in various scrapes and bruises. Maybe that's how I lost my memories?
16095 : Ah!
16096 : Seriously!? You were beaten so badly you lost your memory!?
16097 : Hmph! What kind of person would beat up on an old man like that!?
16098 : Um...
16099 : No, it was all my fault. At least those people I scared can rest easily now.
16100 : Well, I suppose you're right. I hear the Goblins have resumed preparations for their festival as well.
16101 : If you're interested in the festival, miss, you should go speak with the Goblins.
16102 : I'd hurry up before they change their minds.
16103 : Oh, yes, of course! I'll go at once!
16104 : Now then... You there. You look familiar.
16105 : I'm Shami. We've conducted some business together in the past.
16106 : My name is Shami. I trade in rather unusual items back in Port Jeuno with adventurers much like yourself.
16107 : That there is Shemo. We're kind of like what you'd call brothers.
16108 : We both know you quite well. You've made quite the reputation for yourself around here.
16109 : Anyway, in regards to Maat... Everything we told that girl was made up.
16110 : She'd probably feel bad if she knew the truth.
16111 : You see, it was the % she made Maat eat that caused that to happen to him.
16112 : Maat probably mentioned something about her paying him handsomely to help train her, yes?
16113 : That's the problem, you see. Her payment to him was a boiled egg. In fact, I believe it's one you're quite familiar with.
16114 : You mean... The World Eater Egg!? The %!? An initial egg!?
16115 : I'm afraid so!
16116 : Nope, guess again!
16117 : Wow, you're really gonna make me spell it out for you, aren't ya!?
16118 : Anyway...
16119 : Fortunately, the World Eater Egg he ate had deteriorated rather significantly. As such, it probably could've been much, much worse for him.
16120 : You see, while he was awake, he was able to somehow contain the power that radiated from within him.
16121 : But whenever he fell asleep, he transformed into that monster, which you saw for yourself.
16122 : Heh heh heh. Although, thanks to your battle against him, the power of the egg seems to have diminished even further, for now at least.
16123 : You can leave the matter to us. We'll see that the rest of the egg's power is absorbed and sealed away properly.
16124 : The mysterious shadow that's been haunting this place each night shouldn't be a problem any longer.
16125 : Here, this is for your troubles. I have a feeling you'll be needing it before this is all over.
16126 : I've got something from Shami and Shemo that they wanted me to give to you. Here you go.
16127 : After talking to Shami and Shemo, I feel like a great weight has been lifted from these tired shoulders.
16128 : I heard they possess some rather mysterious abilities, but I'm sure glad they were here to help. Heh heh heh.
