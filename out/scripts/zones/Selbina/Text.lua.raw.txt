6665 : I'm a traveling moogle, kupo. I help adventurers in the Outlands access items they have stored in a Mog House elsewhere, kupo.
6666 : This isn't a Mog House, so you can only use the Mog Safe, Change Jobs, and Delivery Box commands, kupo.
6667 : You have to pay fee of # gil to transfer your items to the Outlands, kupo. Why? Because the world is a cold place for rogue moogles, kupo.
6668 : Of course, you can move your items back to your Mog House in town, but if you want to transfer them to the Outlands again, you'll have to pay another fee, kupo. I've got to make a living too, kupo.
6669 : Transfer items? (Current gil:#) Pay # gil. Don't transfer items.

6673 : Greetings adventurer! I'm so glad you've come, kupo! To celebrate the safe recovery of all eleven of King Kupofried's mog tablets, we're offering a limited-time teleportation service for the low, low price of # gil! What do you say?
6674 : Teleport to where? (Cost: # gil.) Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst. Selbina. Mhaura.
6675 : Your wish is my command, kupo! For a small fee of # gil, that is...
6676 : Safe travels, kupo!
6677 : Looks like you're light on funds, kupo... Sorry!
6678 : What's this? You're still new to this land? I'm afraid you're not yet strong enough to handle our potent moogle magic! Just forget I said anything, kupo!
6679 : Oh, what a shame! The mog tablets have been scattered to the winds once more! Without their power, I'm afraid we can't help you, kupo.
6680 : Hello there. Is this your first visit to our fine town?
6681 : Well, is it? Why, yes. No, I come here all the time.
6682 : Yes, I thought as much. You'd best head to the mayor's office.
6683 : Trot down towards the shore and take the first stairway. Turn right, follow the wall, and there it will be.
6684 : Is that a fact? I never forget a face. Oh well. Never mind.
6685 : Have you been to see the mayor? If not, you should!
6686 : Well, well. Nice to see a new face. This your first time to Selbina?
6687 : Oh. I think you should go see the mayor.
6688 : His office is way over on the west side of town, atop the tallest hill.
6689 : Oh. By the way, it's a good idea to show your face to our mayor if you still haven't.
6690 : Welcome to the mayor's residence. How can I help you?
6691 : What would you like to know? About this town. About the shops and services here. Nothing.
6692 : I can tell you much about Selbina.
6693 : Which subject interests you? History. Geography. Industry. That's enough.
6694 : Very well. Selbina was established by Bastok as a haven for ships bearing Gustaberg ore. She soon grew into a thriving port town.
6695 : Selbina declared neutrality at the outbreak of the Great War and maintains her independence to this day.
6696 : Very well. Our fair town lies in the middle of Valkurm Dunes, here in central Quon.
6697 : Most of the coastline consists of dunes and shallows. Selbina stands atop the only suitable harbor.
6698 : Very well. Thanks to the harbor, industry in Selbina has prospered throughout the ages.
6699 : But airships are the wave of the future, so we are trying to develop local industries such as fishing and agriculture.
6700 : Very well. Here we have regional salesrooms of the Fishermen's and Weavers' Guilds, as well as an inn and the sea travel agency.
6701 : You can purchase weapons from Torapiont inside the inn, and local items from Dohdjuma in front of the warehouse.
6702 : Please come back if you have any questions. Good day.
6703 : Another adventurer in Selbina? I don't know where you come from, but you must be quite resourceful to make it this far out.
6704 : These days, folks like you spend every hard-earned gil on shiny new weapons and armor.
6705 : And then they just toss out their old onion-gear as if it were rubbish!
6706 : Why, my father always scolded me whenever I left trash about! Indeed, a true adventurer would not litter, and neither should you!
6707 : That's why I thought of a plan: I'd gather old, worn-out onion equipment and recycle them.
6708 : That's where you come in! Bring me five pieces of onion equipment, and I'll reward you for your efforts.
6709 : Yes, these will do nicely! Take this as a token of my thanks.
6710 : Remember, never just throw anything away. There is always a use for things!
6711 : Now, once I get these little onions mended and polished, I'll send them off for sale abroad. I'm sure new recruits will find them useful.
6712 : Oh, sorry... I was lost in thought.
6713 : As you've no doubt discovered, this here village owes its life to the fish. Bless their hearts...
6714 : Say, did you hear? Oswald, that traveling merchant... He said he lost a ring out in the harbor some time ago.
6715 : Of course I've heard the news. He said it was so precious to him, his face turned blue!
6716 : Yes...poor chap! It must be at the bottom of the sea by now. I feel awful for him, but he'll never see it again.
6717 : Don't mind me. I have a lot to think about and... Huh? Oh, you've heard about my ring, have you?
6718 : I dropped it near the pier and it just... It was so dear to me. I don't know what to do.
6719 : I'd give anything to get my ring back. Anything! But the ocean has swallowed it forever. It's lost.
6720 : What!? You want me to look for a ring? Oh, my! You ask the impossible.
6721 : Oswald's ring, eh? I'd sure like to help him out, but there's no way I could find a ring on the bottom of the sea.
6722 : Wait! Maybe Zaldon knows something. That old angler's the most knowledgeable man in this here whole village.
6723 : What? You're out to find that ring? That's like finding a needle in a haystack!
6724 : Hmm... Of course, it's not impossible. But I wouldn't get my hopes up too high.
6725 : Listen. Around here, the % often bite. Heck, they'll swallow anything that sparkles.
6726 : There's a chance that one of them gulped the ring down. So, catch as many % as you can, and you just might find it!
6727 : There's no guarantee you'll get it, but what have you got to lose? It beats scouring the bottom of the sea, doesn't it?
6728 : Once you catch %, bring it. I'll cut it open for you.
6729 : Caught one, did you? Well, give me a second here. I'll cut it right open.
6730 : Oh, too bad. No ring in this here fish. You must catch more.
6731 : Well, tug my tail! I never thought you'd find it, but here it is!
6732 : Here you go! That's some fine fishermanship, I must say! Make sure that fool Oswald never drops it again!
6733 : Yes, what is this? Goodness gracious! My ring! You found my precious ring! Thank you! Thank you so much!
6734 : You see, this is an engagement ring. My love dwells in Mhaura, and someday I shall offer this to her.
6735 : How could I forget my promise? This is but a mere token of my thanks, but take it; you've more than earned it!
6736 : Hallo there. Whit dae ye think of ma sheep? Ah uised tae chaise doon wild yins fer their wuil, but nou ah've got sheep of ma ain!
6737 : Asides, ye need healthy sheep tae get quality wuil! An ah anlie want the verra best!
6738 : Tha's why ah stairted raisin sheep masel!
6739 : Ma family minds the shop fer me, sae ah can stay oot here an watch ower ma sheep.
6740 : But gettin quality wuil is awfie haird!
6741 : Sae ah'm ettlin tae stuff them wi the verra best feed!
6742 : Tha's why ah need yer help, [laddie/lass]. Would ye mind fetchin me some feed fer ma sheep?
6743 : Well? Of course. Sorry, but I can't.
6744 : Ye will? Tha's a [braw lad/good lass]! Ah'm needin many different sorts of them, an some mair than ithers. Listen cannily!
6745 : Ah need five %.
6746 : Alsae, ah could uise three %.
6747 : Lastly, ah could uise jist one %. Mind an caw cannie!
6748 : Braw wirk, [lad/lassie]. Ye've brought me these %, have ye? Here, take this wi ma thanks!
6749 : Ma sheep are aye in need of quality feed. Anytime ye find some, bring it ower, an ah'll take it right awa.
6750 : Och, ye forgot whit sortay feed ah'm needin, did ye? Well, here it is agane, sae listen cannily!
6751 : Naebody's ivver telt me nae! Got ower muckle oan yer hauns, have ye? Come back aroon anytime. Ah'll be right here.
6752 : I'm Abelard, mayor of this village. It's so tiny, you see, that all I do is mediate when there are disagreements.
6753 : In my spare time I research the life of Gwynham, the man who charted the maps we all carry today.
6754 : He was an adventurer, like you. His travels took him far and wide, and slowly he fleshed out his maps.
6755 : One day I discovered that stone monuments bearing his words lie in various places all over the world.
6756 : It seems each monument carries a different quote. I'd love to rush out there and see them all, but it's tough at my age.
6757 : Say, maybe you could help me gather his words! Well, what do you say?
6758 : What a relief! Well, there's no time to lose! Let's get you started on one close by.
6759 : Take this clay to the monument in West Ronfaure, and press it firmly upon the inscription. Then, bring it back so I can print a copy for my collection.
6760 : Nobody seems to know exactly where to find the monument, so I suppose it might be difficult to find. Take care!
6761 : Is that right? Well, that's too bad. Come back if you ever have a change of heart.
6762 : At last! You've done it! You have my warmest thanks. Here, this is a reward for your effort. Don't expect too much from this old man, though, hehe.
6763 : Ah, you're back! This isn't the one I asked for, but beggars can't be choosers! Here, it's not much, but take this.
6764 : Well? Do you want to bring back another one for me?
6765 : Actually, I don't know where the others are. You'll have to find them and make the impressions yourself. Good luck, and take care!
6766 : Hello again! How's it going? Got the guts to go out and search for monuments yet? Sometimes they're a cakewalk, you know. What do you say?
6767 : What? How could you lose a big piece of clay!? Here, I'll give you another one. Now, take care!
6768 : Oh, I'm sorry, my friend, but I've already got this one, so try getting me a different one. Take care, now.
6769 : You don't know where to go next, eh? Well, I still don't have an impression from the monument in [West Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/La Theine/Valkurm/Jugner Forest/Batallia/North Gustaberg/South Gustaberg/Konschtat], you know.
6770 : You don't know where to go next, eh? Well, I still don't have an impression from the monument in [Pashhow/Rolanberry/West Sarutabaruta/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Buburimu/Meriphataud/Sauromugue], you know.
6771 : You're back! And with the last one! Thank you so much, my friend. In return for your unwavering kindness, I give you this.
6772 : Well, it's good to see you again! My research is going quite well, thanks to you. I hope that map's been useful.
6773 : Yeah? Who the heck are you? If you wanna be somebody, get some more experience under your belt!
6774 : We work the docks, loading the ships with cargo. You know, ships can't sail without food and water, but they take up precious cargo space.
6775 : So, long ago one sea dog had an idea. He figured that % are loaded with water and nutrition. He could kill two birds with one stone.
6776 : The thing was, regular % didn't work! He needed the ones crawlers like to hoard in their nests. The more aged, the better!
6777 : If you ever get your hands on some %, bring them on back to me here. And the older they are, the more I'll pay!
6778 : Hey, thanks a lot. Bring me all you find; there's more gil where that came from!
6779 : I'm a little short on gil at the moment. I'll buy your % once my wages come in...
6780 : Hello, how have you been? Haven't seen you for some time.
6781 : Me? Yes, I'm doing fine, thanks. But my girlfriend's just not feeling well at all.
6782 : I don't think she's sick, so I'm just having her eat nutritious things and hoping she starts feeling better soon.
6783 : I asked the cook at the inn for some help. He said he'd need some special ingredients, but there's no way I could get them!
6784 : You helped me out so much before, so maybe you could do just one more favor for me.
6785 : Thank you very much. He wanted %.
6786 : They say they're really hard to come by. Take care, and best of luck to you.
6787 : Is that a fact? I wonder who could have the time to help me...
6788 : Say, this is %! You found it. You really found it! Thank you so much! Now he can start on that dish!
6789 : This is all I have to give. Please, take it. You're our savior!
6790 : Oh, hello there. Thanks for helping me out then. My girlfriend was very grateful.
6791 : But she still isn't back to her old self. So, I started thinking some more...
6792 : I thought that maybe the real culprit is food itself! Once you eat something, it's gone, right?
6793 : And that's when I came up with this great idea for my next present...but I'll need a little help getting it.
6794 : Well, what do you say? Could I call upon you for yet another favor?
6795 : Oh, I see. But I really would prefer you! If you ever find the time to help me, please come back.
6796 : I know I might seem stubborn, but you're my only hope.
6797 : I heard about how you found the ring. You caught so many fish, and finally you found it inside one of them, right?
6798 : Well, since you're such a fine fisherman, I wanted to ask you to find % for me.
6799 : They say that % yield pearls. If I find one, I'm planning on having a boneworker fix it up for me.
6800 : Then I could give my girlfriend a fine pearl necklace. Well, don't you think she'd like it?
6801 : But without %, I can't even begin. I wish I knew where they could be caught. If I knew someone who could tell me.
6802 : I have a feeling you'll figure something out. Please, do what you can.
6803 : Now what? You're looking for %? Don't you have anything better to do?
6804 : I hear you can find % in sandy places like Valkurm and Buburimu. Heck, get a chocobo to dig some up on the coast.
6805 : Lemme guess. You want to get some pearls from the %, right? Well, it takes time, but it's a lot cheaper than buying them.
6806 : Goodness, you found one! Thank you so much! Here, this is for you.
6807 : You're so fantastic! My girlfriend and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
6808 : Oh, hello again. Thanks for all you've done. My girlfriend was quite impressed with the necklace! The thing is, she said something rather odd.
6809 : She said, Thanks for the gift, but what I want the most is you here next to me.
6810 : I didn't know what to say. Nobody's ever said such things to me!
6811 : Thanks to you, I feel like I've learned what's really important.
6812 : Now I know that she's the one. Thank you so much for all the help!
6813 : Oh, hello again. I can't believe I ever lost that ring. I won't let that happen again.
6814 : These days we traveling merchants fight for our survival. But we can't just give up our livelihood. After all, things weren't always like this.
6815 : I've been all over Vana'diel, but the inn here is my favorite. It's not the most luxurious place in the world, but I love the relaxed atmosphere.
6816 : I hear about you a lot. People say you do much for Selbina.
6817 : I speak for the whole town when I say thank you. Thank you.
6818 : Thing is, the turtlebacks are on the move. Word is they're up to no good.
6819 : I'm itching to go smash them, but I can't leave the town defenseless.
6820 : Maybe you could go instead. What do you say?
6821 : Thanks. The turtlebacks often strike merchants headed to our village. Another caravan was attacked just the other day.
6822 : They fled, but two of them were taken prisoner.
6823 : The turtlebacks prowling outside came from Beadeaux. We think the merchants are held captive there.
6824 : Their names are Evrard and Serafin.
6825 : They say that the turtlebacks keep prisoners locked up tight. Somewhere in Beadeaux there should be such a place.
6826 : The merchants who made it here said that they were different from other turtlebacks. I hope that helps.
6827 : I hate asking others to do our job, but please, rescue the two captives. Their families need them.
6828 : Oh? Pity... I hoped you would say yes.
6829 : W-we're saved! I thought they were going to kill us! Thank you!
6830 : Please, take our things back to Selbina for us. We can run well enough on our own.
6831 : We're so glad you came. As long as you carry our packs for us, we can watch the enemy as we make our way to safety.
6832 : Once back in Selbina, give our packs to Thunder Hawk. He'll make sure we get them. Thank you, brave one!
6833 : Ah, perfect! We just arrived as well.
6834 : Whew, I'm so glad we're free! We owe our lives to you!
6835 : We're thankful enough you're safe. We apologize we couldn't help you.
6836 : But you did well. Thank you! This is for your service.
6837 : You saved our lives, friend! Let us thank you as well. Here, take this!
6838 : Oh, it's you again. There is nothing more I can teach you. Now go, and may Altana smile upon you.
6839 : What? Oh... Hello, child. I'm just a feeble old man. Go and leave me be.
6840 : So, little [boy/girl], you want to be an adventurer, do you? Well, you've got a long way to go, I reckon.
6841 : I am glad that you seek my wisdom, child, but still you are too callow.
6842 : I, too, once took up arms for honor and country. But it was all in vain.
6843 : I helped defend the nation. I tasted glory. But behind their smiles people grew jealous. I lost my family, and my comrades deserted me.
6844 : Soon I realized that all I did, everything I fought for was in vain. I left the ranks for good.
6845 : But of late the beastmen rise in challenge. Again, many may lose dear friends and family to the storms of war.
6846 : I thought then of preventing such tragedy from happening again. Fortunately, an answer came to me.
6847 : I decided to teach my survival techniques to brave youths like yourself.
6848 : If you wish to learn them, you must prove your worthiness to me.
6849 : Are you ready? You bet. Not now.
6850 : Very well. First, bring me %. I shall wait here.
6851 : % would be fine, too...if you can find one.
6852 : I see.
6853 : Well? Have you found %?
6854 : Yes, this will do. I next desire %.
6855 : Well done! Now for your final test. Bring me %. Then you will gain what you desire.
6856 : Splendid. As promised, I will now instruct you in a most precious skill. I call it a support job. Listen well to learn its secrets.
6857 : Support jobs are undertaken anywhere you normally change jobs. And you must already be proficient in a job before you can declare it your support job.
6858 : Furthermore, the effective level of your support job can never exceed half that of your main job. Also, since it is merely a support job, you'll never advance through experience.
6859 : I shall give an example. Let us say you have attained level 20 as a warrior and level 10 as a white mage. You would obviously declare your main job warrior, and your support job white mage.
6860 : In this example, you fight as a warrior of 20 levels and as a white mage 10 levels lower. Thus, you would be performing both jobs to their maximum potential.
6861 : In contrast, if you had declared white mage your main job and warrior your support job, things would be very different!
6862 : Since you would have only 10 levels of experience as a white mage, your potential as a warrior would be reduced to half that of your main job. Thus, 5! Not a wise decision, is it?
6863 : Similarly, you wouldn't want to make your support job something you've never done before. If your support job level is less than half that of your main job, your undeveloped skills would make not a difference. Remember this well!
6864 : I recommend you choose a support job that covers your main job's weaknesses, or one that enhances its strengths.
6865 : I realize there is much to remember, my pupil.
6866 : Do you understand all that I have told you? Yes, I'm ready to go. Once more, please.
6867 : Very good. Now, try your hand at a support job. You'll find it helpful in your journeys, I'm sure.
6868 : You can now designate a support job.
6869 : Hey [mister/lady], I know a quick and easy way to make money, but you can't handle it yet.
6870 : Hey [mister/lady], you got some spare time? I know the road to easy money! Want to give it a try?
6871 : Interested? Yeah, so far. No way.
6872 : Aw, give me the cold shoulder, will you? Well, you'll change your mind sooner or later, heheh.
6873 : That's the spirit! You've just got to prove yourself, that's all. Find some loot I hid in Davoi, bring it to me, and you win.
6874 : But that's not all, [big shot/sweetheart]. You'll get cold, hard cash! You can pick how much time you think you'll need to do the job.
6875 : You'll have pockets full o' gil if you bring it back before the time's up. If not...well, then you don't get jack! Simple, ain't it?
6876 : You want more spending money, right? Come on, give it a try! You can't afford not to!
6877 : Give it a try? I'm game. I'll pass, thanks.
6878 : Okay, whatever. But you'll never make the big time with that attitude. Prudes like you should stick to sellin' % to make ends meet.
6879 : That's the spirit! Life's nothin' but a game of chance, right? Here's the rules.
6880 : You gotta bring me %, hidden inside an urn in Davoi. And I ain't tellin' ya which one.
6881 : But here's a hint: It's in an urn all by itself, not one that's bunched up with others. Eh, you'll figure it out once you get there.
6882 : Bets start at 100 gil! It goes 100, 250, 500, and the big 1000. Then choose a deadline of 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 hours.
6883 : And, the shorter the time, the bigger the payoff. You'll get triple if you make it back in 24 hours, but 72 only yields one and one-fifth.
6884 : I'll bet... 100 gil. 250 gil. 500 gil. 1000 gil. 5000 gil. I'll pass.
6885 : I'll be back in 24 hours for triple payout. 36 hours for 2.5 times payout. 48 hours for double payout. 60 hours for 1.5 times payout. 72 hours for 1.2 times payout. Cancel
6886 : So, you're betting me # gil that you'll be back here in # hours to hand me %. So what are you waitin' for? Get movin'!
6887 : The clock's tickin'! I told you, comb Davoi for % in an urn somewhere. You got # hours left. Hey, I can chat all day if you want...
6888 : Look what we got here! You made it in time! Congrats, the money's yours! Don't spend it all in one place.
6889 : Aw, too bad, hehe! You're late, [pal/sweetheart], so the money's mine. Of course, you can always give it another shot.
6890 : Hey! No IOU's! Pay up or stop wastin' my time.
6891 : You don't have enough gil.
6892 : Improper choice.
6893 : What, you fish, too? Yeah, I thought you knew a thing or two about fishin'. I can tell just by looking at you.
6894 : You're probably at that point where fishing really gets fun. Lemme fill you in on a little something:
6895 : Some fish got bad eating habits. You know, like the one that swallowed the ring?
6896 : Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. Bring me some fish like that. I'll gut it and check its innards for ya.
6897 : If I find something, it's yours. Either way, I'll buy the fish off you, but I can't pay as much as any fancy-shmancy store does.
6898 : It's up to you. You want cash, go to the guild. But if you want to chase your dreams, come see me!
6899 : Stop by once in a while. I'll tell you what kind of fish you can catch.
6900 : Try %, %, %, and %. They're all fish that like to gulp stuff down. Someone of your skill could easily catch one.
6901 : Someone of your skill could catch %, %, %, %, and %. They all like to gulp stuff down.
6902 : Try % and %. They're all fish that someone like you could catch. They love to gulp stuff down.
6903 : And don't forget these: %, %, %, and %.
6904 : And don't forget these: %, %, %, %, %, and %.
6905 : You caught one, eh? Hold on a minute, I'll gut it and see.
6906 : Hmm... Nope, nothing in here. Keep trying, [pal/lady]. I'm sure you'll get lucky soon.
6907 : Look what this bugger had in his belly! %! Here's the money for the fish, and here's your %. Good work!
6908 : What? I'm busy. Can't this wait till later?
6909 : What's all this? I didn't order anything.
6910 : Who made this? It was Rycharde. I'm not sure.
6911 : What? Rycharde made this? Nothing of his is worth eating! Oh, why not? Just a taste...
6912 : What is this garbage!? It's hardly edible! I knew he couldn't cook!
6913 : Tell him something for me. Tell him he should give up cooking for good!
6914 : Well, I won't take anything until I know who sent it. Tell me!
6915 : What now? I've nothing to say to you. Good day!
6916 : You again! What is it this time? I'd rather die than eat any more of his grub!
6917 : What? You want me to cook something? I'm sure you're up to no good, but as a chef I can't turn you down.
6918 : Fine, then! I'll prepare your little dish, but first you must bring me the ingredients I require.
6919 : I'll need % and %. Now, make haste!
6920 : Where are those ingredients? I cannot start without them!
6921 : Hmph. So you found them, did you? Fine! Come see me tomorrow. It should be ready by then.
6922 : What now? It's not done yet! Don't worry, my dishes are always ready on time.
6923 : Done! Now, take it and get out of here!
6924 : What now? It's done, so leave me in peace!
6925 : Oh, you again. I hope you liked the dish.
6926 : What, you again? Well, I'm not about to chastise you. Very well, I'll have a look. Give me a moment.
6927 : It's true he has improved. But still he fails to grasp the basics of cooking. There's more to it than haggling over ingredients!
6928 : Everything has a foundation, not just cooking. Making things good on the outside is easy; it is what's inside that counts.
6929 : Only when one has understood the basics can they make the inside good. Amateurs hurry the most; too often they focus on appearance.
6930 : Rycharde is the perfect example. He simply isn't the prodigy I hoped for.
6931 : He may be my son, but he'll never be a chef in my eyes. Well, that's a lecture not meant for you.
6932 : Are you heading back now? Please, give this to him. Tell him it's my reply. If he doesn't understand what it means, then that will be it.
6933 : You gave it to him, did you not? I do hope he understood.
6934 : You gave it to him, did you not? Back when I started teaching him how to cook, I often had him use % in his dishes.
6935 : % come cheaply of late. But that doesn't rule them out as ingredients.
6936 : You could also use pricey ingredients, and even though your utensils might be mediocre, your food will still come out tasting fine.
6937 : Delicious food is not made from fancy spices or cutlery. Nor does it come from any methodical analysis.
6938 : Indeed, nothing is more crucial than the desire to satisfy others with good food, and thinking up ways to do it.
6939 : If my son could only realize that, there may still be some hope for him.
6940 : Cooking is a complex art, but the basics are as clear as day. I suppose that goes for just about anything.
6941 : Never forget to give thanks at each meal. The hands of many work hard to bring us sustenance.
6942 : Hello there. I'm Mathilde, and my daddy runs this guild shop.
6943 : We only sell goods he hand-picks himself. So rest easy knowing you're getting quality merchandise every time you shop!
6944 : Why, hello. My daughter and I are holding the fort again. Oh, that husband of mine's always out watching his precious sheep.
6945 : My daughter Mathilde married about five years ago. She gave us a grandson, and he's such a good little boy!
6946 : I always tell my husband how lucky we are!
6947 : But you see, Mathilde is adopted. Everyone says we get along better than most real families, though.
6948 : My husband found her out on a trade route when she was just a child, and brought her back home with him. I can't believe twenty years could go by so quickly!
6949 : The thing is, she had no memory of her past. She couldn't even remember her name. She didn't seem hurt anywhere, so she must have been through some terrible ordeal. Poor little thing...
6950 : My husband thinks her family was preyed upon by monsters, and she was the only survivor. The whole world was at war then, and such tragedies were commonplace.
6951 : She still remembers nothing about those times. Nothing, except for a certain boy's name. He must have been a very important person to her.
6952 : Hello again. We have lots of fine things in today. Take your time!
6953 : I'm home!
6954 : Hi, Aldo.
6955 : Mom, look! I found this on the beach. It's for you!
6956 : What a pretty seashell! Thank you.
6957 : Ashtia's waiting for me. Gotta go!
6958 : Take care!
6959 : Always do!
6960 : I'll get one for you too, Grandma!
6961 : Why thanks, Aldo. That would be nice.
6962 : He comes and goes like a cyclone, that boy!
6963 : My little treasure, that Aldo. Where could my other precious Aldo be? He could be out there somewhere...
6964 : No, he must be out there. He's leading a happy life somewhere. Look at us: we live so far apart under the very same sky.
6965 : Good to see you. Once you reach my age, you'll realize that you have to work or you'll never get out of bed.
6966 : You've met Aldo, haven't you? Isn't he such a nice little boy? I always tell my husband how blessed we are for both a child and a grandchild!
6967 : You want something? I've been a fisherman here since the dawn of time! Of course, I have a little side-business, too.
6968 : If you want to learn about fishing, just ask Gabwaleid. He doesn't look it, but he knows quite a bit. I taught him everything! Haha!
6969 : What can I do for you? I'm Gabwaleid. Someday I want to be a real fisherman like Zaldon.
6970 : You have to pick the right bait depending on what fish you want to catch. Otherwise it's all a waste!
6971 : You have to be aware of the time of day and the weather, too. Try to fish at the best time and under the best weather.
6972 : You'll catch different fish depending on where you are. Of course, there's a big difference between fishing from the river and from the sea.
6973 : Oh, and one more thing... It hardly ever happens, but once in a while something...unexpected may bite. Be careful!
6974 : There's nothing better than fishing from the ship. There are so many unique things to catch. The time just flies!
6975 : There's nothing wrong with bait, but I go for lures, myself. You can keep using them till your line breaks or your pole snaps. Of course, they cost more.
6976 : Say, have you heard? Pirates roam the seas between Selbina and Mhaura. You watch out. One never knows when they'll strike next!
6977 : Orcs to the north, turtlebacks to the south... With the ocean now swarming with corsairs, our village is the only haven!
6978 : Been to Jeuno yet? They say that none may question the worth of a man who's walked to Jeuno.
6979 : We work the docks. Trade ships couldn't sail without us, but I guess we'd starve without them, too.
6980 : Keep a sharp eye out for pirates. Word is they strike using uncanny powers. They say it's the truth, believe it or not.
6981 : I hear many Humes in Bastok look down on us Galka.
6982 : Nobody is like that here in Selbina. Here, race is no issue. All that matters is an open mind.
6983 : Our town is equally far from all the great nations. You can go to Bastok, you can go to San d'Oria--all roads are just as risky.
6984 : My husband's out fishing. Lots of good fish bite here.
6985 : We're playing hide-and-go-seek. I wonder where the other three are...
6986 : Oh, you found me first! I knew this would be a bad hiding place.
6987 : Whoa, you scared me! Please, don't tell them I'm here!
6988 : I'd hide further back, but there's a scary man there. I'm so afraid they'll find me here!
6989 : Ha! He'll never find me here! Oh, wait... He is really good at finding us...
6990 : This is the mayor's mansion. Our mayor is a good man. Go inside and say hello.
6991 : The Valkurm Dunes is Selbina's territory, but our militia is too few to patrol it. It is sad, but you adventurers must keep the sands safe.
6992 : Oh, you again. Thanks for all you've done for us. We need all the help we can get.
6993 : No reports of trouble recently. For us, no news is good news!
6994 : Our village may be small, but so many stop here to rest on the road between Bastok and San d'Oria.
6995 : Sorry, the station is for militia personnel only.
6996 : If you're heading outside, remember that there's safety in numbers. Gather people of different talents to cover any weaknesses.
6997 : If you're here for the ship, the docks are straight down the stairs from here.
6998 : I'm Velema. I keep watch over the docks.
6999 : Is there a problem? See the mayor if you have any questions.
7000 : Visitors often ask me how to find the mines of Palborough. What could they want from its dark and twisting tunnels?
7001 : Have you visited the mayor's office yet? That Naillina knows so much about everything!
7002 : I've noticed an awfully suspicious-looking fellow visit town recently. Have you seen him?
7003 : Isacio used to be a knight a long time ago. I wonder what brought him here...
7004 : Zaldon has all kinds of tales to tell. But he's so stubborn your head will ache!
7005 : Gabwaleid actually knows a lot about fishing. He'll teach you whatever you need to know.
7006 : The inn's cook, Valgeir, whips up some fantastic dishes. I wish I had enough money to try one!
7007 : Mayor Abelard is more like a scientist than a politician. He's into some kind of research.
7008 : Vuntar's an earnest worker. Come to think of it, he's been working here as long as I can remember...
7009 : Melyon is so proud of his sheep, isn't he? He's thought up interesting names for them.
7010 : Romeo is always thinking up new ways to make money. And I think he's pretty good at it, too.
7011 : My name's Manfried and I'm a deputy along with Flandiace. Velema's our sergeant, and the three of us serve under Thunder Hawk.
7012 : Hello!
7013 : Welcome to the Shepherd's Muster.
7014 : Herminia carries a wide selection of goods, and Torapiont is always available for your weaponry needs.
7015 : This inn's got the best menu anywhere, thanks to the master chef. He's been cooking for ages, and I doubt anyone comes close.
7016 : The ship to Mhaura's almost here.
7017 : Attention, passengers! The ship to Mhaura is here and ready to board!
7018 : Attention, passengers! The ship is about to depart. Please make haste!
7019 : All aboard!
7020 : You'll have to wait a while for the next boat.
7021 : This ship is bound for Mhaura.
7022 : Entering port (750 Frames)
7023 : The ship is full.

7031 : Please stand by for the next ship to Mhaura.
7032 : The ship to Mhaura is approaching.
7033 : The ship to Mhaura has arrived. Passengers, please board.
7034 : The ship to Mhaura is departing. All passengers, please board immediately.
7035 : This is the entrance. Please inquire at the opposite counter if you wish to leave.
7036 : Lucia can help you if you'd like a ticket.
7037 : Hey, I'm just a guard. Talk to Lucia, okay?
7038 : Hey, nobody leaves until Catus says so.
7039 : Would you like to see a chart of the sea route?
7040 : Check the sea route? Yes, please. No, thanks.
7041 : Here you are.
7042 : Hello there. What can I do for you?
7043 : Arm yourself before you step outside.
7044 : I'm Dohdjuma, and I sell all kinds of things.
7045 : Welcome to the Weavers' Guild salesroom.
7046 : Welcome to the Fishermen's Guild salesroom.
7047 : In need of otherworldly protection?
7048 : I have items for those who delve in the black arts!
7049 : In the market for spells, hexes, and incantations? Well, you've come to the right place!
7050 : Outside is the village of Selbina. Will you be exiting?
7051 : Leave the docks? Sure. Not right now.
7052 : As you wish. Thank you for sailing with us!

7272 : Welcome to the Shepherd's Muster.
7273 : ...You're looking for someone? A Galka staying at this inn?
7274 : Well, if that's the case, he's standing right behind you.
7275 : ...Whaddayawant!? I'm busy! Who on Vana'diel are you? Never seen ya before!
7276 : What!? You came from the Tenshodo!? You're makin' a scene! Step outside already!
7277 : Out here is better. Whatcha got there? Show me that %.
7278 : Well, ain't this amusing. I'm on the straight and narrow these days, so I could just sign it for ya. But that wouldn't be any fun now, would it?
7279 : Let me see. You're still a young thief, but how good are ya? You can't get by in this world on thieving alone, ya know!
7280 : Could ya steal % from those turtle guys in Beadeaux? Those turtle guys gang up on ya and ya can't just pull a snatch and grab job!
7281 : Show me how good you young thieves are these days! Steal me % from the turtle guys in Beadeaux, an' I'll sign ya paper.
7282 : ...You poor adventurer, being made to steal % from those horrid Beadeaux Quadav.
7283 : Welcome to the Shepherd's Muster.
7284 : What an amazing display of thievery! This is the first time I've even laid eyes on %. I don't know what to say... It's incredible.
7285 : ...You're looking for someone again? A Galka staying at this inn?
7286 : Well, if that's the case, he's standing right behind you.
7287 : Good for you, stripling! Those turtles pack quite a punch, huh?
7288 : Here, take this back. I signed the % for ya. Enjoy your thievin' days, %!
7289 : The ship bound for Mhaura will [arrive/depart] in [less than an hour/about 1 hour/about 2 hours/about 3 hours/about 4 hours/about 5 hours/about 6 hours/about 7 hours] (# [minute/minutes] in Earth time).
7290 : The ship bound for Mhaura is now [arriving/departing]!
7291 : Oh, that's right! I forgot to give you this. My memory must be failing me!
7292 : What, you want me to dress a big fish you caught? You make it sound huge. Well, let's have a look!
7293 : Goodness! This is a big one! I can't wait to see what's in here. Give me just a moment...
7294 : Well, well! I found % inside! They're in poor shape, but I think they're quite a find!
7295 : I've been waiting for you. I heard from one of my sources that you were going to be on that boat from Mhaura.
7296 : Now, what did you find? You saw an evil spirit, didn't you? Hmm? There was no treasure? But that can't be...
7297 : But there was. Look at this.
7298 : You... You're the guy who told me to wait here...
7299 : Our adventurer here may not have realized it, but there was a piece of paper in the torn rags of the spirit [he/she] defeated. The men on our boat found that memo.
7300 : This piece of paper is addressed to you. It's your grandfather's will. The spirit that % fought with was...the ghost of Mitsunari.
7301 : It can't be!
7302 : Even though you were not my true grandson, you were always eager to continue in my line of work. I am proud to have someone who appreciated what I did, and I am happy to leave to you all of my knowledge.
7303 : However, as death approaches me, I have come to realize that maybe it is not my knowledge that is important, but my memories.
7304 : Wait. This is it? What is he trying to say?
7305 : I know. To pass on their memories...that is what drives a parent.
7306 : Who are you...
7307 : I am Yomi's husband. Many years ago, she met your grandfather here in this very town.
7308 : Someone to pass their memories on to? I've got my hands full with my ninja training. I don't have time for anyone else.
7309 : Yomi... You may not know now, but one day you'll understand who that someone is...
7310 : She remembered those words the day she accepted the mission to find Mitsunari's lost treasure.
7311 : By that time she was already carrying our daughter, Ayame.
7312 : I think I finally understand what old Mitsunari was trying to say...
7313 : I am not ashamed of what I have done. I am ready to pass my memories on to someone special...our child.
7314 : Not the memories of the skills I have acquired, but the memories of the way of life I have lived--the way of the ninja.
7315 : I want those memories to live on in your heart...
7316 : Those who are obsessed in mastering their skills often lose sight of the reason they first began walking down that path.
7317 : Mitsunari wanted you to know that. That is why his spirit remained at sea.
7318 : Grandfather...
7319 : Awww, just like a page out of a romance novel... You sure have nerve showing your face here, Ensetsu.
7320 : I-I apologize if...
7321 : Ha! When are you going to stop acting like a frightened puppy and turn into a real man?
7322 : Oh, and you. For your troubles, you can have Mitsunari's %.
7323 : Leodarion asked me to give it to you before he left.
7324 : And now we're back to where we started... So long, %. I have a feeling I'll be seeing you again soon.
7325 : You cannot carry the %. Sort your items and try again.
7326 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
7327 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.
7328 : Now close your eyes...

7334 : Do we have a mannequin!? What do you think we are, crazy? Because that's what you'd have to be to have one of those cursed things in your shop!
7335 : Don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about. Beastmen, [young boy/young girl]. Beastmen! I'd keep your whipper-snapping hands off those evil dolls unless you want to be robbed or kidnapped...or worse.
7336 : Why? Because my grandfather told me, that's why! You wouldn't be calling my grandfather a liar now, would you?
7337 : Wait a minute... If you really want to learn more about those goddessforsaken contraptions, I think I might have something that can help you.
7338 : Here, take this catalog. Oh, don't worry about reimbursing me. Even pictures of those mannequins give me the chills. I'm just glad to have them out of my sight!
7339 : You want to make one!? Well, it's your funeral. I heard they were made of wood, so there might be someone in San d'Oria that could help you. But that's all you'll get out of me.
7340 : Hello? Can I help you...?
7341 : Your name wouldn't be Emeline, by any chance?
7342 : My name is Ulmia. We were in the choir together, do you remember...?
7343 : ...?
7344 : I'm sorry, I don't remember much about my childhood.
7345 : But I'm sure you must be mistaken. My name is Mathilde. I work here at the Weavers' Guild.
7346 : ... Yes, you're right, I must be mistaken. Please accept my apologies.
7347 : You so resemble a girl that used to sing in the choir with me, I just...
7348 : You don't happen to have a younger brother, do you?
7349 : A younger brother... Why, yes, I did have a younger brother, only... We were separated in the war.
7350 : But I believe he is still out there...somewhere... I do hope he is happy...
7351 : I am sorry to have brought up this painful subject. I'll be on my way...
7352 : I have one last request for you.
7353 : There is a certain song that you might know. Will you sing it for us?
7354 : A...song?
7355 : I am sure you have this song locked somewhere in your heart. Please try to remember.
7356 : The Tavnazian Cathedral... Cardinal Mildaurion... A song known as the Lay of the Immortals...
7357 : The fifth verse...
7358 : And so the legend ends...
7359 : ...began......crystal......
7360 : ... Was that some kind of spell...?
7361 : The Mimeo Mirror is a device known by any self-respecting rogue. It was finally returned to me.
7362 : Ulmia, are you able to sing the verse we just heard?
7363 : But, I...!
7364 : You do have a penchant for expecting the worst, dear Ulmia.
7365 : There may not be a need for that melody at all.
7366 : I...!? Why would that be?
7367 : Once Lord Bahamut sees Prishe's magicite, it may be enough to convince him. And...
7368 : And we would not want to lose the Star of Tavnazia...
7369 : ...? What do you mean?
7370 : ... There is something I would like to ask Prishe. Ulmia, let us meet with her in Jeuno.
7371 : %, please go on ahead to Bastok.
7373 : I'm Abelard, mayor of this village.
7374 : You say you're looking for Lady Leffine?
7375 : You're not the first to ask that question, but I'm sorry to say there's no one here by that name.
7376 : Even if you've been requested to do so, you shouldn't be poking around into other people's pasts.
7377 : What's that? So why am I trying to find out about Gwynham Ironheart, you ask?
7378 : Sure, I've been doing research into Ironheart's past, but...
7379 : That's not the same thing, [sonny/lass]. I haven't got the slightest interest in his private life.
7380 : I already know all there is to know about him, in any case.
7381 : Have you heard of Lord Torresapet B Ordelle? It was feared he would die a demented death in Ordelle's Caves before he completed the map of those twisted tunnels.
7382 : He gathered the facts about Gwynham Ironheart's life into a single volume. I have the book right there.
7383 : It's just that...  Before that book came into my possession, Gwynham's daughter, Enid, tore out several pages and threw them away.
7384 : I'm curious as to what was written on those pages, but I suppose there's a reason Enid removed them in the first place.
7385 : I guess I should respect that. Besides, I doubt anyone could find them anyway...
7386 : Th-these are the missing pages! Where did you find them!?
7387 : They were left inside Ordelle's Caves...?
7388 : If somebody left these pages on purpose, then we have a duty to read them. Seems that Enid didn't throw them away after all.
7389 : Hm? If I'm going to read these pages, then I should tell you where to find Lady Leffine?
7390 : Fair enough. As did the great Gwynham Ironheart, Lady Leffine passed away many years ago.
7391 : However, her son, Louverance, grew up to become a fine young man. Last I heard, he joined the Royal Knights of San d'Oria.
7392 : I haven't seen him visit his mother's grave lately, though. Has something happened to him, I wonder.
7393 : Speaking of which, there's another thing that's been bugging me.
7394 : Earlier, I had another visitor looking for Louverance.
7395 : It was a young Hume lady. Made some mention of Atarefaunet's Band.
7396 : In any case, she left Selbina after discovering Lady Leffine was no longer with us.
7397 : Is that all you wanted to know? Now if you don't mind, I'll get to reading these pages you retrieved.
7398 : A girl by the name of Sanctia? Yes, I seem to recall a young lady blowing into town quite a while back, and then blowing straight back out. You've missed her, I'm afraid.
7399 : Didn't I tell you this already? It was a young Hume girl that mentioned Atarefaunet's Band, remember?
7400 : She said she was looking for some bounty hunter that had crossed that group of merciless cutthroats.
7401 : Talk around town says that Louverance was searching for the very same man...
7402 : She wanted to meet with someone that lived here a long time ago.
7403 : Seems she meant to ask him about some bounty hunter he was looking for...
7404 : Hm? The young lady was determined to find her way to the Tavnazian Archipelago? And you think she went to one of the caves in the Valkurm Dunes?
7405 : We've had a warning from a high-ranking Jeunoan official not to go anywhere near the vortex in that cave.
7406 : Rumors say that travelers drawn into its depths are never heard from again. You might be too late to save your friend.
7407 : Did the young lady really go into that cave in the Valkurm Dunes?
7408 : She's either extremely brave or extremely foolish to try and reach Tavnazia through that vortex.
7409 : I've got me a painting on the way from an artist named Angelica.
7410 : She's pretty well known among adventurers, so I can't wait to see her work.
7411 : I've really gone and landed myself in it this time...
7412 : I've got to... No, I can't. This is awful!
7413 : Oh, sorry. I didn't see you there. I was just thinking.
7414 : Hey, would you happen to be an adventurer?
7415 : I knew it!
7416 : If you have a moment, could you listen to what I have to say?
7417 : Listen to Diederik's problems? Sure. I'm busy right now.
7418 : Oh, thank you! I was starting to get desperate!
7419 : Well, be on with your work, then. Sorry for bothering you!
7420 : I've been working knots in my stomach worrying about this...
7421 : Anyway, I guess I'd better start from the beginning.
7422 : The name's Diederik. I'm currently working as a middleman to fulfill my customers' needs.
7423 : The other day, one of my clients, an old man in Bastok, said he wanted a painting. So I put in an order with a painter from Windurst.
7424 : Her name was...Angelica, I think it was. She seems to be rather well known among adventurers.
7425 : Anyway, I picked up the finished painting and everything seemed to be going fine...
7426 : That is, until my ship was attacked by pirates.
7427 : We were lucky that no one on board was harmed. But afterwards, I couldn't find the painting anywhere.
7428 : I'm supposed to deliver it soon, though, and it puts me in a sweat just thinking about it!
7429 : Not only that, but my client is a cranky old man who'll string me up by the ears if he doesn't get what he wants! I can't face that!
7430 : He's not going to let me off easy after losing his precious painting.
7431 : Even explaining what happened wouldn't do any good with such a sour person.
7432 : That's why I can't go to him. I don't know what I'd say! I was about to go back to Angelica and see if she would redo the painting for me...
7433 : ...but I can't tell her, either! She's so passionate and loves her craft so much, I'm afraid I'd break down if I saw the disappointment on her face when I told her I lost the painting.
7434 : You see, I'm hopeless. I can't carry this burden alone!
7435 : Hey! You're an adventurer, so I bet you know Angelica, don't you?
7436 : You even modeled for one of her paintings? Excellent!
7437 : I bet she would listen to you if you asked her to redo a painting...
7438 : Hey! I just got a brilliant idea! Why don't you go and ask Angelica to redo the painting?
7439 : You just heard why I couldn't go! You're my only option!
7440 : You're her friend, so of course she'll listen to you!
7441 : Not that I have the courage to face that old scrooge alone, either...
7442 : Oh hey, %.
7443 : Hey, %, what are you doing here?
7444 : ...%?
7445 : Greetings, %.
7446 : Oh, it's you, %.
7447 : %, you came here, too?
7448 : Hello, %!
7449 : Hey, it's %!
7450 : Oh, it's %.
7451 : Oh, hi, %!
7452 : Greetings, %.
7453 : Hm? %?
7454 : This a friend of yours?
7455 : Yeah, sometimes [he/she] and I go on adventures together. So what's up? I miss something?
7456 : Of course! % and I are always up for an adventure together! Hey, what were you guys just talking about?
7457 : You might say that. Anyway, what were you just talking about?
7458 : % and I occasionally adventure together. Were you discussing important matters?
7459 : We adventure together sometimes. What were you two talking about just now? Sounded serious...
7460 : Yeah, we're sort of like adventuring partners. Did I butt in on an important discussion?
7461 : Yes, we sometimes adventure together. Anyway, is something up?
7462 : Yeah! We like to go on adventures together! Hey, what were you guys talking about a second ago?
7463 : Yes, % and I occasionally adventure together. Anyway, what were you just talking about?
7464 : Yep, we sometimes go on adventures together! Um, what were you just talking about?
7465 : % and I occasionally adventure together. Were you discussing important matters?
7466 : % and I occasionally journey together. It appears I interrupted your conversation. Carry on.
7467 : Well, actually, I'm in a bit of a fix. I'd appreciate it if you could hear me out, too.
7468 : Losing the painting on top of getting attacked by pirates? That's rough.
7469 : You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? What bad luck!
7470 : So you lost the painting to pirates. Hm, not your lucky day.
7471 : I see. You must have been disappointed to lose the painting to pirates.
7472 : Pirates attacked your ship, and took your painting? Oh no!
7473 : Having the painting taken by pirates like that... I can't imagine how frustrated you must have felt.
7474 : You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? That's not good.
7475 : You got attacked by pirates and lost the painting? Oh, that's too bad!
7476 : So you lost the painting to pirates. Lady Luck smiles upon you not.
7477 : You got attacked by pirates? And lost the painting? I'm sooo sorry!
7478 : I see. You must have been disappointed to lose the painting to pirates.
7479 : So the pirates went so far as to single out your painting. It seems you chose the wrong day to be at sea.
7480 : If %'s okay with it, I'd like to go with [him/her].
7481 : If % doesn't mind, I'd also like to help!
7482 : If % doesn't mind, I suppose I should join [him/her].
7483 : I suppose I should accompany % on [his/her] journey.
7484 : I know! How about I go to Windurst with %?
7485 : Hey, how about I go to Windurst, too? I'm sure % won't mind.
7486 : If % doesn't mind, do you think I could come along, too?
7487 : If % doesn't mind, I'd like to come along, too!
7488 : If % doesn't mind, I suppose I should join [him/her].
7489 : Think I could come along too, %?
7490 : I suppose I should accompany % on [his/her] journey.
7491 : I can accompany % on [his/her] journey. [He/She] won't mind.
7492 : Wait a minute. Since there are two of you now, I've got one more thing I wonder if you could do for me.
7493 : I want one of you to earn me time while Angelica is redoing the painting.
7494 : What do you mean by that?
7495 : What's that supposed to mean?
7496 : Meaning?
7497 : Earning time, sir?
7498 : What do you mean?
7499 : How do we do that?
7500 : Hm? What do you mean?
7501 : Earning time, eh? What do you mean?
7502 : Meaning what, exactly?
7503 : Huh? Earning time?
7504 : Earning time, sir?
7505 : Earn you time? Care to elaborate?
7506 : I want you to bring that old crank an empty box...
7507 : And I want you to tell him that it holds the painting, but that he can't open it until you say he can, because the painting is so delicate, you see?
7508 : That scrooge'll believe that the painting is in the box, and we'll have earned enough time to get the real thing!
7509 : When Angelica finishes the painting, we can just exchange it for the empty box, and the old man will be none the wiser!
7510 : That way, I won't have to tell him I lost the painting...
7511 : ...and I can avoid punishment...
7512 : However, I can't do it alone! That's right! I need your help, brave adventurers!
7513 : So you're asking us to deceive a poor old man?
7514 : You've got a lot of nerve, asking us to deceive a poor old man!
7515 : You want us to deceive a fragile old man, eh?
7516 : So you want us to deceive an elderly man.
7517 : You want us to lie to the old man?
7518 : Deceiving a poor old man just isn't my style...
7519 : So you want us to trick a poor old man?
7520 : You mean you want us to trick a poor old man!?
7521 : Hmph. Deceiving a poor old man...
7522 : Eh? You want us to trick a poor old man!
7523 : So you want us to deceive an elderly man.
7524 : Deception goes against my principles...
7525 : You do look like you need help. Okay, we'll do it!
7526 : You're my kind of guy! Let's do it!
7527 : Fine, whatever. We will help.
7528 : It appears to be a necessary sacrifice, though. We will help.
7529 : But, I suppose it can't be helped. We'll do it!
7530 : But, you're trying to do a good thing. So we'll help you.
7531 : Well, you are in a desperate situation. Okay, we'll do it!
7532 : Guess that's just the way it is! We'll help!
7533 : You do need our help, though. Count me in.
7534 : But it looks like there's no way around it... Okay, we'll do it!
7535 : It appears to be a necessary sacrifice, though. We will help.
7536 : But, your circumstance cannot be ignored. We will help you.
7537 : Really? Oh, thank you!
7538 : So, %, which will it be?
7539 : Would you rather go to Angelica to reorder the painting, or would you rather come with me to the old man's place to earn time?
7540 : What will you do? Go to Angelica. Go to the old man with Diederik.
7541 : Well, I guess I'd better go earn you time, then. Good luck, %.
7542 : Time to go earn some time! Later, %!
7543 : I suppose I should go earn time. Later, %.
7544 : I will earn time, then. May luck be with you, %.
7545 : I'll go and buy us some time. Good luck, %!
7546 : Leave the time-earning to me, %. Let's do this!
7547 : I'll go earn you time, then. Good luck, %.
7548 : I'll earn you time! Go get 'em, %!
7549 : I suppose I shall go earn you time, then. Later, %.
7550 : Okay, I'll earn time for you! Bye-bye, %!
7551 : I will earn time, then. May luck be with you, %.
7552 : I will see to the old man. Head to Windurst and do what you can, %.
7553 : Well, I guess I'd better be off to see Angelica, then! Good luck, %!
7554 : I'm off to catch Angelica, then! Later, %!
7555 : I suppose I should go see Angelica, then. Later, %.
7556 : I will go to Angelica, then. May luck be with you, %.
7557 : Okay, guess I'll go see Angelica. Good luck, %!
7558 : It's off to Windurst for me, then. Go earn us some time, %!
7559 : I'll go meet Angelica, then. Good luck, %.
7560 : I'll go talk to Angelica! Go get 'em, %!
7561 : I suppose I shall go speak with Angelica, then. Later, %.
7562 : Okay, I'll go talk to Angelica! Bye-bye, %!
7563 : I will go to Angelica, then. May luck be with you, %.
7564 : I will see to the painter. Head to Bastok and do what you can, %.
7565 : Well then, it's decided. Thanks--this is a big load off my back. Things are starting to look up for me!
7566 : We should be fine, with all three of us working together!
7567 : I'll go get ready now.
7568 : Oh, it's you again. Angelica should be at the hostelry in Windurst.
7569 : Please get her to redo the painting for me!
7570 : Oh, it's you again. The old man's name is Umberto, and you should be able to find him in Bastok.
7571 : If you don't hurry, the delivery date is going to come and go! Now get out there, already!
7572 : Sorry, but you're the only one I can count on. Please find the % for me.
7573 : Back when I used to stock them, my supplier said he got them from the Korroloka Tunnel.
7574 : I've been waiting for you! I've got big news!
7575 : I found the painting that I thought I lost to the pirates!
7576 : I'm so relieved. Now I can just put it in that old man's box and be done with it all.
7577 : Eh? What'd you mean, asking me what I'm going to do with the redone painting? We've found the original, so we don't need it!
7578 : Think you could just hop over to Windurst for me real quick and let Angelica know she doesn't have to redo it?
7579 : I mean, I won't force you or anything...
7580 : But I've got to go pick up that original painting, you know, so it would be really nice of you if you could help me out.
7581 : It's not like I don't want to meet her or anything! Of course not.
7582 : I would be so grateful if you went and told Angelica for me.
7583 : What's wrong? You don't look so good. Run into trouble somewhere?
7584 : What!? Your friend is in trouble?
7585 : So what are you doing standing around here for?
7586 : Go and save your friend!
7587 : Don't you care what happens to your friend? Get out there and be brave!
7588 : Your friend is okay? What a relief!
7589 : Could you hop over to see Angelica and tell her that we don't need her to redo the painting after all?
7590 : She redid the painting already!? Why would she do that?
7591 : Anyway, I guess I'd better go slip the original painting in the box before the old man notices...
7592 : Thanks for all your help.
7593 : I'm sure your good deeds will come back to you someday. I won't forget this!
7594 : So what's your friend up to now?
7595 : If you don't know, maybe you should find out!

7658 : Need an explanation? What is Fish Ranking? Explain the rules. How to register. Viewing results. Awards. No, thanks.
7659 : Fish Ranking is a contest held periodically by the Fishermen's Guild. Participants compete based on a set of defined rules regarding the size and weight of a certain big fish.
7660 : To participate, you must acquire the fish we specified for the contest and bring it here. We won't look over your shoulder to see if you're catching your fish or buying them. That's your personal decision.
7661 : You can only have one fish entered for Fish Ranking at once. You can choose to overwrite your current entry with a new catch, but you won't be able to re-register your previous submission.
7662 : We will announce the results after the submission period ends. The top ten entries will receive a modest award and prize money, as well as a new title.
7663 : Fish are judged based on a set of predetermined rules.
7664 : The rules are simple. All fish are inscribed with their size (Im) and weight (Pz). The contest may be judged based on either number, or even both values added together.
7665 : Depending on the rules, the person who caught the fish with the lowest or the greatest value wins!
7666 : Value is determined by the calculation of points and evaluated based on the contest rules. For example, when the rules designate the smallest fish, the person with the fewest points will win.
7667 : During the submission period, I will inform everyone what criterion we are judging by, so just ask if you're curious!
7668 : If you would like to submit an entry, please trade the fish specified for the contest to me, and I will give it a rough inspection.
7669 : The fish will be registered if I deem it is suitable for the contest. You may only have one fish registered at a time. Registering a second specimen will remove your previous submission from the entry database.
7670 : After you pay the registration fee, I will return your fish to you. All that's left afterwards is to wait for the results.
7671 : To ensure a fair contest, we will label your fish before returning it.
7672 : This will not affect the fish other than disqualifying it from reentry in Fish Ranking. You can still cook the fish, sell it at auction, or use it for quests.
7673 : After the submission period ends, the results will be announced. To view the ranking board, just speak to me.
7674 : Anybody may view the ranking board. You'll especially want to check if you or a friend participated in the last contest. Perhaps one of you will be listed on the board, too!
7675 : The top ten contestants will receive a modest award consisting of prize money from the Fishermen's Guild and a new title.
7676 : In addition, participants in the top twenty will receive % as a souvenir.
7677 : You may only receive your award while the results are being announced, so be sure that you are here on time!

7723 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
7724 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
7725 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
7726 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
7727 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
7728 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
7729 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
7730 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
7731 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
7732 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
7733 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
7734 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
7735 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
7736 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
7737 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
7738 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
7739 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
7740 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
7741 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
7742 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
7743 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
7744 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
7745 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
7746 : Deal, kupo? (Current gil: #). Check storable items. Deal. No deal.
7747 : The % will allow you to store the following items:
7748 : %.
7749 : %.

7752 : Warning! If you lose your % while storing a corresponding item, you will be forever unable to retrieve that item!

7754 : What will you do? Retrieve an item. Confirm storable items. Nothing.

7756 : Retrieve %? Retrieve it. Leave it.
7757 : You retrieve % from the porter moogle's care.
7758 : Kupo? I'm already taking care of that item for you.
7759 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
7760 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
7761 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
7762 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
7763 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
7764 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.

7777 : Hi there! I'm Jillia, tee-hee!
7778 : Oooh, isn't that one of those % things? If you have one of those...it must mean...
7779 : ...Aha, I think I get it now. Anastase sent you, didn't he? See, I'm so smart! Tee-hee.
7780 : You want to...um...record this spot maybe?
7781 : What a dumb question! Of course you do! ...Wait, you don't!?
7782 : What a dumb question! Of course you do! Just touch this sensitive area right here with your % and you're done. Be gentle now, tee-hee!
7783 : How'd it feel? Well, it mustn't have been too bad, because...uh...it looks like you got what you came for.
7784 : I have to watch over this waypoint and whatnot, so come by anytime. I'll take you places you've never even dreamed of going, tee-hee!
7785 : Awww, you mean I have to make a report to Anastase!? That's kind of...not fun.
7786 : I'm, well, supposed to be doing neat investigamatory stuff and whatnot, you know? I don't...er...have the time to go make a report.
7787 : I'm definitely not saying that because the milk here is just to die for or anything, okay? It does go down awful smooth, though. And I hear the wrinkly dried goods look terrible, but taste even better, tee-hee!
7788 : I'm about to...um...make some important headway and stuff into the water crisis Adoulin's facing. No joke.
7789 : Yeah...so tell him my hands are completely full right now.
7790 : This continent has so many interesting fishes, don't you think? I clearly need to investigate this phenomanomonon. That is how you say it, right?
7791 : The Adoulin islands are kind of like an island, but with lots of islands, right? But did you know that means there's lots of water around them!? No wonder we eat so many fish back home! Because fish live in water, tee-hee!
7792 : Ohmygoddessohmygoddessohmygoddess! I never thought I'd stumble upon % here! Thank you from the deepest part of my heart!
7793 : How about I give you this in return? It tickles the throat and leaves you feeling refreshed.
7794 : Ooh-hoo-hoo, is that a pioneer I spy? What can I do for you this fine day?
7795 : Some treats from Adoulin? For me? Tee-hee, this is so wonderful! Nothing like some yum-yums from back home to keep me bright and chipper!
7796 : Anastate wants a little bit of an update? Leave it so him to spoil all the fun. Let's see...
7797 : Well, these cute little fishies around here were just begging to be scooped up so I...? Wait, that's not what I meant! Tee-hee! I meant that things are so wonderful over here that he shouldn't worry his head off about sweet ol' me!

7928 : Tell me, adventurer. What use do you have for a humble seamstress?
7929 : Give her Hostenn's effects? Here you go. No. I want to hold onto them.
7930 : The guild has all manner of wares for sale. Let me know if any pique your interest.
7931 : Well, well, you bring me a most intriguing specimen. You must be quite the accomplished geomancer to have come across such materials and methods.
7932 : And here I thought such techniques had been lost to the ages.
7933 : Don't worry--I have no plans to bombard you with tales of how to cut the cloth, or how my ancestors toiled endless hours to craft even the slightest...
7934 : Oops! Sorry about that. I'll get started right away, although it may take a short while before your piece is complete.
7935 : Sorry to disappoint you, but your garments aren't ready yet.

7941 : I am, and I consider it an honor to be able to work with such ancient, almost-forgotten weaving methods.
7942 : The vibrant blue hue of the cloth...the bottomless depth of directional magic.
7943 : From my apprenticeship to this very day, never have I set needle to pieces of cloth quite like these.
7944 : This % is blessed with the gravitas of nature.
7945 : It also borrows from the power of elementals to harmonize the physical with the magical.
7946 : And this piece is intended for you, Sylvie?
7947 : Me? Oh, no. I would like % to have it.
7948 : Zacariah's will would never have been carried out if not for [him/her].
7949 : I can't think of anyone more suited to don this attire.
7950 : Please, %. Take it as a sign of my thanks.
7951 : Then the matter is settled.

7966 : Three things should suffice: %, %, and %.
7967 : I am led to understand that your skills rival those of the primal geomancer herself, and that you were able to ring her bell in a time of great need.

7982 : What would you like to know? You wanted an adventurer? About this town. About the shops and services here. Nothing.
7983 : Ah, you must be %.
7984 : Thank you for answering the summons. One of the mayor's confidantes has been asking for you.
7985 : I'm Abelard, mayor of this village. It's so tiny, you see, that all I do is mediate when there are disagreements.
7986 : A pira...entrepreneur associate of mine known as Gilgamesh has had your name on his lips the past several days.
7987 : He rescued a young woman adrift at sea, and she spoke quite highly of you when she woke up.
7988 : Finding you has removed one burden off my shoulders, but there remains yet another.
7989 : You see, Gilgamesh made a second request.
7990 : He's looking for % that can be procured from some of the large bees around the Crag of Holla or Crag of Dem.
7991 : Their medicinal properties are highly valued even during times of peace, and what with the recent strange happenings...
7992 : You probably know what I'm going to ask.
7993 : Wrest three % from those buzzing menaces located around either of the two aforementioned crags.

8006 : %, might come as a bit of a surprise to hear this, but I'm a pirate known for roamin' the Bastore Sea.
8007 : The oceans ta the west have been a bit stormier'n usual of late, an' me crew an' I came across a small vessel adrift upon the tides.
8008 : So 'course I say to meself, who'd'a thunk that such a delicate rowboat could stay whole in such a terrible brew...an' then the whole thin' started flashin' red.
8009 : Being the curious sailor I am, I went an' investigated. Lo and behold, there was a pretty young lass lyin' prone along the deck.
8010 : I've always had quite the fondness fer the color red. Figurin' it must be a sign from Altana herself, I took her on board and brought her back with me ta Norg.
8011 : When she came to, the first words from those pale lips of hers were yer name.
8012 : So I want ya ta come back ta Norg with us. She was quite insistent on meetin' ya.
8013 : Ya see, she's gone on a bit of a...hunger strike.
8014 : The ship's docked at port waitin' ta take you whenever ya've got yer affairs in order here.
8015 : I just remembered a bit of a pressin' engagement I've gotta attend to, but I'll catch up with ya there.
8016 : I...I have a request. Don't breathe a word to the populace that I aided a known pirate.
8017 : Their activities aren't completely on the up-and-up, but as a port town, we still depend on them.
8018 : And while we're talking of aid, remember to use that item I gave you.
8019 : Isacio here in town will know what to do with it.
8020 : I'm sure it'll aid you in your travels.
