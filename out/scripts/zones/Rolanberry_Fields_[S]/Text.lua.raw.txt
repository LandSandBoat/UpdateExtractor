6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7201 : I am sorry, but at this time, I cannot be of any assistance in that area.

7204 : Understood. I shall prepare a new set of tags for you now.
7205 : You've already undergone an evaluation for this battle, or had you forgotten? As much as I'd like to, I'm forbidden from providing you with a new set of Allied Taegs until the next battle begins.
7206 : Anyone wearing Allied Tags while participating in a campaign battle will be judged on their overall performance.
7207 : Soldiers will be evaluated not only on their fighting skills, but also on how much they contribute to the efforts of their allies through means such as healing and enhancing.
7208 : However, beware that if you leave the area before being assessed, you will be deemed a deserter and will forfeit all rewards earned that day.
7209 : Also, while there are no immediate penalties for being knocked out, falling in battle will significantly lower the score given to you.

7211 : Allied Tags are a special type of identification given to all participants of Allied Campaign battles.

7213 : However, some of the drawbacks include the inability to improve skills and earn experience points for individual kills, as well as the right to loot fallen enemies.
7214 : Temporary items can be purchased in exchange for Allied Notes.
7215 : There are several different varieties of items, but they all have one thing in common--they can only be used on the battlefield they were issued.
7216 : It is highly recommended that you first survey a battle's conditions and then select the supplies that you believe will benefit you most.
7217 : Please remember that all temporary items you carry on your person will be confiscated in the event that you leave the area.
7218 : You can only purchase temporary items if your nation of allegiance is commanding the campaign.

7231 : Might you be a student of the same field as I? If that is the case, I might be able to provide you with the proper grimoires...at a price, of course.
7232 : Spondulix comes all the way from Boodlix's Emporium to help Tarutaru and Mithra. I can help you, too! You have gil, no?

7413 : Hey, you're in the way. We fortifyin' this here wall to withstand the beastmen's siege turrets. So how's about just gettin' outta here before you get hurt.
7414 : Unless you're willin' to wipe that helpless look off your face and lend us a hand. That'd be a different story.
7415 : Assist with the fortifications? Show them how it's done! Refuse to help. Ask for an explanation.
7416 : Alright! That's the spirit! Let's get a move on, then.
7417 : Hmph, I figured as much by lookin' at you. Beat it, then. This is no place for tourists.
7418 : Like I said, in preparation for an enemy assault, we're workin' to fortify these defensive barriers. If you're willin', I'd like to place you in charge of managin' these here craftsmen as they go about it.
7419 : To be more precise, once you get to each craftsman's position, you have to tell 'em exactly what I'm about to tell you. Namely, what type of crystal they need to be usin'. That's all there is to it.
7420 : The young Elvaan wearin' the red hat is a blacksmith. Make sure he's using fire crystals.
7421 : The adorable little Tarutaru with the blonde braids is laying plaster. Gonna have to get her on some ice crystals.
7422 : The Hume lady is a stonemason, and a darn good one. She's gonna be needin' wind crystals.
7423 : That old coot of an Elvaan with the huge axe strapped across his back is a carpenter. Famous 'round these parts. Make sure you get him workin' with earth crystals.
7424 : May not look it, but the Mithra with the black kerchief wrapped 'round her noggin is an architect. She's gonna need her lightning crystals.
7425 : That sprat of a Tarutaru wearin' the blue getup's a handy lil' plumber. Surin' he'll be wantin' his water crystals, no doubt.
7426 : The good-looking fella in all white does scaffoldin'. Young Hume lad. See to it he's usin' light crystals.
7427 : The lady Elvaan's a painter. Handles a brush like nobody I never seen. Need dark crystals in that line of work. And that's it.
7428 : Ahhh, one more thing. If you're too late issuin' your orders, they're liable to up and leave their posts. So be right, and be quick.
7429 : Choose a crystal! Fire crystal. Ice crystal. Wind crystal. Earth crystal. Lightning crystal. Water crystal. Light crystal. Dark crystal. Plumb give up.
7430 : Hey now, you're runnin' this here operation! You can't just quit! There's no quitting in war!
7431 : Wow... You sure botched that job. All them wrong orders threw the craftsmen off kilter. They're demandin' a new foreman.
7432 : Well, the good news is you're gettin' your orders right. The bad news is that you're takin' your sweet time doing it. We'll never be ready for the Beastmen at this rate.
7433 : Come on, now! You even want to win this war!? The craftsmen are startin' to strike thanks to your incompetence!
7436 : NPC#
7437 : [///]
7438 : Ah, you must be %. We've been expecting you.
7439 : The delivery took you # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7440 : The delivery took you # [minute/minutes] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7441 : While you were dawdling your way here, a separate shipment of construction materials was delivered to us. We shan't be requiring anymore.
7442 : I commend you on your expeditiousness. Thanks to you, the construction work on our provision storehouse here can proceed as planned.
7443 : So you have something to aspire to, the quickest delivery thus far was made by %. That indefatigable soldier traversed the same course as you in just # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7444 : You're the current quickest delivery record holder, with a lightning-fast time of # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time). But that's no excuse to slack off, you hear?
7445 : Time elapsed: # [hour/hours] (Vana'diel time) # [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] (Earth time)
7446 : You find nothing out of the ordinary.
7447 : A shiver runs down your spine...
7448 : Perhaps you should first attend to more pressing matters...
7449 : Something tells you that you should wait a moment and try again.
7450 : I am far too busy to speak with you now. Perhaps I'll have a little time later.
7451 : Good show on your last operation. Now go make an official report to Sir Rasdinice.
7452 : Good work on that last operation. Now report back to First Centurion Hieronymus before he has your hide!
7453 : Nice job on your last operation. Now don't forget to report back to Emhi Tchaoryo!
7454 : It seems that you were not successful in your last operation. But do not let one small failure hang heavy on your soul. Report to Sir Rasdinice and put this all behind you.
7455 : Weren't so lucky during that last operation, were you? Well, don't worry about it too much. Report to First Centurion Hieronymus and get some rest, soldier.
7456 : Hmmm... Didn't do so well on that last operation, did you? I know it's hard, but it's better if you're up-front about these things. If you know what's good for you, you'll hurry down and report to Emhi Tchaoryo before the major finds out first.
7457 : Make haste, %. Sir Rasdinice awaits your report!
7458 : What are you waiting for, %? Report to First Centurion Hieronymus on the double!
7459 : Why are you wasting your time chatting with me? Shouldn't you be reporting to Emhi Tchaoryo?
7460 : Good work, soldier. [The Kingdom/The Republic/The Federation] thanks you for your cooperation.
7461 : I am charged with the provisioning of supplies for our troops out on the battlefield. I can issue you temporary items in exchange for Allied Notes.
7462 : Select a temporary item. (Price) Nothing at this time. Browse another page. %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) Next page. Previous page.

7465 : It appears you're already in possession of one. I'm sorry, but we can only afford to issue supplies to those who are most in need.
7466 : I'm sorry, but we're fresh out of stock for that item.
7467 : You must attain a higher rank if you wish to be issued %.
7468 : Is there anything else you require?
7469 : Let the Blade of the Conqueror once again bring glory to the Kingdom!
7470 : Gwahahaha! Let me cool you off a little before I send you to hell!
7471 : Father! Lend me your strength!
7472 : For the king!
7473 : My spear is lightning...and your scream shall be the thunder which follows my mighty strike!
7474 : Ha hah! Your arrows cannot pierce the iron will of a true knight!
7475 : This arrow to your heart shall be Altana's final judgment.
7476 : Shogyo Mujo! Zesho Meppo! Shometsu Metsui! Jakumetsu Iraku!
7477 : There is no escape...save death!
7478 : Altana! Let your divine light guide us to victory!
7479 : You barbarians will regret the day you set foot on Bastokan soil!
7480 : Ryaaaaaaaaah!
7481 : Men! Do not fear the enemy! It is our blades they shall fear!
7482 : A swift end is the only mercy you will receive from me, fiends!
7483 : Watch carefully, because this is the last thing you'll ever see in this life!
7484 : I never liked fighting on land... Now, give me a well armed battleship on the open sea, and I'll have those turtlebacks running for their lives!
7485 : A soldier always comes prepared! Hehehehe!
7486 : To your seats, boys! The show is about to begin!
7487 : Ahahahaha! My hand slipped!
7488 : This is your last chance. Throw down your weapons and your life will be spared. If you refuse...
7489 : The gates to the underworld have opened! I'll see you on the other side...or not! Wahahahahah!
7490 : There is nothing more magnificent than the dance of flames on the battlefield!
7491 : <Phew!> I think I've had enough of this volume!
7492 : Guttler: Guttler thirsty! Guttler want blood! More blood!
7493 : Time to go to work!
7494 : Invincible! Indestructible! Indubitable! The age of the Cardians is upon us!
7495 : You, over there. No, wait! You're supposed to be on that side! Hold on, which one were you again? Arrrghhh!
7496 : <Snorrre>... Is that the best you can do?
7497 : Petty beastman hordes are nothing compared to giant wildebeests of homeland! I swat you all down like fruit flies!
7498 : <Yawn>... Um... Holy light...show the way...?
7499 : The protection of the throne comes before all else. Only by direct order of the royaulais will I wield my blade on the battlefield. Such is the duty of the Royal Guards.
7500 : Hah hah hah! The ringing of steel upon steel! The dripping stench of the battlefield! What could be better than war? The nobles can have their balls, I'll do my dance on the front lines!
7501 : How dare a baseborn peasant raise [his/her] voice to a noble knight!? Begone, before I strike you down myself!
7502 : The Kingdom's defeat at Jugner still stings. To avenge the souls of those lost on that fateful day, we must join hands and take up arms as one.
7503 : Not once in the four hundred years since the dawn of the Royal Knights has the Kingdom found itself in such peril. Let us take up our pikes and stand our ground to ensure another four centuries of prosperity!
7504 : It is often in times of strife that a man's true nature is revealed. Will you stand tall in the face of fear, or run and cower in the wake of your mother's dress?
7505 : While our holy doctrines specifically prohibit the taking of another life, you need not hesitate on the battlefield. The Church has branded the beastmen enemies of Altana. The purification must begin! It is the will of the Goddess!!!
7506 : After years of training in the Far East, I return only to find my nation burning at the hands of the infernal beastman hordes. The heathens shall pay dearly... My work has only just begun.
7507 : You have the look of a fine warrior. It is a pity you are not one of my Crimson Wolves.
7508 : The eyes of the Goddess are ever upon us. We must remain steadfast against the evils from without, as well as those from within.
7509 : The Republic was formed with the blood and sweat of the people. The flames of freedom must continue to light our furnaces of strength. The waters of civilization must continue to turn our wheels of ingenuity!
7510 : Turtle sleeps in a rocky den 'Cause he's not a citizen Strike him down with sword and stave Stick a blue flag in his grave
7511 : We may have the upper hand in technology and munitions, but the enemy's advantage lies in their sheer numbers. The Allied Campaign will not win in a day, soldier. Make every bullet count.
7512 : The Metalworks' strategies are too timid for my taste. The beastmen are nothing but dominoes, waiting to be toppled. A swift, aggressive assault is the only way to victory.
7513 : Move along, soldier. I have nothing to say to you.
7514 : Halt! If you're not one of the Fourth, then get your sorry tail over to the recruitment office on the double! And if you are one of us, then what the hell are you doing here talking to me!? Get back on the battlefield! About...FACE!
7515 : ...Heavy infantry, five columns of 200... Two 100-knight regiments... Enemy force casualties estimated at 5,000... Oh, I apologize, soldier. I've spent the past few nights preparing for a joint operation with San d'Oria's Royal Knights.
7516 : You look like you've seen better days, soldier. Let me guess, it's the war that's bringing you down. What you need is a little music in your life!
7517 : If it weren't for the Galkan heavy infantry, this nation wouldn't last a month against the turtlebacks. And what thanks do we get? A handful of stale army biscuits!
7518 : Have you ever stopped to ponder what that comet might truly portend? I'd like to believe it is a message of hope--that soon this age of darkness will come to a close...
7519 : Oh, whatever has become of my sweet Windurst? Rabble running through the streets, streets overrun with rabble! Why are you even speaking to me!? Does the title Master Caster no longer garner even an onz of respect!?
7520 : Ah, the Fates have brought you to Gariri the Magnificent! Why am I thus called, you ask? Why, because only I was magnificent enough to decryptify those mysteriously marvelous Near Eastern tomes and open a window to...the Other Side!
7521 : We all wear masks because deep down inside we are nothing but beasts. The question I ask you is, to which do you submit--the mask, or the beast?
7522 : (Guttler! I told you to keep qui--) Ahahahah... Don't mind me, I was just...uh...keeping myself company! (Shhh! If you open your mouth one more ti--) Ahahaha... Uh, were you still there?
7523 : If only the Parliament of Patriarchs would loosen the strings on their purses a little more, I would be outside right now roasting up a couple birdmen to snack on!
7524 : Have fun while you can, filthy mercenary, because before long you'll be back on the streets where you belong--replaced by a quiet, obedient army of Cardians!
7525 : Normally, it is my duty to protect the patriarchs of parliament, but with the fate of Windurst in doubt, I'm forced to lead my loyal pets to the front lines.
7526 : Do you like the headpiece? I made it from my firrrst victim. I wear it to let everrryone know what happens when they cross Mikhe Aryohcha!
7527 : Back in my home, Ulbuka, I hear rumors of great riches in eastern lands. But now I am here, and where are riches? I see nothing but Tarus! Ahahahaha!
7528 : <Yaaawn>... Mastering these Near Eastern magics can be quite taxing. If I had a choice, I'd rather be back in bed, relaxing...
7529 : I saved this one especially for you!
7530 : Hiiiiii-yah!
7531 : My dear pupil, Dalzakk. You still have much to learn...
7532 : Witness the true embodiment of my sorrow.
7533 : Heh heh heh!
7534 : <Giggle>...
7535 : Wheheheheh! You thirsty, Kopeh?
7536 : Come, Kilhwch! We must strike down the evil which stands before us!
7537 : My brothers and sisters! Raise your blades for justice!
7538 : Kilhwch! Silence those fiends!
7539 : To your feet, Kilhwch!
7540 : Lady Ulla. We must retreat.
7541 : How dare you!
7542 : The raven shalt spare nary a tear for thy demise.
7543 : Watch! And see how a real mercenary earrrns her wage!
7544 : Leave me be. The verge of battle is no time for words.
7545 : Fear not. My fists will guide us to victory.
7546 : My daughter awaits her father at home. I will permit no Beastman to delay my return.
7547 : Beyond this point lies the sealed royal tomb of King Ranperre. Tell me, %, do you believe the legends?
7548 : The Orc war machine draws near. We must brace ourselves for battle.
7549 : In former times, this island was inhabited by a ferocious tribe of vikings. It is said they braved vast expanses of open sea to arrive here. Romantic, don't you think?
7550 : Surely you have seen the tigers that roam these downs. They were brought from the northern continent by the Orcs themselves. They are highly prized for their luxurious pelts, though their bloodlust makes them formidable game.
7551 : The brotherhood of this place once welcomed me long ago. I pray that the years have been kind to them.
7552 : The Gold Musketeers of the Republican Army are marshalled by young woman. Such talk is sure to inspire my daughter.
7553 : Bastok was forced to abandon the Palborough Mines following a Beastman invasion. How an army such as the Republic's could permit such an affront baffles me to no end.
7554 : The village elder in La Vaule told me of the so-called wyrm deity of Grauberg. Of course, I am sure it is nothing more than folktales. Still, my curiosity is piqued...
7555 : Strange... I am certain the vegetation of this area is different from when I last visited. Surely I would not have allowed myself to forget such beautiful flowers.
7556 : Such devasation... Even the resilient Goobbue were not able to survive. I wonder if this place shall ever be restored to its former glory...
7557 : History tells us that it was in the year 381 that San d'Oria's iron-tempered  King Lanfeaur R d'Oraguille came these lands to strike a peace with the Quadav. Whatever happened to the bond that was formed...?
7558 : I have seen here two twins who between them share a power for magic the likes of which I have never seen. This is indeed a strange nation.
7559 : Unfortunate... I had always wished to gaze upon the fabled magic towers of West Sarutabaruta with my own eyes. Yet I fear I may be too late...
7560 : This fortress is lauded as the impregnable point of Windurst's defenses. Goddess forbid, should it happen to be taken, Windurst is unlikely to last more than a month's time.
7561 : These windblown sands reak havoc on my throat. I look forward to a cup of my daughter's fine Batallia tea.
7562 : Take heed, %. I have seen Beastman-dug battle trenches throughout these plains. Should you be found, your life is forfeit.
7563 : There is an ominous feeling in the air... This is no place to linger.
7564 : Never have I felt a cold as piercing as this. My teeth chatter and my toes grow numb. We would do well to find a place to warm ourselves.
7565 : I wonder if it was not somewhere near here where minister Francmage was dispatched on the Multinational Expedition some 10 years ago.
7566 : Never did I imagine the day would come that I would set foot in this accursed place. Has great is our foe's desperation? Do not lower your guard, %.
7567 : And so we breach the enemy's inner sanctum. Expect anything, %! And don't die on me!
7568 : As the Allied Forces have long maintained, this citadel would be ideally suited to the defense of Jeuno.
7569 : A well conceived strategy... A stronghold established under the cover of the nest of these vile crawlers. It is almost surely to be overlooked by the enemy.
7570 : Oh, mighty Altana, be the sword in my hand. With you, the swift cannot flee, nor the strong escape. Receive mine enemies, for the mercy of the Goddess embraces even the wicked.
7571 : Heh heh heh! Wonder what technique I should try out on these ol' beastmen chumps.
7572 : Haha... Who will be the next darling recipient of my spells?
7573 : Red blood, blue blood, any colorrr blood. If it bleeds, we can kill it!
7574 : What's taking so long? I'm getting all antsy-wantsy! My pets are I are all bad at staying still...
7575 : Do not fear. Righteousness will prevail. I shall show you victory!
7576 : Promise me one thing. Should anything happen to me... Look after my daughter.
7577 : I reckon I'll be earnin' my keep. Won't be doin' nothin' extra, though. Don't be expectin' me to risk my hide without my due an' proper, mm-hmmm.
7578 : Bravo really is a dear once you get to know him. It's just that in the heat of battle he... Well, you'll see.
7579 : My blade, Kyomon, anticipates much beastman blood. This battle may prove interesting, yet.
7580 : Look to me, mortals! And be haunted for the rest of your brief time in this world!
7581 : For a split second, you thought you saw Titania turn and shoot you a tiny smile.
7582 : The flower atop Babban Ny Mheillea's head appears to be in full bloom!
7583 : Ribbit! Ribbit!
7584 : You'd better watch your back!
7585 : Don't take this personally, but I've got children to feed.
7586 : Time to have some fun!
7587 : Reckon it's time tuh earn my keep, mm-hmm.
7588 : Come now, Bravo! It's high time we taught these beasts what a wyvern is truly capable of!
7589 : Hehe, so many willing to be sacrificed!
7590 : Hmph. Perhaps I should just burn the eyes of these infidels with my true form.
7591 : I fear not death, for the Goddess awaits us with open arms.
7592 : It is not yet your time.
7593 : Be strong, for the Goddess is with you, always.
7594 : Return to the dust whence you came! Randgrith!!!
7595 : Saints and heroes...glory and despair... Of these I shall sing unto my dying breath.
7596 : When work has ended stay not late. Return to where thy dearest awaits.
7597 : O gentle Goddess of the Dawn, thou brighten the black of night. Hear our song and heed our call, and bathe us in your delight.
7598 : Press forward valiant soldiers, glory draws nearer still. Thy deeds shall resound forever, by my stirring song fulfilled.
7599 : Loyal children of Altana, arise and be sustained. Be nourished in thine undying faith, and bask in victory's refrain.
7600 : Sing! Dance! Laugh, and cry! Let sweat rain down in floods! Ride upon this rhythmic beat, make seethe thy red life blood!
7601 : Dance thine elegant, airy steps that has won a thousand hearts. Enchant, enthrall, and captivate, treat none with disregard.

7720 : These humble berries also warm the hearts of carnivorous beastmen, and guards have been posted against Goblin thieves and Yagudo raiders.
7721 : The most valuable berries are stockpiled by insects, who use a special secretion to store them. This results in an exceptionally tart preserve, popular with connoisseurs.
7722 : The village of Jeuno has benefited greatly from the harvests here, and the bounty of the sea. They seem well on their way to statehood.   --Gwynham Ironheart, 757 Crystal Era.

7798 : Are you ordering me to return to ranks? Eh, I guess I have no choice...
7799 : It's about time!
7800 : Don't you think some of us should have stayed at the checkpoint? What if the beastmen attack?
7801 : I'm worried about the soldiers back at the garrison. I have to see if they are all right!
7802 : Erm... But what about the soldiers at the stronghold? Maybe they're being attacked, too? Oh, what should I do?
7803 : Understood, [sir/ma'am]. I guess the garrison will be alright...
7804 : We're finally here... I sure hope nothing happened at the checkpoint...
7805 : Where's the enemy? I'll take out a whole battalion with one hand tied behind my back!
7806 : Huh!? Was that an enemy scout!?

7810 : Welcome, %.
7811 : You have # more [minute/minutes] (Earth time) to complete this mission.
7812 : The reinforcements have lost their way...
7813 : About time you showed up, soldier. This here's the shipment of materials you'll be transporting.
7814 : I suspect you've already been briefed, but this is some volatile, dangerous stuff. But you signed up for this mission, so we're counting on you to deliver it to the stronghold before its power dissipates.
7815 : You'd best deliver that to the stronghold while it still packs some oomph.
7816 : What's this? Whatever power was in this is long gone. No, this won't do at all.
7817 : Ahhh, so you're military tactician who who drew up the plans for this latest supply mission. Why don't we ask one of the men how its going, shall we?
7818 : You are the tactician responsible for our latest operation? Then I shall report in on the status of our mission up until now.
7819 : As per orders, the supply caravan completed preparation of our cargo last night, and set out on the designated route at daybreak.
7820 : Unfortunately, we encountered an accident and lost a portion of our cargo.
7821 : Most regrettably, we encountered an accident and lost out entire load of cargo.
7822 : We encountered considerable beastman opposition. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
7823 : We encountered a superior beastman assault force. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
7824 : We encountered a beastman supply convoy, who was also made immediately aware of our presence. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
7825 : We encountered a substantial force under the direct command of a beastman general. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
7826 : By the good graces of the Goddess, our convoy was able to emerge victorious over our adversaries.
7827 : By the good graces of the Goddess, our convoy was able to obliterate the beastman supply contingent. In addition, we seized a significant portion of the enemy's supplies.
7828 : However, despite our best efforts, our convoy was utterly defeated. All of our cargo was lost to the enemy horde.
7829 : By the good graces of the Goddess, we narrowly succeeded in throwing the beastmen ranks into chaos and disarray.
7830 : By the good graces of the Goddess, we somehow staved off the beastman attack and shook free. However, we were forced to abandon a portion of our cargo in the process.
7831 : However, we were unable to repel the beastman's relentless pursuit, and in the end our convoy was scattered. All of our cargo was lost to the enemy horde.
7832 : I am pleased to report that our unit was able to reach this stronghold safely with all of the intended cargo. The success of our mission was due in no small part to your brilliant planning.
7833 : Our unit was able to reach this stronghold safely with the cargo. Your planning may well have been the decisive factor in the success of our mission.
7834 : Our unit was able to reach this stronghold, though we did so bearing a great deal less than the intended cargo.
7835 : Supplies abandoned by the Beastmen can be seen be strewn about. However, there is nothing that could be put to any use.
7836 : The marshlands beyond this garrison stretch for malms. The uneven terrain and ever-changing weather make it the perfect location for those slimy turtlebacks' headquarters. Take care when passing through, soldier.
7837 : I don't see your stripes. You're not a member of the allied forces, are you?
7838 : If it's work you're looking for, why not stop by the Republican stronghold in the Crawlers' Nest?
7839 : The legion has been using those caves as a weapons cache. I'm sure they could use an extra hand.
7840 : Oh, wait! Forget what I said. The nest was handed over to the Federation a number of weeks ago.
7841 : Though, if you're still interested in joining the Republic, you can travel to the Coveffe Barrows, but that's quite the journey.
7842 : Either way, I suggest that you find a nice, safe place to settle down...and quick. The wilds are no place for civilians these days.
7843 : What the hell are you looking at?
7844 : I don't have time to entertain the likes of you. Get out of my face.
7845 : So you're from [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. What is that to me? I have no interest in your battles. I go where I want, when I want. No one can take that from me. Not you, not some [king/president/sibyl], not anyone.
7846 : Hold on... You haven't happened to hear anything about an Ensetsu, have you? His family's supposed to be living somewhere in Bastok.
7847 : Ah, never mind. Forget you heard anything from me.
7848 : What the hell is this? Do I look like a goldsmith? Get that thing out of my face!
7849 : Hah! You think you can buy my loyalty with a single throwing star!?
7850 : Hmph... I might consider helping out [your kingdom/your republic/your federation], but I won't be making you any promises.
7851 : Lysander! This is a key location in Jeuno's defenses. Don't think you can take it easy when I'm not looking over your shoulder!
7852 : Heh, why don't you go ahead and chase all those beastmen off for me, then?
7853 : Hah! You make it sound a simple task! These are the fiends that bathed Windurst in blood, and crushed the Royal Knights of San d'Oria!
7854 : Don't whimper like a little girl, Carlisle!
7855 : I have faith in your amazing luck on the battlefield!
7856 : Captain Lysander! Look! Another of those monstrosities...!
7857 : So, we have a maw in [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign] now, too...
7858 : How many of these things do we have confirmed?
7859 : Well, sir, there's one in [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign], one in [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign], and now this one in [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign]...
7860 : Alystair. Aren't you forgetting the reports from our allies?
7861 : Ah, you're quite correct, sir!
7862 : Including the three Jeuno has confirmed, there have been nine maws discovered in total, sir.
7863 : Hahaha. You needn't be so formal, son. This isn't the parade ground.
7864 : Still, that's not a small amount, even if they are spread over two continents...
7865 : Could it be the arrival of the Harbinger...?
7866 : You speak of the prophecy, sir?
7867 : Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but something feels wrong to me...
7868 : Rumors in Bastok say these maws are monsters set loose by the beastmen...or maybe even the Kindred.
7869 : They say the same in Windurst.
7870 : We are at war. It's natural for people to jump to conclusions.
7871 : But the truth is, we still have no facts either way.
7872 : We do know these things appeared right at a time when the beastman forces suddenly grew in size. That can't be a coincidence.
7873 : It's certainly worth looking into...
7874 : Is that...a person!?
7875 : This place wouldn't be my first choice for naptime...
7876 : Uh...!
7877 : You're not a Jeunoan soldier... State your name and regiment!
7878 : At ease, Corporal. I don't think [he/she] bites.
7879 : What happened, [man/ma'am]? Did you hit your head, or something?
7880 : Altana only knows what you were doing out here, but you better head to the safety of town.
7881 : Sergeant Barnabas. Civilian entrance to Jeuno is currently restricted...
7882 : Ah, that's right! Then you'll have to settle for the Eldieme Necropolis instead. If you walk straight south of here, you should come across an entrance into one of the more habitable areas.
7883 : Ah, that's right! Then you'll have to settle for the Crawlers' Nest instead. If you walk south of here, you should find the tunnel leading inside.
7884 : Ah, that's right! If you walk straight south of here, you should come across the base the Royal Knights are constructing. What was that fancy Elvaan name for it? Garl--?
7885 : Sergeant!
7886 : Well, be careful wandering around [Batallia Downs/the Rolanberry Fields/Sauromugue Champaign] in any case. It isn't safe.
7887 : It's been converted into a base for allied operations, so it should be a far sight safer than sleeping out here in the wild.
7888 : On your way, civilian.
7889 : Should we return to Jeuno and report, Captain?
7890 : Yes. Archduke Kam'lanaut must be informed of the existence of this new maw.
7891 : GraAaAaaaAAgh!
7892 : % is engulfed by the cavernous maw!
7893 : A disembodied metallic voice drifts towards you...
7894 : You sense the gaze of the cavernous maw upon you.
7895 : When the Harbinger cometh...
7896 : The Champions of the Dawn shall descend...
7897 : Hm? Was that descend or fall...?
7898 : I can never remember the words...
7899 : Well, whatever, whatever. I have more important things to...
7900 : Oh! Oh my stars! This did not happen. Didn't happen.
7901 : How could I have been so blind? I never even noticed someone was here with me. Never noticed.
7902 : Oh, woe is me... I have fallen to the deepest blue depths of depression. Do you see how blue I have become?
7903 : Do you see how blue? Oh yes, completely blue. You seem black and white to me...
7904 : Of course you do! You are a child of Altana, after all!
7905 : But...I thought a child of Altana would sympathize! Be sympathetic, you know?
7906 : Oh!? What's this, what's this!?
7907 : Who knew such a thing was possible!?
7908 : What does this mean? What indeed?
7909 : Could it be? Could it be you possess the same power...?
7910 : The same power as me?
7911 : My whiskers are twitching. They twitch.
7912 : Shall I tell you what this means? Inform you? You possess the power to bend time itself. An ability bestowed only on the worthy.
7913 : Although, it seems you lack the same control that I have.
7914 : Uncontrolled, I would say.
7915 : But this is good news, nonetheless.
7916 : The regal feline peers intently at %.
7917 : My intent, you see, is to help end this war before certain terrible, indelible wounds are gouged into history.
7918 : Despite my best efforts, the nation of Elvaan knights devises pretentious plans that see them fall to the beastmen, time and again.
7919 : The Humes ignore the unrest in their city, while Galkan rage reaches boiling point. The point of boiling!
7920 : The Mithra squabble amongst themselves, and the Tarutaru dither as the Yagudo sack the city of Windurst. Sacking the city, they are!
7921 : To confound matters, the alliance between the nations of Altana is still in its infancy, and old suspicions threaten to sever the tentative bonds. Bonds could be severed!
7922 : There are only so many things I can do with these two small paws.
7923 : ...
7924 : Will you help me with this grand plan of salvation?
7925 : If things are allowed to run their course, this war will spread to consume Vana'diel in a tidal wave of tragedy.
7926 : I hope to shrink this tidal wave of tears, if only by a little. By a few drops.
7927 : It will be difficult, thankless work. Thankless and difficult. But would you be up to the task?
7928 : Are you up to the task? I'll do it! It's not my time...
7929 : I'm sorry, I seem to have misheard you! Heard something amiss!
7930 : I'll just ask you again, shall I? Are you up to the task?
7931 : Wonderful! I feel my depression lifting already.
7932 : The fate of this age rests on your shoulders! So much rests on you!
7933 : Ah, I forgot to mention the Champions of the Dawn.
7934 : It is prophesized that the Champions of the Dawn will appear in an age of strife and save the world from catastrophe.
7935 : A band of heroes? A bevy of maidens? Who knows? Is this the age the prophecy foretells?
7936 : I shall go forth and search for these champions with my mystical whiskers!
7937 : So very busy! Busy indeed...
7938 : Hm? An introduction? Have we not been introduced?
7939 : My name is Cait Sith.
7940 : I am certain we shall meet again in the near future. Or would that be the near past?
7941 : In any case, I wish you luck with your endeavors!
7942 : Luck to you!
7943 : DEBUG: Press the confirm button to continue.
7945 : Babban and her friends continued in their search for the fabled city of Netherstalk...
7946 : ...and came across a sapling by the name of %.
7947 : Would you look at that? Why, that determined young face reminds me of when I was but a wee sapling, uprooting myself for the first time in Netherstalk.
7948 : That's what baby treants look like!? But...why is it covered in that strange husk?
7949 : Strange husk!? That fiber will one day be the little one's sturdy bark!
7950 : Are you certain this is a treant child? Those appendages growing from its head hardly qualify as branches.
7951 : Lady Bryher, those appendages shall soon grow into a glorious crown of leaves!
7952 : And look at the sureness and stability of those roots! [He'll/She'll] be a fine and upright treant, mark my words!
7953 : Fair day to you, my sapling friend! My name is Babban Ny Mheillea.
7954 : %, is it? Nice to meet you!
7955 : My friends and I are searching for the city of Netherstalk.
7956 : And once we get there, the prince and I will fall madly in love.
7957 : We'll have beautiful children--a boy and a girl, of course--and live happily ever after!
7958 : Hm? Do we have any idea where to look?
7959 : Well, our friend Darach was actually born there!
7960 : Unfortunately, it was such a long time ago that he's forgotten the way... But not to worry!
7961 : I know the way...to a wondrous place...not far...from here...
7962 : It has to be Netherstalk! Why don't you come along, %?
7963 : Joined by the sapling %...
7964 : ...the hopeful friends arrived at the wondrous place Abenzio had promised them.
7965 : But, what's this?  Something's not quite right...
7966 : This is the fabled plant city...?
7967 : Yes! I can feel...the moisture...in my moss...
7968 : The moisture!? All this damp will rot my old trunk!
7969 : I can't stay here! I can feel myself starting to bloat!
7970 : What...are you all...complaining about? At least...Babban is...enjoying herself...
7971 : <Blub...blub...blub>...
7972 : Blub...? Oh, my verdurous vines! She's drowning!
7973 : Is this really the city you sprouted in, Darach?
7974 : Harrumph. I seem to recall rather a bit more dazzling sunshine in the city of my youth...
7975 : Sunshine? You never mentioned that before. It was all sparkling water and cool breezes!
7976 : Dazzling sunshine, you say? I know a place just like that! It's on the other side of Gustaberg!
7977 : Then that must be it!
7978 : We'll find Netherstalk for sure this time!
7979 : Taking the advice of the confident Camlin, our intrepid plant pilgrims set off south across the rocky plains of Gustaberg...
7980 : It appears that various roots and vines have been dragged through this area...
7981 : The sandworm swallows you whole!

7993 : Greetings, fair traveler. My people would entreat thy assistance, and offer rich reward in return. Thou shouldst speak with my sister Callisto, who abides in Grauberg's Witchfire Glen.
7994 : Hark! Our foe lurks thither. How wouldst thou proceed?
7995 : How will you proceed? Withdraw. Charge in. Scout the enemy. Check weapon.

8163 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
8164 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
8165 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
8166 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
8167 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
8168 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
8169 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
8170 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
8171 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
8172 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
8173 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
8174 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
8175 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
8176 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
8177 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
8178 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
8179 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
8180 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
8181 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
8182 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
8183 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
8184 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
8185 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
8186 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
8187 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
8188 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
8189 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
8190 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
8191 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
8192 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
8193 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
8194 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
8195 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
8196 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
8197 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
8198 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
8199 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
8200 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
8201 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
8202 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
8203 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
8204 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.

8261 : Greetings and well met. I am a Voidwatch scientist charged with researching the potential uses of atmacite.
8262 : Those who possess % may come to me to have their hard-won atmacite infused. Stratum abyssite also falls within my domain, so present to me any whose properties you wish to have analyzed.
8263 : Ah, I'm also authorized to teleport folk to operation sites. Quite versatile, aren't I?
8264 : I beg of you, friend. Lend us your stout sword arm in the fight to protect Vana'diel from the Voidwalker threat.
8265 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Have stratum abyssite examined. Request teleportation. Analyze atmacite. Ask about atmacite. Ask about atmacite enrichment.
8266 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Infused: % (lv.#) Purge atmacite. Infuse atmacite. Enrich atmacite.

8269 : Infuse % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
8270 : You do not have enough cruor.
8271 : [Infuse/Purge] which atmacite? None for now. % (lv.#) % (lv.#) % (lv.#)
8272 : Purge % (lv.#)? Yes. No.
8273 : % expends # cruor and is now infused with % (lv.#)!
8274 : The atmacite could not be infused...
8275 : % has been purged of the % (lv.#).
8276 : % purges the % (lv.#), infusing % (lv.#) in its place. (Cruor expended: #)
8277 : You do not possess any atmacite capable of enrichment.

8279 : Enriching the % will produce the following:
8280 : Enriching the % from level # to level # requires # cruor.
8281 : Enrich %? Yes. No.
8282 : Your % has been enriched to level #! (Cruor expended: #)
8283 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
8284 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
8285 : The atmacite could not be purged...
8286 : The % (lv.#) bestows the following bonuses:
8287 : Replace % (Lv.#)? Yes. No.
8288 : Atmacite is best described as the crystalline agglomeration of a creature's soul. Our scientists have succeeded in discovering a way to tap its power to serve the efforts of the Voidwatch.
8289 : By infusing one's body with atmacite, it is possible to obtain powers akin to those once possessed by the creature whence it came, rather like turning a beast's fangs upon its own kind.
8290 : At first glance, atmacite appears to be the perfect artificial enhancement. However, it does suffer from a single limitation: its power is unleashed only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
8291 : Research to identify the exact reason for this continues, but most scientists find the spectral alignment theory compelling.
8292 : That is, being formed of Voidwalker souls, atmacite will surge to life only when its bearer is existentially aligned to its dimension of origin.
8293 : From this it can be inferred that Voidwalkers are stripped of considerable strength when they cross over into Vana'diel.
8294 : But I suspect this is of little interest to a layman like you. Allow me to return to the subject at hand.
8295 : The infusion of atmacite requires cruor, a potent energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
8296 : Cruor is obtainable by various means, felling a Voidwalker being the most common of all. As you can never have too much cruor, I urge you to be diligent in its procurement.
8297 : We've recently perfected a method for improving atmacite potency. The process is called enrichment, and involves fusing cruor on to atmacite to amplify its power.
8298 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages up to a maximum of level #. The quantity of cruor required varies with the variety of atmacite as well as its current enrichment level.
8299 : Under normal conditions, atmacite enrichment is an intensive process that demands trained hands. For reasons yet to be determined, however, both infusion and enrichment can be safely performed by laymen, provided they're at a planar rift.
8300 : Keep this in mind should the need arise to reconfigure your atmacite with haste.
8301 : Examine which stratum abyssite? None right now. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
8302 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth.
8303 : The stone shows signs indicative of growth, but the changes are yet too slight for untrained eyes to discern.
8304 : Oh my, such a magnificent display of evolution! Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired!
8305 : Why yes, this stone is showing the initial signs of evolution. It appears there's still room for growth, however.
8306 : Hmmm... I fear this stone's growth has been interrupted. Were you to find a catalyst of sorts, perhaps it could still evolve further?
8307 : Hmmm... I'm afraid the stone isn't exhibiting any signs of growth. Perhaps a catalyst of sorts could help to spur along the process?
8308 : How curious. I've not seen a stone like this before. Wherever did you find it?
8309 : Your % has evolved into %!
8310 : Supply me with the # cruor necessary, and I shall gladly teleport you to an operation site of your choosing.

9045 : I am a Voidwatch officer dispatched here by the [Grand Duchy of Jeuno/Allied Forces of Altana]. My duty is to recruit able-bodied soldiers to assist in repelling the Voidwalker threat.
9046 : I beseech you, friend. Lend your aid to our cause, lest our fair Vana'diel be engulfed in fire and brimstone.
9047 : What will you do? Nothing for now. Ask a bunch of questions. Participate in Voidwatch Ops. Request debriefing. Request %. Check voidstone stock. Request reward issuance.
9048 : While I commend your enthusiasm, only those who possess % may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
9049 : The % is considered proof of one's valor and prowess, and is awarded only to those who have distinguished themselves in the three nations.
9050 : Enlisted in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s armed forces, you say? Hmm... There appears to be no record of your service there.
9051 : I'm sorry, but only those with military affiliation may participate in Voidwatch Ops.
9052 : While your enthusiasm is heartening, the Voidwatch requires men and women of tested steel. Come back again once you have proven your worth.
9053 : You must be at least level # to participate in Voidwatch.
9054 : Have a mind to lend us your aid? Splendid!
9055 : I see you've yet to be issued %. Here, take this and keep it on your person at all times.
9056 : Stratum abyssite is needed to do battle with a Voidwalker at one of the many planar rifts that have manifested across the land.
9057 : You can't simply use one wherever you like, mind you, for each stone is attuned only to rifts found in a certain region, or jurisdiction.
9058 : Undertaking a Voidwatch operation in a specific jurisdiction requires that you obtain the corresponding stone from the presiding Voidwatch officer.
9059 : While these stones are capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to their bearers, their powers can only be tapped when used in conjunction with %.
9060 : Operations are presently underway at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
9061 : Operations are presently underway at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
9062 : Operations are presently underway at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. While planar rifts have been reported in other areas, we've yet to discover how to engage Voidwalkers there.
9063 : It would seem some other requirement exists besides the usual % and %.
9064 : Rest assured, you will be apprised of this information as soon as we acquire it.
9065 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet].
9066 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/the Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg].
9067 : At this time, we request your participation in the operation at [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo].
9068 : When you engage in battle with a Voidwalker, you do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension. The rules of such engagements are unlike any other, and I counsel you to proceed prepared and with all caution.
9069 : Now, go and do Vana'diel proud!
9070 : Ah, there's one thing that should be of interest to you.
9071 : The % you possess--our researchers have discovered a most intriguing property about it.
9072 : You see, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
9073 : Absorbing this energy causes the abyssite to evolve, or more accurately, makes it attuned to other planar rifts. This, of course, translates to an expanded sphere of Voidwatch Ops in which the bearer may participate.
9074 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [East Ronfaure/East Ronfaure/Ordelle's Caves/the Jugner Forest/the Jugner Forest/King Ranperre's Tomb/West Ronfaure/La Theine Plateau/Vunkerl Inlet]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
9075 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [North Gustaberg/North Gustaberg/the Gusgen Mines/the Pashhow Marshlands/the Pashhow Marshlands/Dangruf Wadi/South Gustaberg/Konschtat Highlands/Grauberg]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
9076 : [Operations are set to commence at/Operations are currently underway at] [West Sarutabaruta/West Sarutabaruta/the Maze of Shakhrami/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Meriphataud Mountains/the Outer Horutoto Ruins/East Sarutabaruta/Tahrongi Canyon/Fort Karugo-Narugo]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
9077 : Operations are currently underway [in the greater Jeuno region/in the three nations]. Your presence there would be of tremendous aid to our efforts.
9078 : Ah, I daresay your % has undergone change!
9079 : How many would you like? None. Just one. Fill me up!
9080 : Here is your additional % allocation. Make each and every one count, you hear?
9081 : It appears you already possess the maximum allocation of # stones. I'm not authorized to provision you with more.
9082 : I'm afraid we're out of stock. The next shipment is expected to arrive in # [minute/minutes] (Earth time).
9083 : Obtained key item: # %!
9084 : Obtained key item: # %!
9085 : Your outstanding allocation of %? My records tell me you have # to your name.
9086 : Exchange for what? (Cruor: #) Nothing right now. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #. %: #.

9088 : # cruor is required for the %.
9089 : Proceed? (Required Cruor: #) Yes. No.
9090 : It seems you do not have enough cruor.
9091 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for %!
9092 : % hands over # cruor in exchange for the %!
9093 : Hm? It seems you already possess %. In that case, you won't be needing another.
9094 : This periapt allows the bearer to infuse an additional atmacite for each one possessed.
9095 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against weapon skills and abilities.
9096 : This periapt grants the bearer heightened insight into Voidwalker weaknesses against magic.
9097 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of guidance.
9098 : This periapt enhances the effect granted by a periapt of percipience.
9099 : A bewitching light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if beckoning its bearer to come hither.
9100 : A tantalizing light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if appealing to its bearer's most ardent desires.
9101 : A crazed light shines forth from within the crystallized walls of this fragment ripped from a Voidwalker, as if seeking to breach the bearer's last bastion of sanity.
9102 : What will you ask about? Nothing. The Voidwalker threat. How I can do my part. The Voidwatch. Voidwatchers. Ascent items. Riftworn pyxides. %. Stratum abyssite. Planar rifts. Cruor. Abyssite. Voidstone consumption.
9103 : Voidwalker is the name given to creatures that roam the realm between worlds.
9104 : Little is known about them at this time, except that they're driven by an insatiable lust for destruction.
9105 : While reports of Voidwalker encounters vary greatly in content, one thing is certain: the creatures are gaining in strength, a mounting threat that cannot be left unchecked.
9106 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning adventurers to lend their aid.
9107 : As the nature of Voidwalker battles renders full-scale military operations unfeasible, we have chosen to stake our success on the mobility and versatility of adventurers.
9108 : In our effort to neutralize the Voidwalker menace, the Voidwatch is petitioning soldiers of the Allied Forces to lend their aid.
9109 : To be sure, there're those who question the wisdom of thinning our ranks in the face of the Shadow Lord's armies. But I assure you, friend, the Voidwalker threat is no less real.
9110 : Our scouts regularly bring back intel on locations of suspected Voidwalker presence.
9111 : Armed with this information, we dispatch strike teams to preemptively neutralize the threat.
9112 : Ordinarily, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought. Only by using the voidstone's power can we force them to feel the sting of our steel.
9113 : These magicked stones are distributed in regular shipments from our Jeuno-based research team. They're the bare minimum we need to have a fighting chance against the enemy.
9114 : Voidstones work by realigning your existential spectrum to match that of Voidwalkers, thus rendering the creatures visible to you.
9115 : The stones are highly prized, such is the difficulty of their creation. As such, supplies are limited to # stones per person at any given time.
9116 : That's provided we have any in stock at all. Much time is required in imbuing them with requisite powers.
9117 : The Voidwatch is an organization that exists for the sole purpose of protecting the world from extradimensional invaders we call Voidwalkers.
9118 : Recognizing the graveness of this threat, the nations of the Middle Lands joined together in common cause and formed the Voidwatch.
9119 : Helming the organization is the Grand Duchy of Jeuno, with the remaining three nations contributing resources for its operation.
9120 : Possession of % is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
9121 : It can be earned only through loyal service to your nation, and thus serves as a testimonial for your prowess.
9122 : You would do well to obtain one if you haven't already done so.
9123 : Affiliation with the Allied Forces of Altana is a requirement for participating in Voidwatch Ops.
9124 : In other words, you must belong to the armed forces of one of the three nations.
9125 : The enlistment procedure varies depending on nation. Those wishing to obtain a recommendation letter should pay visit to one of the military encampments surrounding Jeuno.
9126 : When you battle a Voidwalker, you must do so as a Voidwatcher--a defender of the dimension who has harnessed the powers of the voidstone and stratum abyssite.
9127 : Bereft of these two objects, Voidwalkers cannot be seen, let alone fought.
9128 : However, there are a few points all budding Voidwatchers should bear in mind.
9129 : Most crucial of all, the extradimensional nature of being a Voidwatcher renders you isolated and unable to receive help from the outside world.
9130 : Scientists attribute this to the dimensional misalignment that occurs. As people are ordinarily unable to see Voidwalkers, so too are they unable to see you.
9131 : But you needn't concern yourself with the hows and whys of such matters. It would behoove you far more to become familiar with the workings of the existential spectrum.
9132 : You see, each dimension is composed of an existential spectrum to which all things within are aligned. In turn, the spectrum is formed of five lights: blue, red, yellow, green, and white.
9133 : The alignment of these lights between Voidwalker and Voidwatcher plays an important role in our efforts.
9134 : To elaborate, the act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning ourselves to its existential spectrum.
9135 : Now, while Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with these creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
9136 : Compensating measures, however, have been developed to allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe.
9137 : One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items, while another entails performing certain actions against the enemy.
9138 : Both methods aim to manipulate the alignment value of individual lights to various ends.
9139 : All five lights influence the contents of the treasure chest which appears at the successful end of battle.
9140 : Our researchers have succeeded in determining what manner of benefits are associated with each light.
9141 : For instance, improving blue spectral alignment is known to produce greater quantities of spoils.
9142 : In contrast, manipulating red spectral alignment reportedly enhances the quality of individual items--potions becoming hi-potions, and so forth.
9143 : Yellow and green, on the other hand, influence experience gain and cruor yield respectively.
9144 : If you wish to know more about the curious red substance we call cruor, you need but ask.
9145 : Lastly, we have white spectral alignment, which is unique even in this company. It has been determined to affect the appearance of transdimensional objects such as atmacite and periapt.
9146 : Research regarding these artifacts is still ongoing.
9147 : Lastly, be reassured that there're no known negative effects of manipulating spectral alignment. We unreservedly encourage all Voidwatch operatives to endeavor towards maximum alignment.
9148 : Ascent items are unique objects that can be used to manipulate the spectral alignment of corresponding lights in the existential spectrum.
9149 : % and % are representative of such items. They're the pride and joy of our Jeuno-based research team, who'd have folk believe they're the greatest inventions since airships.
9150 : (Just between you and me, though, it is Far Eastern scientists that pioneered the technology they're based upon.)
9151 : They're not the only means by which we manipulate spectral alignment, mind you. Similar results can be achieved by performing specific actions against the enemy.
9152 : Truth be told, much is still shrouded in mystery. What actions will produce the desired effect is something you will have to discover for yourself through trial and error.
9153 : Defeating a Voidwalker will cause a mysterious pyxis to emerge at the selfsame planar rift whence the creature was felled.
9154 : Such riftworn pyxides exhibit a most peculiar characteristic: the content they bear reportedly changes depending on who glimpses within.
9155 : Our scientists conjecture that this is due to some trick of spectral alignment. As with numerous other mysteries surrounding Voidwalkers, however, I highly doubt they have even an inkling of understanding. But I digress...
9156 : Only one combatant need possess a voidstone for all party or alliance members to do battle with a Voidwalker. Of the other squad members only stratum abyssite is required.
9157 : As always seems to be the case, however, there is a catch. Pyxides have been observed to yield less spoils for combatants without a voidstone of their own.
9158 : It scarce needs be said, but it would be to your benefit to have both the aforementioned items readied before taking on a Voidwalker.
9159 : Lastly, a warning: pyxides will eventually vanish if left untouched overlong. Our scientists have put forth the theory of normalizing spatial dissonance, but you needn't concern yourself with their mumbo-jumbo.
9160 : Just see to it that your hard-earned spoils are claimed in good time, and things will be rosy for all involved.
9161 : The % is a magicked object produced by the Voidwatch's Jeuno-based research wing.
9162 : Its innocuous appearance belies the immense power it holds...the power to render Voidwalkers visible to its bearer.
9163 : The stone achieves this feat by realigning our existential spectrum to that of the creature.
9164 : I shall explain the process in layman's terms for your benefit. No need to thank me--I merely perform my duty.
9165 : I want you to visualize two canvases, each the same distance from the other. Yes, as two separate objects are normally wont to be.
9166 : Imagine you and I standing on one of the canvases--what else does one do with a canvas but stand on it, yes?
9167 : Now, imagine Voidwalkers standing on the other canvas, doing whatever it is Voidwalkers do. Destroying things and behaving with utter impropriety, no doubt.
9168 : Being on two different canvases, it follows that we cannot touch the Voidwalkers, let alone see them. Actually, that doesn't explain why we can't see the Voidwalkers...unless it's a magical canvas they're on that makes all things upon it invisible! Yes, that'll serve!
9169 : And this brings us full circle back to the voidstone. I want you to think of it as a magical paintbrush that we use to...grapple ourselves over to the Voidwalkers' canvas. Thence the fighting begins.
9170 : I trust you now have a rudimentary understanding of the process. That's all you need, really. Leave the fractal geometry to the fractal geometrists, I always say.
9171 : As long as you remember the canvas and the paintbrush--that's the voidstone--you cannot go astray. Now, to apprise you of more practical matters...
9172 : Twenty hours (Earth time) is required to produce a stone and imbue it with the necessary magicks, although word is that this may be shortened as research progresses.
9173 : Mind you, this isn't the only variety of stone you'll be needing. There exists another: stratum abyssite.
9174 : Whereas the voidstone serves as a power source, acting as a compass for channeling that power is stratum abyssite. Only by using the two in conjunction can we achieve our objectives.
9175 : Are you familiar with voiddust? Put simply, it is a granular substance from which voidstones may be fabricated.
9176 : As I explained, significant time is required to produce a voidstone from scratch. Provide me with voiddust, however, and I can fashion a stone for you in short order.
9177 : The same comrades of ours who stock ascent items may also furnish you with voiddust. Why do they not fabricate the stones themselves, or deliver the dust directly to me? Shush! The Voidwatch works in mysterious ways, and it would behoove you to inquire no further.
9178 : At any rate, should you manage to obtain any voiddust in your travels, you need only return here and trade it to me. Simple enough, wouldn't you say?
9179 : Furthermore, this particular variety of abyssite is known to absorb the energy released by felled Voidwalkers. Not any of the creatures, mind you, but only those drawn to planar rifts.
9180 : Based on the evolutionary state of your stratum abyssite, the Voidwatch will direct you to a suitable operation area.
9181 : If you wish to have your stone analyzed, simply present it to an atma refiner.
9182 : Planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space--have manifested across the land. The Voidwalker hordes roam beyond, unchecked and ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
9183 : By invoking the power of stratum abyssite, it is possible to battle the fell creatures as a Voidwatcher--a defender of our dimension.
9184 : Those also possessed of a voidstone will find their Voidwatcher experience greatly enhanced.
9185 : Alone, however, stratum abyssite serves no purpose; only when used in conjunction with a voidstone can its powers be unleashed.
9186 : Hence, at least one member of your squad--be it party or alliance--must possess a voidstone in order to arrange a confrontation with a Voidwalker.
9187 : Keep this fact in mind at all times.
9188 : It is not known when the planar rifts first manifested. Some say they've always been there, while others claim recent events have triggered their appearance.
9189 : If only we could return to the past, perhaps we could shed some light upon this mystery...
9190 : Obtainable by defeating Voidwalkers, cruor is an energy source that takes the form of shiny red granules.
9191 : While appearing to be some manner of mineral, detailed analysis has revealed that cruor is in fact organic.
9192 : As far as our researchers can tell, however, it's inanimate like most well-behaved plants. There's no fear of cruor suddenly springing to life in your palms.
9193 : Being supremely pleasing to the eyes, cruor might have adorned the display cases of many a jewelry shop during peacetime. Unfortunately, the age demands that its unique properties be put to more practical uses.
9194 : Namely, the infusion and enrichment of atmacite. If you wish to learn about these two processes, you need but ask an atmacite refiner, our experts on such matters.
9195 : As cruor is a vital aspect of our operations, the Voidwatch is always looking to procure more. Should you have any excess cruor, we would be glad to take it off your hands and offer you useful items in exchange.
9196 : Abyssite is the name given to a mysterious stone that assumes various forms and colors, the roles they serve likewise manifold in nature.
9197 : Of the copious varieties thus far discovered, there exist those called periapt--lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
9198 : Defeating a Voidwalker is known to yield periapt on very rare occasions. Serve the Voidwatch earnestly, however, and you will surely have one to call your own.
9199 : Select where voidstones will be consumed from.
9200 : Set to which? Key items. Stock.
9201 : Voidstones will now be taken from [your key items/the stock].
9202 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here is your voidstone! Take it and use it well.
9203 : Brought me voiddust, have you? Just one moment, now... And here are your voidstones! Take them and use them well.
9204 : It seems you already possess as many voidstones as you can carry. You'll want to hold on to that voiddust until you've depleted your supply.
9205 : How many do you need? (Cruor: #) None, thank you. One (# cruor). Three (# cruor). Six (# cruor). Nine (# cruor). Twelve (# cruor).
9206 : % obtains one % in exchange for # cruor.
9207 : % obtains # % in exchange for # cruor.

9216 : At attention, soldier! I've received an urgent alarum calling our best men to arms, and guess whose name is listed front and center? You're to report to Jeuno for further orders immediately.
9217 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me. Pick up those legs and get a move on!
9218 : Do we have a misunderstanding here, soldier? I said, immediately. You'll get your briefing at the palace, not from me.
9219 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate in Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through.
9220 : Time is short, so pick up those legs and get a move on, soldier!
9221 : That said, in these times of war, entry to the Grand Duchy is limited to authorized personnel. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate just over there and one of our men will see you through.
9222 : Excellent work, %. You serve the Voidwatch well. Your presence has been requested in the Grand Duchy once more. Make your way there with all speed.
9223 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace.
9224 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
9225 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate at Sauromugue and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
9226 : That is all. You're dismissed, soldier!
9227 : As before, a full briefing will be conducted upon your arrival at the palace. Show your alarum at the bulwark gate over there and one of our men will see you through the checkpoint.
9228 : Where's your %, soldier? I'll need to see one before I can authorize your participation in the [Jeuno/Qufim] Voidwatch jurisdiction.
9229 : % are issued only to those brave men and women who have distinguished themselves in regional Voidwatch efforts.
9230 : Prove yourself capable in the three nations, and you can rest assured that your abilities won't go overlooked. Keep fighting the good fight, soldier!
9231 : Reporting for combat, are you? Yes, this % of yours appears to be in order. Welcome aboard!
9232 : I suspect you've already been briefed about the use of %, but protocol dictates that I ask if you are in need of a review. What will it be, soldier?
9233 : What will it be, soldier? Ready for battle, sir! I need a briefing, sir!
9234 : Now that's what I like to hear, soldier!

9283 : Well, if this isn't the cat's meow. There is something you wish to ask of me? Hoping to have me shed some light on a particular matter?
9284 : ...This is wholly unexpected.
9285 : I've seen futures both brighter and darker, but in each at least there was a future.
9286 : Ah, but those feathered wings represent a new hope. A possibility to ensure that what should come to be...does come to be.
9287 : Perhaps it's best if we not paw around here, and consult Atomos instead. Ask his opinion.
9288 : Which means that you'll have need of this.
9289 : This should provide entry into what we call the Walk of Echoes.
9290 : The entrance there is the same as the entrance here--a cavernous maw. Gaping expanse of space.
9291 : %, you have come. Shown your face before me.
9292 : Alexander's cry has reached my ears.
9293 : Ah, I have awaited you. Hoped for this chance.
9294 : Unfurling here before you is the Walk of Echoes.
9295 : If you look above, you will see the prime avatar Atomos given physical form...
9296 : Or so you would think. No, the entire Walk of Echoes itself is Atomos. Its body and soul.
9297 : Some refer to him as the destroyer of worlds, for he feeds on futures that shall not come to pass. Whose existence is forbidden.
9298 : I trust you remember that Atomos consumes all futures that are forbidden.
9299 : And I'm sure the one question that must be pulling at your mind--bothering you to no end--is why Atomos is not feasting on your dark future as we speak.
9300 : I, too, have pondered that very question, and I will not play cat and mouse with you--that future is not a forbidden one.
9301 : There is nothing that I can do, what with Atomos so intricately connected to the laws of this world. So important to the way Vana'diel plays out.
9302 : Oh? That's not why you're here?
9303 : Why are you here? I need Iroha to be accepted. No real reason.
9304 : Come, come. We all know that's a bald-faced lie. Nothing could be further from the truth.
9305 : Out with it. You'll never get what you wish for unless you ask.
9306 : What a perplexing conundrum.
9307 : I am quite lucky to have been protected by the Goddess, but you...a great pair of white wings has wrapped you in its embrace, although I'm hard-pressed to say why. I haven't got a whit of an idea.
9308 : But those without such a boon cannot traverse the boundaries of time.
9309 : Why would you think there would be a means to save her?
9310 : You should count your blessings that Phoenix felt the need to save her at all. Most would have been left by the wayside.
9311 : Why that dour look? Don't tell me you're going to come mewling some trite complaint.
9312 : Well? Of course I'm upset! Isn't there anything we can do? I...suppose not.
9313 : An unsurprising response, to be sure.
9314 : Of course you're upset. It's understandable.
9315 : Forgive my starkness. A thousand apologies.
9316 : But don't mistake my honesty for callousness. Your story has shook me to the bones. Sent a chill up my spine.
9317 : I'm still letting it sink in--a force so mighty it can charm even Siren, the very mistress of seduction.
9318 : I'm positively at the end of my rope. My wits' end.
9319 : ...But there's still another option. Surely I don't need to tell you who Altana is.
9320 : Never once have I been able to set eyes on her.
9321 : But you...
9322 : A day may yet come when you will be able to see her in person. Become the most intimate of acquaintances.
9323 : Because you and yours are children of the Goddess.
9324 : And you bear a brighter future on your wings.
9325 : Wait! I have an idea. A flash of inspiration.
9326 : Altana may be able to provide Iroha the succor she seeks.
9327 : And if she can set everything right...it makes my whiskers twitch!
9328 : Her love is eternal, and surpasses the very laws of our world.
9329 : Of course, this leaves us the one small problem of how exactly you go about communing with her...
9330 : However, I know of a fabulous person who might have an answer... Lilisette.
9331 : I'll see if I can bring her to you. But it'll take some time.
9332 : Your first order of business should be to set things right in this world. Help subjugate the forces that threaten it.
9333 : I'll claw at the problem from a couple different angles in the meantime.
9334 : But never give up--spread your wings and soar to the heavens!
9335 : Aha!
9336 : %, it's you! Did you happen upon [that regal cat/Cait Sith] again?
9337 : Hmmm... Then I have a stranger question: have you been having any odd dreams lately?
9338 : %...
9339 : A first reunion was surprising enough, but a second!
9340 : This isn't going to be a happy one either, is it? What happened?
9341 : Cait Sith was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and I couldn't pluck the answers off her.
9342 : All I know is that it's got to be related to those dreams I've been having. You've seen them too, haven't you?
9343 : Is this another one of my dreams?
9344 : I've seen all manner of disturbing dreams lately. Perhaps because of Lilith's dark future...
9345 : You've seen similar ones too, haven't you?
9346 : Have you had odd dreams? Not dreams, but visions... Not really.
9347 : I knew I couldn't have been the only one!
9348 : They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.
9349 : Are you quite sure?
9350 : They shook me to the core. A blackness deeper than a starless night enveloped the world, and the screams of a thousand souls pierced the air.
9351 : I wanted to reach out to them, but instead of grasping their hands I began to float upward, my form bound by light.
9352 : I became one with that selfsame light...and the last thing I saw was your face.
9353 : Your visage was even more noble than usual, and you had become...a god.
9354 : Huh? You had a different dream?
9355 : Wh-what!? That's an ill omen if I ever heard one!
9356 : Could such terror truly be what the world has in store for us?
9357 : Then in my dreams...all that light... Was it just a fraud, and I'm totally powerless!?
9358 : What kind of trickery is this!?
9359 : How do you respond? I'll think of something. I need your help. ...
9360 : Oh, I see how it is. You're going to run off and save the world!
9361 : Hehe! I knew I should have had more confidence in you!
9362 : And so...do you have a plan to meet with Altana?
9363 : You say Cait Sith was on about meeting Altana being our only chance. But I wonder...
9364 : Maybe we'll be able to think of something if we put our heads together.
9365 : %, you're really something else.
9366 : You're right. Maybe we can come up with something if we put our heads together.
9367 : I'm not sure exactly how to go about it, though.
9368 : Cait Sith said that our best bet may lie in meeting with Altana?
9369 : Even if we are the wings of the Goddess, that doesn't mean we have all the answers.
9370 : We might have to rack our brains for this one...
9371 : S-sorry for stepping out of line.
9372 : I might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but that doesn't mean I can't try my best to come up with something.
9373 : After all, it's up to us to protect both the future and the past--and I hope you'd expect nothing less of me!
9374 : So...Cait Sith said that meeting Altana might be our only shot?
9375 : We might be the Goddess's wings, but...well, nothing pops right to mind.
9376 : Maybe we'll find a solution if we put our heads together.
9377 : Oh? What is...
9378 : Goodness! By the stars, what just happened!?
9379 : That was no dream, right? Or was it? I...I saw the future!
9380 : Nothing super far away, mind you, but something close that the two of us can bring about together!
9381 : %, not only did I see the future, but also the past. Memories of the times we spent together, both warm and cold. A phantasmagoric kaleidoscope of images.
9382 : You're...absolutely sure I'm not dead? Hehehe!
9383 : Something awful's happened! Not good at all!
9384 : If it isn't that odd kitty cat!
9385 : Cait Sith...? What's wrong?
9386 : %, it's about that ambassador friend of yours. The person you've been looking for.
9387 : He found his way [here/to the Walk of Echoes]!
9388 : The Walk of Echoes?
9389 : Oh dear. Here. I'll let % explain the rest. Fill you in on the particulars.
9390 : I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!
9391 : How terrible must this foe be if he's managed to make his way [to this world/to the Walk of Echoes]?
9392 : %, I need you to make haste! Move like the wind!
9393 : Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!
9394 : Quick! I'll open up a passage for you!
9395 : That orb you carry...the light erased all my doubts and fears. I'm ready for whatever may come to pass.
9396 : Together we have the strength to conquer the darkness!
9397 : I'll be waiting for you in the Walk of Echoes.
9398 : And this Walk of Echoes...we can get there from a cavernous maw?
9399 : Got it! I'll meet you there!
