6984 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
6985 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
6986 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
6987 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6988 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6989 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6990 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6991 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6992 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6993 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6994 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6995 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6996 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6997 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6998 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6999 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7000 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7001 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7002 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7003 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7004 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7005 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7006 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7007 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7008 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7009 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7010 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7011 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7012 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7013 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7014 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7015 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7016 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7017 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7018 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7019 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7020 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7021 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7022 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7023 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7024 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7025 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7026 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7027 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7028 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7029 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7030 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7031 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7032 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7033 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7034 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7035 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7036 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7037 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7038 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7039 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7040 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7046 : Keep your eyes peeled! I'm going in for the big one!

7048 : I'm warmed up now. Time for a real attack!
7049 : Don't blink now! Follow my lead!
7050 : Are you ready? I'm taking my shot!
7051 : Alrighty! Here goes nothing!
7052 : Are you ready? I'm beginning my attack!

7087 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7088 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7089 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7090 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7091 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7092 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7093 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7094 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7095 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7096 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7097 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7098 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7099 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7100 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7101 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7102 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7103 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7104 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7105 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7106 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7107 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7108 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7109 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7110 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7316 : Welcome to Bostaunieux Oubliette...
7317 : My name is Cyranuce M. Cutauleon, and I have been here for a very long time.
7318 : It seems to be locked.
7319 : In past times, it was said that nobles accused of treason were thrown down there. They would wander for days through the maze of sewer tunnels, until they would finally collapse from starvation.
7320 : Now terrible beasts prowl through the darkness. If you have the courage, you may enter.
7321 : What will you do? Open the lid and enter. Stay up here for now.
7322 : Hi!
7323 : This is Bostaunieux Oubliette, where all the criminals of the Kingdom are kept.
7324 : If you continue on this way, you will come out in West Ronfaure. It's the only way out.
7325 : Those without business here should be on their way. That means you.
7326 : Say, would you be so kind as to bring me %?
7327 : What do you say? Sure. No way.
7328 : So you will bring me %? Please then, make haste.
7329 : And...thank you.
7330 : If you have a moment, will you hear my request?
7331 : Listen to him? Hear what he has to say. No way.
7332 : Ah. I see. Don't mind me, then.
7333 : I want you to bring me %.
7334 : Just...don't ask me why. How about it? Will you do this for me?
7335 : Accept Novalmauge's request? Accept. Turn him down.
7336 : Ah...ah-hah. That is to be expected, I guess. Sorry to ask such a ludicrous favor! Don't worry yourself about it.
7337 : That is good news, indeed. Please hurry, I beg you.
7338 : Eh? What? You'll take my request?
7339 : That is good news, indeed. I want you to bring me %, and as fast as you can.
7340 : You do me a great service. It is hard to find such a helper. I thank you.
7341 : You've...heard about me? That I am some sort of blood-sucker...a freak of nature? And of course, you'd believe them...everyone does.
7342 : Do you believe the rumors? Yes, I do. Never!
7343 : Never mind... You seem to be a kind soul, so I will tell you. I have a disease.
7344 : Whenever the light of the sun touches my skin, it burns me in a horrible fashion.
7345 : I was poisoned, long ago... That is how I became this way. And I have been trying to find a cure, some kind of serum, ever since.
7346 : After many experiments, I found that these % are the only things that ease my pain.
7347 : Yes, I've become quite knowledgeable in the ways of poisons. People still shun me, but I do not blame them.
7348 : The people of San d'Oria can see only with their own eyes, never another's. They think their own view superior to all.
7349 : But you, my friend, are different. If there is anything I can do, you need but ask me.
7350 : Here, take this. It is not much, but it is all I have. I give you my thanks.
7351 : This dungeon has a dark past, especially the deepest room. There are many strange tales about it, yes...
7352 : I wouldn't be surprised if you were the one to uncover the truth.
7353 : Eh? Someone threw poison in the water by the sluice gate? You want me to make a neutralizer, then?
7354 : I prefer to avoid goings-on of this sort, but I cannot refuse a request from you after what you have done for me. All right, I will see what I can do!
7355 : Bring me %. We can use it to make a neutralizer that should put things to rights...I hope.
7356 : Bring me %. We can use it to make a neutralizer that should put things to rights...I hope.
7357 : You've brought me %? Excellent! Now, I need a little time.
7358 : There! With this all will be well. Of course, it saddens me to hear this sort of thing still goes on up there. After all this time, they haven't changed.
7359 : Cyranuce? No, you'll not find him here. He is dead. His cellmate was a beastmaster, who somehow called forth a terrible creature and fled.
7360 : His beast knocked a gaping hole in the wall, so he was home free. But Cyranuce's body was found underneath the creature. It's too bad... We could've saved him if we got here sooner!
7361 : Yeah, I know.
7362 : Rahal was jealous of his friend Cyranuce for becoming a dragoon. He set a trap for him, and saw him thrown into this very dungeon.
7363 : That is how Rahal, the dragonslayer tainted with drakes' blood, seized the office of general. You knights were left in the dark.
7364 : What!? Lies, all of it!
7365 : Lies? Well then, why was Rahal always coming to check on him? He was waiting for Cyranuce to kick the bucket, wasn't he?
7366 : No, it can't be!
7367 : Hmph. The only people who can become dragonslayers are those who truly hate them. They're not after treasure or jewels; they just want to exterminate them!
7368 : And he couldn't wait to kill dragons and dragoons! Ahahaha!
7369 : Why, you--!
7370 : If you wish to learn of dragons, ask the archeologist, Oiheaurese, in the cathedral. He should know well their lore.
7371 : What do ya think you're lookin' at? You don't know nothing about what's really going on under this hellhole do ya? Compared to the sewers, my cell is a palace!
7372 : Oh yeah, I think I heard about some scientists who ran off into the sewers during the war. They say only one got out, but that he was messed up in the head for the rest of his life.
7373 : Rumor has it that there's a way out of there. Maybe the old guy got lucky.
7374 : You are also a wielder of the scythe? And quite a skilled one, I dare say. Though it may not appear likely, I, too, have some small ability with that weapon. I actually have quite a collection of scythes.
7375 : One of the scythes I possess has a decidedly ominous aura. Cursed is the only way I can describe it. A perfectly sane person who takes up this scythe begins to act in the most unusual manner...
7376 : It is said, however, that if the curse on the scythe can be overcome by the heat of many battles, the wielder gains the knowledge of a new weapon technique. What say you? Are you up to the challenge?
7377 : What say you? I'll take a swing at it. I haven't the time right now.
7378 : Excellent. Here is the weapon. When the curse has been lifted, the scythe will lose its power. Bring it back to me when this happens and I will see if the blight has truly been cleansed.
7379 : Take care not to lose yourself to the curse...
7380 : If that's the case, perhaps it would be better if you forgot we ever had this conversation...
7381 : How goes it? If you wish to know if the curse has been removed, then let me see the %. Or perhaps there was something else you wished to discuss?
7382 : Was there something else? I lost the %... This curse has bested me. No, sorry to disturb you.
7383 : Strangely enough, I just came into possession of another such scythe. I would advise against handing these weapons around to your compatriots, though. They are not toys to be played with, my friend.
7384 : Naturally, you must begin the process of removing the curse anew. A lack of focus can cost you dearly. Please do be careful this time.
7385 : I agree that this is a dangerous feat to attempt, but I believe that you have the strength of spirit to prevail. If you persevere until the end, your reward will be great. Do you still wish to give up?
7386 : What is your decision? I can go no further. I will persevere.
7387 : That is good. But do not let your focus waver, or the curse will gain hold of you. Take care, my friend.
7388 : If you feel your resolve crumbling, then you are right to end your attempt here.
7389 : I advise you to rest for a time to cleanse your spirit of evil influences. Dispose of the scythe and do not pass it on to anyone else.
7390 : You still need to cleanse the scythe in several more battles before the curse's influence is removed. Be sure the curse does not find a new home in you.
7391 : You have done splendidly. However, there is still one thing that remains to be done.
7392 : Ugh...
7393 : You must excuse me. My supply of medicine has run dry and I'm not in the best of shape these days.
7394 : What caused my condition, you ask?
7395 : I was once forced to undergo battle training in a certain place. It was there I was given a potion to drink that reduced me to this pitiful state...
7396 : I spent days on end in blackness, on the brink of losing my very sense of self. I finally managed to crawl out of that darkness with my sanity intact, but my companions are still...
7397 : Enough of this talk. Your final trial awaits you. If this test is not completed, your effort until this point will have been for naught.
7398 : Journey to the Den of Rancor with this % and obtain the %. When you have bound the evil in the scythe, your exertions will be at an end.
7399 : I will hold the % here for your return. My prayers go with you...
7400 : Journey to the Den of Rancor with this % and obtain the %. When you have bound the evil in the scythe, your exertions will be at an end.
7401 : I knew you would return victorious. Another soul...ah, another scythe has been freed from its curse. You have my gratitude.
7402 : Novalmauge, here's that oversized scythe of yours, freshly sharpened.
7403 : Thank you, Brugaire. Here is your usual fee.
7404 : As long as I get my money I don't much care, but what the hell are you doing with this thing? I've never seen anyone blunt a blade so quickly.
7405 : I was under the impression that the Brugaire Consortium respected the privacy of its customers. Was I mistaken?
7406 : Good grief, man. I'm not trying to grill you, I was just curious.
7407 : Well, I don't want to invade your privacy any longer, so I'll just get out of here, shall I? You oughta give a little thought to your reputation outside of your little world here. You're not exactly Mister Popular up in town.
7408 : I'll be seeing you.
7409 : ...
7410 : I feel I can tell you the truth of my situation.
7411 : Do you remember how I spoke of being forced to undergo battle training at a certain place?
7412 : The ones that captured me were shadows. Surely you have seen them? Those undead creatures that resemble Elvaan?
7413 : They kidnap young children, who are made to drink a vile potion while learning the arts of war. Eventually the children become shadows themselves. That is how they increase their numbers.
7414 : Have you heard the tales of Elvaan children disappearing from the Kingdom? This is the work of the shadows.
7415 : Hard to believe? I know it to be true, for I was one of those children...
7416 : The shadows that roam the darkness today were once my friends, abducted as I was. When the transformation into shadow is complete, all sense of self is lost. My companions no longer recognize me.
7417 : To release their souls from damnation, I shun the sun's rays and hunt shadows in this perpetual night. This scythe is their salvation.
7418 : I escaped that blackest night once, only to find a deeper kind of darkness waiting for me in the form of despair. Perhaps this is my penance for being the sole survivor.
7419 : I cannot blame people for thinking I am some kind of vampire. I see my own actions as monstrous.
7420 : But I care not for other people's opinions; I merely do what I must. To grant their souls peace by my own hand...I owe my companions that, at least.
7421 : Forgive me, my friends...
7422 : My entire existence is here in the darkness.
7423 : Whenever you release the soul of a shadow, I ask that you whisper a prayer for them:
7424 : May your next life be bathed in blessd light...
7425 : You have learned the weapon skill Spiral Hell!
7426 : You sense an ominous presence...
7427 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7428 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7429 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7430 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7431 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7432 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7433 : Now, listen close...
7434 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7435 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7436 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7437 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7438 : .........listen......
7439 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7440 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7441 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. The Rumor(pt.1). The Rumor(pt.2). Trouble at the Sluice. The Holy Crest. Souls in Shadow(pt.1). Souls in Shadow(pt.2). Souls in Shadow(pt.3). Curilla Unleashed.
7445 : Are you ready for a spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
7446 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
7447 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
7448 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
7449 : You're not wearing your yukata! Put it on and show me how it looks, kupo!
7450 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
7451 : Wear the yukata the next time you come to see me! I can't wait to see how you look, kupo!
7452 : Partner up with lots of different adventurers and bring back all kinds of trophies to prove your courage! When you've brought enough, I'll give you something really special, kupo!
7453 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
7454 : Incredible, kupo! You must have nerves of darksteel! Here, you've earned this, kupo!
7455 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
7456 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
7457 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
7458 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
7459 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
7460 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
7461 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
7462 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
7463 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
7464 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
7465 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
7466 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
7467 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
7468 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
7469 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
7470 : You can only carry one %.
7471 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
7472 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
7473 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
7474 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
7475 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
7476 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
7477 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
7478 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
7479 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
7480 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
7481 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
7482 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
7483 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?
7484 : If it gets out that I haven't scared the wits out of a single person yet, I'm going to get into trouble, kupo...
7485 : Unable to enter next area. Expansion pack not installed.
7486 : A grounds tome has been placed here by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.). Useful information pertaining to various topics on field operations fills its pages.
7487 : What will you do? Nothing. Read about individual training. Review current training regime. Cancel current training regime. Read about field support. Read about prowesses. Review active prowesses.
7488 : Which page? I've changed my mind. Page 1. Page 2. Page 3. Page 4. Page 5. Page 6. Page 7. Page 8. Page 9. Page 10.
7489 : The information on this page instructs you to defeat the following:
