6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7324 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
7325 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
7326 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7327 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7328 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7329 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7330 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7331 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7332 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7333 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7334 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7335 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7336 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7337 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7338 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7339 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7340 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7341 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7342 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7343 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7344 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7345 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7346 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7347 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7348 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7349 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
7350 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
7351 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
7352 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.
7353 : A mysterious power absorbs the malice!
7354 : Please select absorption value. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

7376 : A portal has opened within the depths of the maw.
7377 : Raise your %? Yes. No.
7378 : You fit the % into the hollow.
7379 : There is a hollow here in the shape of %.
7380 : The lycopodium is entranced by a sparkling light...
7381 : Your memory is engraved with an image of your surroundings and the fragrance of flowers...
7382 : The ground is sparkling with a strange light.
7383 : The sparkling light seems vaguely familiar to you...
7384 : You sense that a certain trigger may awaken the memories slumbering in your mind.
7385 : The fragrance of the flower sends your senses reeling back to the world of the past...
7386 : The relevant battle data has been recorded in your %.
7387 : An unseen force is drawing you towards the maw.

7397 : You see something stuck behind the signpost.
7398 : Something has been buried here.
7399 : You thought you saw something, but find nothing.
7400 : You see a message engraved on the stone:
7401 : The wind that blows incessantly through this area is called Odin's Wrath. Seeing its potential use, some ingenious Bastokers decided to build windmills here, a long time ago.
7402 : Flourmills, to be exact. In this desolate land where nothing more than potatoes can grow, the wheat brought in from San d'Oria was a true lifesaver to Bastokers.
7403 : San d'Oria, in turn, relied on their consumption of its surplus wheat, and also on the flour that came back from Bastok's mills. The mills became the symbols of their mutual dependence.
7404 : Even in times of war between the two, this trade continued. Both armies' brass were infuriated, but none tried to disrupt it lest the bread disappeared from their own tables! Ah, the irony!
7405 : A toast, to the merchants!   --Gwynham Ironheart, 750 Crystal Era.
7406 : You receive nothing from the moon rabbit...
7407 : The moon rabbit has brought along a monster!
7408 : You have to do something about those crazy trees, kupo!
7409 : You're done fighting trees, kupo?
7417 : If you wish to ride a chocobo, you must possess % and have a high enough job level.
7418 : You can rent a chocobo for # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
7419 : You can rent a chocobo, but because your level is so low, you won't be able to ride for very long. Also, equipment that extends your riding time will have no effect.
7420 : If you still want one, it will cost you # gil. I see you currently have # gil.
7421 : Do you wish to rent a chocobo? Yes, I do. No, thank you.
7422 : You don't have enough gil.
7423 : You cannot obtain the %. Come back after sorting your inventory.
7424 : Would you be so kind as to deliver her to [the entrance to the Gustav Tunnel (B-8)/Bibiki Bay (G-10)/the entrance of Uggalepih Temple (J-11)]?
7425 : Only those fulfilling both requirements set forth by the alliance may ride a chocobo. First, you must be a soldier of a respectable level in the Allied Forces. Secondly, you must be in possession of %.
7426 : Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of # Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have # Allied Notes.
7427 : Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
7428 : I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with %. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?
7429 : Roar!
7430 : Grrroar!
7431 : Grrrgroooar! Grrrgroooarrr!

7440 : Oooh, nice! He says, You're going be in for a grrreataru year with oodles of elation!
7441 : That was, Justaru the rrright amount of happiness is going to be coming your way!
7442 : That translates to, You win some, you lose some. But on the whole, there's no rrreason-weason why you should be pessimistic!
7443 : Uh-oh! That was, You'll need to dig deepy-weep for some luck of your own this yearrr!
7444 : Hrrrm... Rather than interpretaru that, let me just say, whatever happens this year, always rememberrr to keep your chinny-win up!
7445 : A fabulous-wabulous yearrr to you, adventurer!

7450 : Come, %.  Follow me...
7451 : Carbuncle vanished off in the direction of the La Theine Plateau.
7452 : Carbuncle vanished off to another area in the La Theine Plateau.
7453 : The % jumps in your hands.
7454 : Ahahahahaha! I can sense the power of the ring! Get yourself moving [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7455 : Ahahahahaha! Don't slow down now, slacker! The readings are coming from the [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7456 : Ahahahahaha! You're getting close now! I can feel the ring's power from the next area!
7457 : Ahahahahaha! You're almost on top of it! It's somewhere in this area!
7458 : There is a blackened spot on the ground...
7459 : This is the blackened spot you were told about. You should place % here.
7460 : You place % on the blackened spot.
7461 : You place % on the blackened spot, but nothing happens.
7462 : You have to be closer to place anything on the blackened spot.
7463 : This looks like a sturdy branch. You will need % to cut it off.
7464 : It is a beautiful, sturdy branch.
7465 : You feel as if you are being watched.
7466 : You can sense a strong, evil presence!
7467 : Some strange force is preventing you from cutting all the way through.
7468 : The strange force has vanished, and % has newly sprouted in the cut!
7469 : You no longer sense the evil presence, but there is still a feeling of unrest throughout the forest.
7470 : The newly sprouted % is glowing softly. You no longer feel as if you are being watched.
7471 : This is not the time for that!
7472 : Gimme everything ya got in your bag.

7498 : The telepoint has been shattered into a thousand pieces...
7499 : Investigate further? Yes. No.
7500 : Have you made your preparations?
7501 : Preparations complete? Yes. Not yet.
7502 : Hm...? Someone seems to have arrived here before us.
7503 : %, state your reason for coming here.
7504 : You! What are you doing here?
7505 : Calm down, Ayame. [He's/She's] an adventurer. It's [his/her] job to go adventuring.
7506 : We're here to investigate something. It could get pretty dangerous, so I suggest taking a few steps back if you know what's good for you.
7507 : Why, Cid. What business do you have here today?
7508 : Well, if it isn't little Wolfgang. How have you been?
7509 : We're here to check out the Crystal Line. Recently I've been receiving some very strange readings from this area.
7510 : According to the data retrieved by a Republican party that visited here last month, the once stable energy flow has begun to fluctuate.
7511 : I've never seen such high readings...
7512 : The flow of energy is so overwhelming that the Telepoint you see over there was shattered to pieces! And now there are reports that a giant beast appeared over the sea, just to the north of Delkfutt's Tower.
7513 : I have a bad feeling that these two events are connected, and that they're warning us of something worse to come.
7514 : ... I understand that research inclines you to pursue these matters. However, I ask that you leave the investigation to the Duchy.
7515 : Eh? So the Duchy knows the cause of all these strange phenomena?
7516 : Not exactly. We have numerous parties investigating the situation. However, many of those sent into the field have...vanished.
7517 : We cannot allow any more accidents. The damage to Vana'diel would be great if we were to lose such an important engineer as you, Cid.
7518 : Hah!  Let me guess... The scientists back in Jeuno told you to get rid of all those who got in their way.
7519 : Who do they think they are!? Come to think of it, I have good reason to believe that it's those lunatics that are causing all this trouble!
7520 : Wh-what is going on!?
7521 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7522 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7523 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7524 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7525 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7526 : Now, listen close...
7527 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7528 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7529 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7530 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7531 : .........listen......
7532 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7533 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7534 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. The Mothercrystals. To Paste a Peiste(pt.1). To Paste a Peiste(pt.2). At the Heavens' Door(pt.1).

7538 : No more goodies 'round here! Me go looks somewheres else!
7539 : Where next one?
7540 : We no lose to smelly Moogles this time!
7541 : Need more cards!
7542 : ......?
7543 : Lookin' for cards in all the wrong places.
7544 : This chocobo riding is a lot more painful than it looks. I think I'm starting to chafe.
7545 : I wonder how much I could get for this at the local pawnshop...
7546 : Would somebody explain to me why we're collecting these things again?
7547 : Digging holes in the dirt... Yeah, this is my idea of excitement.
7548 : % digs up # strange trading [card/cards] and places [it/them] in the treasure pool.
7549 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7550 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!
7551 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7552 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip the %, kupo!
7553 : I can't work my moogle magic while you're involved in other events, kupo!
7554 : Time elapsed: # [hour/hours] (Vana'diel time) # [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] (Earth time)
7555 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7556 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!
7557 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7558 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip % or %, kupo!
7559 : The compass reads # yalms.
7560 : The compass is pointing [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].
7561 : You find something buried in the ground!
7562 : This is not the right checkpoint!
7563 : You cannot check any more points.
7565 : There is treasure somewhere in the vicinity of this marker...
7566 : K-KWEHHH!!! (You're right on top of it!)
7567 : Kwehhh!? (The treasure is close!)
7568 : Kweh!?
7569 : Kweh.
7570 : ...
7571 : Kweh! Kweh! Kwehhh! (You've found a treasure chest!)
7572 : You cannot open that treasure chest.
7573 : Your chocobo seems a little fatigued.
7574 : Your chocobo refuses to dig any more. Perhaps you should try another day.
7575 : You cannot retrieve the treasure chest just yet. Try again in a few moments.
7576 : KWEHHHHHH!!! (You've hit the jackpot!)
7577 : Your chocobo seems especially sharp today!
7578 : Your chocobo seems especially energetic today!
7579 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
7580 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
7581 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
7582 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
7583 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7584 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
7585 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
7586 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
7587 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
7588 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
7589 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
7590 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
7591 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7592 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
7593 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7594 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
7595 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7596 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
7597 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
7598 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
7599 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
7600 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
7601 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
7602 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
7603 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
7604 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
7605 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.
7606 : Your fate is currently entwined in the swirling mists of [Promyvion - Holla/Promyvion - Dem/Promyvion - Mea].
7607 : By sealing off a portion of your memory, your destiny within this realm of Promyvion can be altered.
7608 : This will allow you to return to the entrance of the crag, having forgotten all events regarding this place.

7657 : Enter the garrison? Yes. No.
7658 : The % is ripped violently to pieces!
7659 : Greetings, fair traveler. My people would entreat thy assistance, and offer rich reward in return. Thou shouldst speak with my sister Callisto, who abides in Grauberg's Witchfire Glen.
7660 : Hark! Our foe lurks thither. How wouldst thou proceed?
7661 : How will you proceed? Withdraw. Charge in. Scout the enemy. Check weapon.

10851 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
10852 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
10853 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
10854 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
10855 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
10856 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
10857 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
10858 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
10859 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
10860 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
10861 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
10862 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
10863 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
10864 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
10865 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
10866 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
10867 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
10868 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
10869 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
10870 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
10871 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
10872 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.
10873 : Here's a list of all the located tablets, kupo!
10874 : Choose a location: West Ronfaure. East Ronfaure. La Theine Plateau. Valkurm Dunes. Jugner Forest. Batallia Downs. North Gustaberg. South Gustaberg. Konschtat Highlands. Pashhow Marshlands.

10875 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there by %, kupo!
10876 : The tablet of [temperance/fortitude/piety/justice/hope/wisdom/compassion/dignity/loyalty/charity/courage] was discovered there, kupo!
10877 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
10878 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
10879 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
10880 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!
10881 : Martial Master! As an added bonus to your Signet, combat skills will increase more rapidly! Your magic and automaton skills will be boosted, too!
10882 : Blood of the Vampyr! Signets have been boosted with the abilities of Regeneration and Refresh!
10883 : Treasure Hound! With Signet in effect, you will now be able to sniff out more treasure and gil! Great riches surely await you, kupo!
10884 : Artisan's Advantage! Good news for aspiring artisans, kupo! When receiving advanced image support, the chance of your ingredients being lost in a failed synthesis attempt has been drastically reduced!
10885 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?
10886 : Dilatory Digestion! Not content to be left behind, brown magic slides back out for another go, kupo! Now you can be what you eat for twice as long and save on all those trips to your local merchant.
10887 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
10888 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
10889 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
10890 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
10892 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
10893 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
10894 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
10895 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
10896 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
10897 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
10898 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
10899 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
10900 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
10901 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
10902 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

10921 : Hi there! I'm  your friendly neighborhood smile sergeant! I'm in charge of running the [beginner/intermediate/advanced] level Smilebringer Boot Camp in this area.
10922 : I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you might have...and of course, sign you up, too! You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hmmm?
10923 : What will you do? Undertake training. Hear an explanation. What's the qualifying time? What's the fastest time? Nothing.
10924 : Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don't have %. Well, that's just too bad!
10925 : It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem! The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!
10926 : The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.
10927 : But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree. The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!
10928 : Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!
10929 : With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da! Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.
10930 : The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor! When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. Smile helpers are posted at each, so you can't miss them!
10931 : Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage. The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?
10932 : I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.
10933 : Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!
10934 : What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!
10935 : Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!
10936 : One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled. But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?
10937 : So far, the fastest time in this area is # minute[/s] # second[/s]. Wow! And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is %. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?
10938 : We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within # minute[/s] # second[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young [wolf/vixen] like you, surely! And if you manage a time quicker than # minute[/s] # second[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?
10939 : Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad... But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!
10940 : At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of # gil from each participant. All proceeds go towards presents for the children. Oh, won't you think of the children? <Sniffle>...
10941 : Give to the children? I live to give! Charity begins at home.
10942 : But of course! First, I'll need you to lend me your %... Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!
10943 : You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated. Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?
10944 : There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you. If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>
10945 : So, are you ready-steady? [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO! Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!
10946 : Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.
10947 : But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!
10948 : Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness. Let's start from the top, shall we?
10949 : Oh, what're you doing here? Aren't you in the middle of a run right now? Couldn't stand to be parted from your favorite smile sergeant, maybe? Teehee!
10950 : What will you do? Hear an explanation. Where're the smile helpers again? Cancel the training. Nothing.
10951 : Awww... These rivulets of tears streaming down my face... B-but it's okay... You have your own reasons for quitting, and I understand... <Sob>
10952 : Welcome back! Let's check your time, shall we? You cleared the course in # minute[/s] # second[/s].
10953 : Oh my Goddess! You've set a new record for this area! Hooray! Somebody, break out the fireworks!
10954 : You've successfully qualified! Yay! Here's a little something to commemorate this marvelous achievement.
10955 : You obtain %!
10956 : Ah, just the knowledge that there're capable adventurers like you around helps me sleep better at night. The children...they're in good hands... <Sob>
10957 : You did just fine, but don't be resting on those laurels, you hear? As we smilebringers say, there's always a bigger, brighter smile to be had!
10958 : Oh no! I'm afraid your time falls short of qualification! As much as I want to give you a passing grade, headquarters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
10959 : Oh no! Please don't be mad, but...I forgot to record your time. I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this scatterbrain of a smile sergeant...
10960 : It might surprise you to learn this, but even the toughest--grrrrrr!--and roughest of us smilebringers need rest and relaxation. Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!
10961 : Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, work hard, play hard is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too. After you complete a run with a qualifying time--yay!--you're required to rest up until the next day (Vana'diel time).
10962 : Awww, seeing the way you're simply bursting with enthusiasm makes me want to cry tears of joy. But you have to be cruel to be kind. No more training until tomorrow, young [man/lady]! No siree!

11006 : Well, then that must make you %.
11007 : Joachim's told me much about you. It's a true pleasure to finally meet face-to-face.
11008 : My name's Norrah. Like Joachim, I'm a native of Abyssea.
11009 : We're eternally grateful to you, %, for coming to the aid of a world not your own.
11010 : What little help we have to offer, my comrades and I intend to give all to you.
11011 : Never before has our world seen such dark times. The Abyssean hordes appeared without warning, seemingly out of nowhere.
11012 : It all happened so suddenly... Our nations' defenses were pitiful things against the enemy's unquenchable lust for blood.
11013 : The result being a world ruled by death and destruction.
11014 : It's hard to believe that Abyssea once rivaled your world--Vana'diel, was it?--in beauty.
11015 : But everything changed after that fateful day...
11016 : The cavernous maw you see before you leads to the Konschtat Highlands of Abyssea. Don't let the name lull you into complacency, though, or you'll surely meet a premature end.
11017 : The Konschtat that lies beyond is a far cry from the idyllic highlands that you know. It is swarming with fell creatures, among which is one that has attained particular notoriety.
11018 : A giant, mutated subspecies of peiste is the best way to describe it. Its venom is reported to be of such potency, a dashing of it would burn a gaping hole through your garb.
11019 : This beast has wreaked immeasurable havoc upon my people. Putting an end to its reign of terror would restore much needed morale to the resistance effort.
11020 : I realize that this is but one monster--a drop in the ocean. Yet all journeys, no matter how long, must have a beginning. And this journey is one we cannot complete without the company of brave souls such as you, %.
11021 : There is one piece of knowledge that might give you heart: There're others out there who share your gift. If you were to join together in common cause, there is no limit to what can be achieved.
11022 : Before you go, %, remember always that knowing the enemy is half the battle. Take whatever time you need to acclimatize to Abyssea.
11023 : The last thing we need is to lose a newfound ally to a mishap that might have been averted.
11024 : Go carefully now, %.
11025 : Welcome back, %.
11026 : Although I'm hardly the one to say those words to you.
11027 : Small talk aside, word of your courageous display has already reached me. A terrible menace is no more, and we have you to thank for it.
11028 : Truth be told, there are often times when I am given to despair.
11029 : It's as though a voice in my head taunts me, saying that nothing will ever change, no matter how hard I try.
11030 : But your heroic feats have done much to silence that voice of doubt, and for that, I thank you.
11031 : Please accept this as a token of my appreciation.
11032 : It's %. I'm made to understand it works especially well for your people.
11033 : Why has this terrible fate befallen Abyssea? I'm of the belief that everything--no matter how dreadful--happens for a reason.
11034 : Be that as it may, I don't intend to lay down arms and bare my throat to fate's cruel fangs. I mean to fight so long as I draw breath.

11088 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11089 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11090 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11091 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11092 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11093 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11094 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11095 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11096 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11097 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11098 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11099 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11100 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11101 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11102 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11103 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11104 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11105 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11106 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11107 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11108 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11109 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11110 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11111 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11112 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11113 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11114 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11115 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11116 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11117 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11118 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11119 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11120 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11121 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11122 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11123 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11124 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11125 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11126 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11127 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11128 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11129 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
11130 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%

11961 : Any temporary items you possess will be destroyed, beneficial effects will be removed, and TP will be reset.
11962 : You must dismiss your fellow first.
11963 : What you seek lies only a few steps ahead...
11964 : %... Why? Why am I...here?
11965 : Am I still dreaming? Or can it really be...?
11966 : Lately, I've seen the strangest visions...
11967 : As I waited for you here, this crystal--it spoke to me...and I fell into a trance.
11968 : It was but another vision.
11969 : People fled to the four corners of Vana'diel, futilely trying to escape an ever-growing cloud of darkness.
11970 : And there I stood, frozen, my legs unable to do so much as quiver.
11971 : The mothercrystal's vision can't be simple happenstance.
11972 : Not everyone is aware that our world--our Vana'diel--is protected by the benevolence of the mothercrystal.
11973 : Look all around you. This place is no accident.
11974 : The technologies required to make these structures are beyond any known to us.
11975 : Those who came before doubtlessly created this facility to shelter the crystal from harm.
11976 : But I wonder...
11977 : There's some reason why the same visions continue to float before my eyes.
11978 : So I came here, to the mothercrystal.
11979 : Our world has remained resilient thanks to mothercrystals' blessings.
11980 : But what if it is our turn to protect her?
11981 : In my dream, an infernal gloom obscured the mothercrystal from view.
11982 : This mothercrystal isn't the only one, of course, and I've no way of knowing if I'm even at the right one...
11983 : Wait--does that mean you've seen the same vision?
11984 : ...I see. Then this Iroha came from a future where much the same thing has happened.
11985 : Then the beastmen that ravage the three nations are not to blame. So... So what is this Emptiness?
11986 : She might be the only one with the answers I seek.
11987 : Where could we run into her again?
11988 : Giving up isn't in my vocabulary, yet we've no choice but to hold off for now.
11989 : In the meantime, I'd like you to go to the place I saw in my dream. I'd go myself, but....
11990 : In the meantime, I'd like you to go to the place I saw in my dream.
11991 : How about it? I'll go. I can't right now. Uh...go where, exactly?
11992 : If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours...but I can't force you.
11993 : Thank you. I'm pretty sure the place I saw was somewhere near Jeuno.
11994 : I'm pretty sure the place I saw was somewhere near Jeuno.
11995 : Where did the vision take place? Lower Jeuno. Delkfutt's Tower. Qufim Island.
11996 : Do you think? I'm not so sure...
11997 : That's it! It's so clear to me now!
11998 : I wish I could go with you, but know that I'm there in spirit.
11999 : It doesn't take a soothsayer to know that darkness bodes ill. Stay safe.
12000 : I'll be there, %.
12001 : Master! Look--Lady Lion!
12002 : Master!
12003 : Lion? Lion!?
12004 : I...saw it again...
12005 : %, that special orb you have is a relic from the future.
12006 : Maybe that explains the visions I've been having.
12007 : If what it portends is true, then there is nothing we can do to stop the darkness from approaching.
12008 : But %, I saw nothing about whether or not you were there to try to stop it.
12009 : What if there is no one to stand up for Vana'diel? Will it perish with but a whimper?
12010 : Lion, perhaps it is because the orb is not yet fully illuminated.
12011 : I agree. Yet we learned about the coming darkness before the light could fully arrive...likely ushering it in before we were ready.
12012 : I know not what the two of you are on about, so I will ask one simple question: what can we do?
12013 : %, another image that floated before my eyes was one of you vanquishing the Shadow Lord.
12014 : The Shadow Lord!?
12015 : And the crystal spoke to you when you did.
12016 : Then it all falls into place.
12017 : You must stand steadfast against the lord of the beastmen in order to set history upon its proper course.
12018 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats--not just this one--and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12019 : Master, you must take your first steps along that path.
12020 : ...Stop the Shadow Lord.
12021 : %, there are many paths that lie before you.
12022 : They opened up the moment you banished the Shadow Lord from our realm.
12023 : My dream showed me many nations, many worlds...and you were there in each one, bringing succor to those who cried out.
12024 : Then it all falls into place.
12025 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats--not just that one--and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12026 : Master, you must bring history back to its natural state.
12027 : ...And time is not exactly on our side...
12028 : %, your journeys have taken you to the far corners of our realm.
12029 : The reckoning is at hand, quicker than any of us could have prepared for.
12030 : Then it all falls into place.
12031 : In the future from which I hail, the master faced many threats and came to be known as one of Vana'diel's most storied heroes.
12032 : And [his/her] legend has already been forged.
12033 : Then we may be out of time...
12034 : And now you know everything that I do.
12035 : I'll be with you every step of your journey to conquer the Shadow Lord.
12036 : I'll do everything in my power to help you.
12037 : What the...
12038 : Lady Lion, allow me to express my gratitude.
12039 : Your honesty and strength of spirit has taken physical form.
12040 : And...you can use it?
12041 : Then you're quite welcome.
12042 : In the meantime, I'll continue my search for information about the Shadow Lord.
12043 : In the meantime, I'll continue my search for information about Escha.
12044 : Zeid, what do you plan on doing?
12045 : Gilgamesh has asked me to report back as soon as I know something, so my first order of business is to return to Norg.
12046 : Lion and Zeid, your assistance has been invaluable.
12047 : Master, I intend to learn all I can about that bell.
12048 : I await good news about the Shadow Lord's defeat.
12049 : Perhaps you should head back to Norg as well.
12050 : Until then.
12051 : The resonance between the % and the crystal reaches a crescendo!
12052 : The celestial capital of Al'Taieu welcomes you.
12053 : Would that it would do so with open arms, but the vortex slowly eats away at my home.
12054 : The capital is not the only thing to succumb. I, too, feel my energy beginning to fade.
12055 : You are eminently aware that I am not supposed to be present in this haven.
12056 : The void is compressing time, and things that once remained separate are starting to collide.
12057 : Perhaps it might be easiest to think of me as a wandering spirit.
12058 : No, you needn't offer me any explanation.
12059 : I have already heard that Siren's benevolence has guided you here.
12060 : You and Iroha have sought guidance from companions all throughout Vana'diel in order to stop the encroaching darkness.
12061 : In Iroha's future was an event called the Reckoning in which you made a decision that rang throughout the land.
12062 : As a result, Iroha was left alone, confined to Reisenjima.
12063 : A future in which Iroha was the only child of Altana left in Vana'diel.
12064 : And so you wish to beseech Altana herself for guidance...for any hint on how this bleak future can be altered.
12065 : Al'Taieu is oft referred to as the celestial capital because it has a stronger connection with Altana than anywhere on the ground below.
12066 : And I am able to commune with the terrestrial avatars and pass through the veil separating this world from the next via the crystal. Yet even I do not possess the means to reach Altana herself.
12067 : Even the most powerful forces in the lands, forces that can create whole worlds, cannot approach her.
12068 : Not even Odin.
12069 : No, such a feat requires more than anyone could hope to muster.
12070 : A power so great it could make the five crystals whole once more.
12071 : Yet did the future Siren not mention that a key may yet lie in Reisenjima?
12072 : I find no cause to doubt her, particularly in light of what I have discovered.
12073 : What if we could create a crystal that could banish the Emptiness?
12074 : %, you have traversed the cavernous maws, so I need not remind you that you have visited worlds other than our own.
12075 : These worlds exist in parallel, and each has its own past, present, and future.
12076 : Tartarus, a place known by a select few in Eastern Ulbuka, is one such world.
12077 : Countless years have I spent ensuring balance between these worlds, that they never interfere with each other.
12078 : From each I have drawn but a small fraction of crystal energy...
12079 : ...And have accumulated enough light to create another towering mothercrystal for Vana'diel.
12080 : Inquire about what? Drawing crystal energy. Accumulating light.
12081 : It is precisely as I have said. I have undertaken this plan since long before Iroha arrived here in this era.
12082 : This plan is to create a new crystal in Reisenjima, the holy land of the Far East, and create a safe haven from the darkness. A plan, I add, that requires an inordinate amount of time to bring to fruition.
12083 : Iroha's presence or absence makes no difference.
12084 : The result would be the same.
12085 : %, if what I said overlaps with anything Siren told you, then you may have just found another piece of the puzzle.
12086 : But what this Reckoning that Iroha speaks of is, I know not.
12087 : ...
12088 : You are the Warrior of the Crystal...and are destined to become the Warrior of Light.
12089 : You will coalesce thousands of points of light into a single shining star, your radiance casting out the darkness.
12090 : And you will become more than a mere Warrior.
12091 : Master, all the grand adventures you have embarked on led you here.
12092 : You have guided us all to the final struggle against an unthinkable future.
12093 : Vanquish the darkness that lies within you!
12094 : You have already banished the darkness that lies within you, and have but to fill yourself with sacred light.
12095 : Even in the most trying of times, there is one virtue that humanity does not abandon: hope.
12096 : It is your calling to keep that hope alive.
12097 : Iroha is the only one who can aid you in making your final decision.
12098 : And there is one more thing.
12099 : I would have you aid me should you feel that my plan is the proper course of action.
12100 : All I have worked to collect these many years is slowly being absorbed into the world known as Tartarus.
12101 : One born of that land has caught wind of my plan and seeks to undermine it.
12102 : Seek out the one whose dominion over magic is absolute...
12103 : Please...I beg you...
12104 : Ah, Master. Excellent timing.
12105 : Come! To the world of the gods!
12106 : Meet...Altana...
12107 : Teleport to where? Al'Taieu. The Empyreal Paradox. Nowhere.
12108 : Teleport to where? Al'Taieu. Reisenjima. Nowhere.
