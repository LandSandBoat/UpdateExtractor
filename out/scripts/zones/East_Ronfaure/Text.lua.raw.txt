6863 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6864 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6865 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6866 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.

6868 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6869 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6870 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6871 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6872 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6873 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6874 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6875 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6876 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6877 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6878 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6879 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6880 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6881 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6882 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6883 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6884 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6885 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6886 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6887 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6888 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6889 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6890 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6891 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6892 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6893 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6894 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6895 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6896 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6897 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6898 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6899 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6900 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6901 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6902 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...

6936 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
6937 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.

6952 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6953 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
6954 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
6955 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
6956 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
6957 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6958 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
6959 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
6960 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
6961 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!

6963 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6964 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
6965 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
6966 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
6967 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6968 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6969 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6970 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6971 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6972 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.

7361 : I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...
7362 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
7363 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
7364 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7365 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7366 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7367 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7368 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7369 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7370 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7371 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7372 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7373 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7374 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7375 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7376 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7377 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7378 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7379 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7380 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7381 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7382 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7383 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.

7423 : My name is Andelain. As part of my devotions, I come here each day to pray.
7424 : During this time, I may eat only three % a day for nourishment. No more, no less. And no other food may I eat.
7425 : Thanks be to the Goddess in her benevolence!
7426 : I am currently undergoing devotions, and as such, am not allowed to take alms from those on the road. I am sorry, but I cannot accept this.
7427 : May the Gates of Paradise open to all...
7428 : I appreciate your offer, but I only need one %. Thank you for your kindness.
7429 : It has been a long time since I last came to this place. I sense more fiends than before.
7430 : I hear talk of...him...and of the crystals. I am worried.
7431 : I saw Prince Trion near the entrance to the cave. Luckily, he did not spy me.

7433 : After I ran from the chateau that day, I thought I would never return. But it seems I am left with no choice.

7435 : It has been a long time since I was last here. As I thought, our enemies have grown in number.
7436 : I searched many places, hoping to understand the beastmen's plans, yet this was the first time I had seen such a fiend.
7437 : I must discover what it is, and tell King Destin without delay.
7438 : Yesterday, I scoured Ordelle's Caves. I had been many times during my training, and always found it a damp, gloomy place.
7439 : I remember him telling me once, long ago, that they had another name: the Body Caves, for that is the form they take.
7440 : But that white light I saw in the waterfall basin within the caves... What could it have been?
7441 : I am currently surveying the camps at Davoi, to the south of Jugner Forest. It is the Orcs' stronghold, and all we do here is at great peril to ourselves.
7442 : I spoke briefly to the scout near the entrance. He is a Temple Knight, I believe. A solo post in the heart of enemy territory is perilous indeed.
7443 : But, one can become a true knight only by walking a long road of danger. Strength is forged only through hardship.
7444 : But he grew up without any hardship, so he cannot truly know another's pain. He would not weep, even if his troops were slaughtered on the battlefield.
7445 : I often wonder about that white glow I saw in the waterfall basin in Davoi, but I have much to do, and little time for such dalliances.
7446 : The water sparkles in the light.

7460 : These woods of Ronfaure have long been hunting grounds of the Elvaan royalty, and as such are maintained well.
7461 : I came here to see the bravery of the participants in the great autumn hunt, but sadly it was a somber ceremonial affair with little to see.
7462 : I am certain that this stems from the choice of quarry: no longer do they hunt fowl or deer. Rather, giant sheep are released expressly for the hunt.
7463 : As I write this, I pray that the gluttonous grazing of these voracious sheep does not destroy the delicate balance of life in these woods.

7647 : (Hop...) Er, ah... There's always next year, so promise me you won't go jump-wumping off any bridges, okay?
7648 : The [orange/1/2/3/red/red/blue/blue/yellow/yellow/green/green/indigo/indigo/violet/violet] light... I can feel its power run through me.
7649 : Come, %.  Follow me...
7650 : Carbuncle vanished off in the direction of the La Theine Plateau.
7651 : Carbuncle vanished off to another area in the La Theine Plateau.
7652 : The % jumps in your hands.
7653 : Ahahahahaha! I can sense the power of the ring! Get yourself moving [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7654 : Ahahahahaha! Don't slow down now, slacker! The readings are coming from the [north/northeast/east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest]!
7655 : Ahahahahaha! You're getting close now! I can feel the ring's power from the next area!
7656 : Ahahahahaha! You're almost on top of it! It's somewhere in this area!
7657 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7658 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!
7659 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7660 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip the %, kupo!
7661 : I can't work my moogle magic while you're involved in other events, kupo!
7662 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7663 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo!
7664 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7665 : You won't be able to hurt those harbingers of harm with %. You must equip % or %, kupo!
7666 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
7667 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
7668 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
7669 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
7670 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7671 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
7672 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
7673 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
7674 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
7675 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
7676 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
7677 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
7678 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
7679 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
7680 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7681 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
7682 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
7683 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
7684 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
7685 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
7686 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
7687 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
7688 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
7689 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
7690 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
7691 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
7692 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.
7693 : KILL
7698 : Kupo-whoa-whoa there, pardner! Care to saddle up and help us rustle up a couple o' wild buffalo? 'Cause we've got a stampede on our hands, I reckon!
7699 : Lend a hand? <Skedaddle away.> A stampede, you say? I reckon I will.
7700 : Well, sit down and grab a sarsaparilla, and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. You see, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) ain't too popular among the townsfolk these days, and they've been talkin' with their wallets by not sendin' too many gold nuggets our way, if you catch my drift.
7701 : But seein' as how we moogles are an enterprisin' bunch, we done hatched ourselves a plan, y'hear?
7702 : A plan we call... The Buffalo Bonanza Ranch! Yeeeeee-hawww!!!
7703 : Rustle up a herd of the most darn-tootin' fearsome buffalo from over and yonder, throw a fence around 'em, and you done got yerself the rip-roarin'est dude ranch this side of the Rio Rafeloux, kupo!
7704 : Set up a saloon on the side serving scrumptious buffalo burgers, and you've got contented customers filling our moogle coffers with mucho dinero... Comprende?
7705 : That there was the plan, pardner.
7706 : So we lassoed up a herd o' ill-tempered buffalo from the mountains up north, and were leadin' our li'l dogies back this-a-way to town...
7707 : And that's when we hit a bit o' a snag.
7708 : Dagnabbit if I know where they came from, but a swarm of confounded chigoes done showed up!
7709 : Now y'see, these buffalo come from the mountains, and ain't never seen the likes of no chigoes before. They raised a right ruckus, and next thing y'know, we done had a stampede on our hands!
7710 : Y'ever see a stampedin' buffalo? Even our moogle hypnosis did 'bout as much good as a poke in the ear with a rusty cattle prod, kupo!
7711 : That's where you come in, pardner. What say you saddle up and help us moogles round up these beasties?
7712 : For each buffalo you capture, we'll give you one o' these here bovine brands. Collect 'em and mount 'em and you'll be eligible to win a veritable bonanza o' special prizes!
7713 : looks at you with puppy-dog eyes...
7714 : Now, I'd do this myself and save y'all the trouble, but jus' look at me... One kick from a stampedin' buffalo and my puny moogle body'd be flung right to the other side o' Vana'diel, I reckon!
7715 : Y'all got nothin' to worry 'bout, though. As big and sturdy as you are, I reckon you'd only fly to just over yonder a-ways.
7716 : And as an added bonus, you can trade the bovine brands you've earned for a whole kit 'n caboodle o' Buffalo Bonanza Ranch goods and prizes! Yeeeeee-haw, kupo!
7717 : So how's about it, pardner?
7718 : gazes at % with a steely glint in his eye.
7719 : Saddle up? I think I'll pass. Sure. Yeee-haw!
7720 : Yippie ki-yi-yay!!! Much obliged, pardner!
7721 : If your cow-herdin' skills are up to the task, we'll stamp you some bovine brands on this here sheet.
7722 : Once you've racked up your share o' brands, just mosey back on over here to claim your prizes!
7723 : So sharpen your spurs, and when you're ready, herd up the buffalo and lead them to the moogle cowhand in area [G-9/I-8/G-9/H-9/H-6/I-7], kupo!
7724 : Ready to go? Tell me more about the buffalo. How about some help, pardner? Giddy-up!
7725 : All right, now go rustle yerself up some buffalo! Yee-haw!
7726 : The big beastly ones are the bulls, the bosses o' the herds. The midsized ones are the mother cows, and the li'l-bittiest ones are the baby calves.
7727 : The calves are sweet little thangs. Don't even have to hypnotize 'em; they'll follow their mother's scent just 'bout anywhere.
7728 : By the by, we got ourselves a bottle o' Eau de Buffalo here. We moogle cowpokes use it to disguise ourselves with the mother buffalo's scent. It's only got #  [dose/doses] left, but they're all yours, pardner.
7729 : 'Course, there ain't no need to fret if it runs out. Just brush yerself up against one of the mama cows and you'll get a natural shot of Eau de Buffalo just like that.
7730 : But you'd best be careful, 'cause they be some hot-tempered heifers, y'hear? You'll be wantin' to sneak up on them from behind, all careful-like, to avoid their charge.
7731 : As for the bulls, I'm quakin' in my boots just thinkin' 'bout 'em. They're the nastiest, most foul-tempered beasts this ol' cowhand's ever laid eyes upon.  You'll be wantin' to steer clear of 'em and stick to roundin' up the cows and calves, kupo.
7732 : And don't you be forgettin' that these buffaloes, they always act as a herd, y'hear? So don't go mixin' the herds, or we'll have a right ruckus on our hands.
7733 : And you'd best take care to keep the chigoes away, too. One li'l bite from them and the buffalo will really start goin' loco, I reckon.
7734 : With this here bottle o' Eau de Buffalo, we can make you smell just like one o' the buffalo mamas. It's runnin' low, though, so you'll want to be usin' it wisely, I reckon.
7735 : Apply the scent? Not now. Sure.
7736 : A dab or two o' buffalo sweat, a dab or two o' milk, and...kupo!
7737 : You now smell strongly of buffalo!
7738 : There [is/are] # remaining dose[/s] of Eau de Buffalo.
7739 : Sorry, pardner, we done exhausted our supply. Reckon you'll just have to do it the hard way...
7740 : That's a cryin' shame, pardner.
7741 : If'n you change your mind, just holler. We'll be here 'till the cows come home.
7742 : The buffalo scent is about to wear off!
7743 : The buffalo scent has worn off!
7744 : Well, I'll be darned...you done rustled yerself some buffalo! Giddy on up, 'cause the Buffalo Bonanza Ranch is back in business!
7745 : You got # bovine  [brand/brands] stamped on your %! Yeee-haw!
7746 : Tarnation! If you ain't the greatest buffalo herder this ol' cowpoke's ever seen! You've earned yerself some extra brands, pardner.
7747 : You've wrangled yerself the following buffalo, pardner:
7748 : % %
7749 : % %.
7750 : Feelin' a bit tuckered out? You ain't caught yerself a single buffalo yet.
7751 : Ain't got the time for that now, pardner... We've got a stampede on our hands! We'd be much obliged if you could help us rustle up these buffalo, pardner. Go talk to my compadre by the city gates if yer interested.
7752 : Sorry, pardner, but you ain't earned enough bovine brands for that.
7753 : How goes it, pardner? Keep on herdin'. Ask about the buffalo. Get the mother's scent. Mosey on home.
7754 : So long, pardner. We've still got ourselves some loose buffalo, so do come back again, y'hear?
7755 : You've got yerself # bovine  [brand/brands], pardner.
7756 : Trade in for a prize? Not now. % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands). % (# brands).
7757 : Trade # brands for %? No thanks. Giddy-up!
7758 : Here we've got a special beverage made from buffalo milk, with a dash o' moogle magic. Darned if I know how it works, but one swig o' this and you'll up and transform into any critter you touch. You'll be best buddies with the buffalo in no time, pardner!
7759 : This here's a belt crafted from the finest buffalo rawhide, soaked in buffalo milk, and left to dry out under the burnin' sun.  Got a bit of a foul odor, but it works just like %.
7760 : With this here stylish mantle, not only will you be the most dashin' cowhand for miles, you'll be able to dodge those blasted buffalo charges a couple'a times, to boot!
7761 : This here's a limited-edition Buffalo Bonanza Ranch cowhorn. It's just a li'l decorative doodad, so it don't make no sound, but word has it that it can make you as rich as a gold mine!
7762 : Handle this hot and heavy new waist attire straight from the heavy horns of the belligerent buffalo Toro himself!
7763 : Handle this hot and heavy new waist attire straight from the heavy horns of the belligerent buffalo Miura himself!
7764 : Our wonderful workers of hide have fashioned this fantastic cap that can turn you into a buffalo calf, kupo!
7765 : This conspicuously convenient cap was crafted by a masterful Moogle weaver and inexplicably increases the amount of time you can ride your mount, kupo!
7766 : There's big trouble, kupo! Our most reliable moogle intelligence reports that an odious one-eyed demon known as a Pyracmon is using the Harvest Festival masquerade as a cover and trying to infiltrate the city even as we speak!
7767 : We've been trying to warn people, but the bigwigs and guardsmen won't even give us poor little moogles the time of day. But you believe us...don't you, kind adventurer?
7768 : Help a moogle in need? But of course! I think I'll pass.
7769 : <Sigh> And here I had a devilishly delightful Harvest Festival costume handmade just for you... Oh well, looks like it's going back in storage until next year, kupo.
7770 : Splendid, kupo! The first thing you'll need to do is eliminate the Pyracmon's malevolent minions, the wraith bats!
7771 : These dastardly critters attacked us and sucked the moogle magic right out of us, kupo! Without it, even the sharpest steel won't so much as scratch the Pyracmon!
7772 : For each bat you banish, we'll recover some of our magical powers, so lay waste to as many flying foes as you can muster!
7773 : Report back here after that, and we'll channel that magic and whip up an incantation that will allow you to vanquish the Pyracmon!
7774 : In the meantime, I'll use the meager remains of our magic to enchant you with a spell to aid in your battle against the wraith bats, kupo.
7775 : There you go!  Now have at those winged vermin!
7776 : Back to help us rid the land of the vile Pyracmon?
7777 : Need help with anything? Just say the word, kupo!
7778 : Ask the moogle for help? I'm fine, thanks. I'm ready to take on the Pyracmon. I give up.
7779 : Wow, looks like you managed to recover oodles of magic from those bats. Oodles, kupo! This should make for a potent incantation indeed!
7780 : Mind you, this enchantment won't last forever; if it runs out, you'll need to nab some more magic from the bats again. Now go send that ghastly Pyracmon back to the foul depths whence it came!
7781 : Well, I'm sure a mighty adventurer like you has better things to do than help a poor little Moogle, kupo... Still, the Pyracmon won't rest until he's carried out his nefarious deeds, so do come back if you have a change of heart!
7782 : Wow, you made mincemeat out of that Pyracmon! Just watching the battle sent chills up my little wings, kupo! You're the savior of the town and of all mooglekind!
7783 : Though it may be unworthy of a great hero such as yourself, please accept this as a humble token of our moogle gratitude!
7784 : For all we know, the Pyracmon is still lurking, just waiting for another chance to creep into our ranks. Should it return, please lend us your strength again, kupo!
7785 : By the by, have you heard that some eerie and enchanting effulgences have emerged around the realm, kupo?
7786 : Each one mumbles and mutters like a misanthropic miscreant, but pay them no mind. Well now, may mirth and merriment multiply for you during this celebratory season, kupo!
7787 : My, my, my... What an intriguing spell you've learned, wayfarer.
7788 : Yi-yi-yikes! Another pernicious puppet of Pyracmon is poised to pulverize us, kupo!
7789 : Pyracmon? Hmm, that moniker may be gathering dust in the corner of my mind, but I do still recall it...possibly from some brittle tome written eons ago.
7790 : It's the exorcist who made a deal with a de--
7791 : Yes, yes, yes...now I remember. It is the name of a youthful yet promising exorcist who formed a perilous pact with a demon, only to become one himself.
7792 : An exorcist who...hey! Don't put the chocobo before the cart! I don't remember selling my soul to a demon like that ecclesiastical abomination!
7793 : Of course, but let us not dwell on trifling details. You there, adventurer. How about bestowing that boon upon us in a deal of your own? We shall certainly make it worth your while.
7794 : Ay yai yai! I ardently advise against accepting an appeal as artful as this, kupo! You sobbed sanguineous streams in your quest to procure this potent magic--you shouldn't just give it away!
7795 : Bestow the boon upon yon bats? Verily. Nay.
7796 : How thoughtful of you to grace us with your presence--and your magic--yet again.
7797 : I've never seen anyone go about business as slow as you! Was your mother a tortoise or something? Anyway, hurry up and give us that magic effect before we die of old age!
7798 : That spell...equivalent to # mandragora-power... We must have it.
7799 : What an exhilarating sensation! That last batch of magic was as potent as an Ahriman in rut. Should you chance to find yourself with a sorcerous abundance again, we will always welcome you with spread wings.
7800 : I just know you're holding out on us, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...for now. Next time, try stocking up on more of that magic first.
7801 : I knew you'd give us what we needed. Have this in return.
7802 : Sordid scryers, %! You just parted ways with all the magnificent magic you managed to muster, kupo!
7803 : Well...I suppose there's still some enhancing magic left to help you rout those reprobate wraith bats... Let's get back to business before that brutish Pyracmon can ruin the rest of the Harvest Festival, kupo.
7804 : I am literally spellbound, adventurer! Your contributions have surpassed our expectations. Take this as thanks from the bottom of our black hearts.
7805 : It turns out the energy contained in these so-called Middle Lands isn't so middling after all. At least it'll be of use once our preparations are underway.
7806 : Indubitably. While we must bid farewell to this continent, you can always use that headgear to fly over for a reunion.
7807 : Hyah, hyah, hyah! How gullible you are! You may be well versed in the arts of magic, but your sense of humor still leaves much to be desired.
7808 : ...Until next time.
7809 : What in the wide world was with those bizarre bats, kupo? I assumed they were allies of that apocalyptic abomination Pyracmon, but it seems my intuition was incorrect...
7810 : But based on the variety of their vexing vocal vibrations, I'd say there were three theurgists controlling those preternatural parasites. All that's beside the point, I suppose. Now we've got to start over from scratch, kupo...
7811 : This trace amount leaves our thirst for magic unquenched. The pact cannot be completed unless you return with the ordained measure.
7812 : What do you expect us to do with these spectral dregs!? This is nothing! Nothing! Don't come back here again until you've obtained an amount decent enough to study!
7813 : Your total...only equivalent to # mandragora-power... We require more...
7814 : How...disappointing. Then I shall take your reply to mean you do not require a certain miraculous artifact we had been saving for you.
7815 : ...Fine! See if I care! In fact, I care so little that I'm gonna put a curse on you for refusing to help us, so there!
7816 : ...Of course you won't now...but you will eventually.
7817 : Whew, for a moment I was positively petrified about your progression on this particular peregrination. Now that that's that, though, let's go pummel Pyracmon, puko! Er, kupo!
7818 : Such arcane power could be put to much more productive uses than banishing that fairy tale of an exorcist...
7819 : Should you take the time to charge that spell once more, we would certainly make it worth your while.
7820 : Nothing seems out of the ordinary here, yet you cannot help but feel ill at ease...
7821 : Kupopopo!? According to my observations, some occult object has emerged next to that eerie effulgence. Whatever could it be, kupo?
7822 : A field manual has been placed here by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.). Useful information pertaining to various topics on field operations fills its pages.
7823 : What will you do? Nothing. Read about individual training. Review current training regime. Cancel current training regime. Read about elite training. Read about field support.
7824 : Which page? I've changed my mind. Page 1. Page 2. Page 3. Page 4. Page 5.
7825 : The information on this page instructs you to defeat the following:

10925 : You've recovered one of the long-lost mog tablets! You should share the news of your discovery with the Explorer Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens.
10926 : Greetings, adventurer! You've heard the tale of the mog tablets, haven't you? If any of them turn up in your travels, promise you'll let me know, kupo!
10927 : [Greetings/Happy Vana'versary], my adventuring friend! Thanks to your efforts, the mog tablets have been recovered, and their magic freed to spread happiness and joy across the realm! You are truly a friend to all mooglekind, kupo!
10928 : Oh no! What a shame, kupo! The mog tablets that were recovered have been scattered to the ends of Vana'diel once more...
10929 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. List of tablets. Nothing.
10930 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Collected tablets. The current Super Kupower. Nothing.
10931 : Ask about something? What's a mog tablet? The history of mog tablets. Nothing.
10932 : What's a mog tablet!? What's a mog tablet, you say!? Why, only the most awesome, amazing artifact in the annals of moogle history, that's what, kupo!
10933 : There's eleven of them in all, to be exact, scattered to the far reaches of Vana'diel and just waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers like you!
10934 : What happens if you find them? I thought you'd never ask, kupo! Each tablet is inscribed with an ancient moogle poem of joy, and legend has it that if all are found, the ancient moogle magic of King Kupofried the Great will be released once more, spreading joy and happiness through all the land!
10935 : We explorer moogles have made it our life's work to recover the tablets and unlock their powers. But with these short legs and little-bitty wings, we can't do it alone, kupo!
10936 : There! I've whipped up a spell that will instantly transport any tablets you find back here to me. Come back if you find anything, and happy exploring, kupo!
10937 : Just sit right back and I'll tell you the tale, kupo. Many, many ages past, we moogles had our own glorious kingdom. It was truly the peak of moogle civilization, a veritable golden age for all mooglekind!
10938 : The seventh king of this great nation was the wise and kindly King Kupofried, a masterful magician famed as the father of the fantastic moogle magic that survives to this very day, kupo!
10939 : In his later years, King Kupofried embarked on what would become the greatest work of his illustrious reign. Seeking to pass down the prosperity of his kingdom to future generations, he inscribed eleven incantations of moogle joy and happiness onto eleven stone tablets.
10940 : Sadly, the kindly king's intentions went unappreciated by his selfish sons and daughters, and many a fierce feud broke out over who would inherit these relics, kupo...
10941 : King Kupofried was greatly dismayed. How could the poems that he had composed out of pure love and joy become the root of such strife?
10942 : In his despair, the king commanded his minion bats to scatter the tablets to the far corners of the world, where they would be seen by moogle eyes no more.
10943 : Alas! I only wanted my children to be happy, kupo, he lamented, and flew away on his tiny yet majestic wings, never to be seen in his kingdom again.
10944 : Left without its wise monarch, the once-glorious moogle kingdom fractured into warring tribes, falling into unrest...and, eventually, ruin. A tragic tale, don't you think, kupo?
10945 : We explorer moogles are the proud descendants of King Kupofried, living only to bring our last great monarch's unrealized dream to fruition. We will--we must!--find the mog tablets and bring true joy and happiness to this world!
10946 : Let's see... It appears that # moogle [tablet has/tablets have] already been found, kupo.

10951 : No tablet has been discovered there yet. It's not too late for you to stake your claim, kupo!
10952 : Oh, glorious day! All eleven mog tablets have been recovered and restored to their rightful place at the altar of King Kupofried!
10953 : Can you feel the ancient moogle magic in the air? You can now bask in the benefits of this Super Kupower...
10954 : Thrifty Transit! A special treat for the cost-conscious adventurer! For a limited time, all survival guide costs are eliminated, and you are able to teleport between nearby cities for a small fee, kupo!

10959 : Myriad Mystery Boxes! What's this, kupo? Mysterious boxes have been sighted all over the realm! What genius could have devised such commendable creations?

10961 : Boundary Buster! Trust in Signet and you can never go wrong, kupo! It's time to take to the field and vanquish a veritable army of enemies, for any Conquest Points you receive will be duly doubled!
10962 : Bountiful Bazaar! Trade routes are bustling with unprecedented traffic and peddlers' carts are overflowing with objects now that regional goods are available to merchants across the realm, kupo!
10963 : Swift Shoes! This is just the ticket for today's busy adventurer! For a limited time, provided that you're fully rested and healed, your legs will carry you with the speed of a chocobo!
10964 : Crystal Caboodle! Signet is now better than ever! Collect crystals from beastmen-controlled areas...and maybe even clusters from other areas!
10966 : Be warned that our moogle magic is concentrated around this altar. If you venture to far-off lands, the Super Kupowers will be unable to protect you...
10967 : What? What about the past, you say? Of course the magic won't travel through time. What a strange question, kupo...
10968 : But not an altogether pointless, one. The powers of thirtfy transit do seem to apply across the space-time continuum, kupo.
10969 : The whole system is filled with mysteries.
10970 : Oh, it's you! It's really you! The brave adventurer who discovered one of our mog tablets!
10971 : It's a pleasure, an honor to meet you, kupo! We have a special prize to reward you for your efforts. If you'll just sign right here...
10972 : Sign for the moogle? Sure. I don't think so.
10973 : Oh, thank you, [Mister/Miss]...%! A truly heroic name, kupo!
10974 : As a reward for your efforts, please have this! Many thanks, and [safe travels/Happy Vana'versary], kupo!
10975 : What? You won't? That's a shame, kupo. I had a special prize here just for you, but without your signature, I'll just have to hold on to it...
10976 : If you change your mind, come back quickly. The mog tablets will be scattered to the wind again at any moment, kupo...

10997 : What will you do? Undertake training. Hear an explanation. What's the qualifying time? What's the fastest time? Nothing.
10998 : Fantastic! But, oh...it seems you don't have %. Well, that's just too bad!
10999 : It'd be my pleasure! Here goes nothing! Ahem! The Smilebringer Boot Camp was established for two purposes, the first being the ongoing training and conditioning of smilebringers. The second--and this is where you come in, yay!--is for us to scout hopefuls from the adventurer community to join our jovial ranks!
11000 : The population of vicious monsters has grown in recent years, you see. And because of this, more smilebringers were being--<gasp!>--injured in the line of duty than ever before.
11001 : But we weren't going to take that sitting down, no siree. The day we smilebringers stop doing our job--that is, bringing smiles--is the day the world ends!
11002 : Whatever the predicament, and no matter the size of the ruszor-inflicted gash wound, we will--we must--pull through...for the sake of the children!
11003 : With these heart-warming ideals in mind, the Smilebringer Boot Camp was established. Ta-da! Smilebringers graduating from this camp are better equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of these unstable times we live in.
11004 : The rules are as simple as sunshine. Smilebringer's honor! When I give you the word, run to each of the checkpoints we've set up in the area. Smile helpers are posted at each, so you can't miss them!
11005 : Talk to the smile helpers and they'll confirm your passage. The route you take is completely up to you--just be sure you don't miss any checkpoints. You got all that? Hmmm?
11006 : I'll mark each smile helper's location on your map beforehand, so you don't need to worry about getting lost.
11007 : Once you've finished visiting all the checkpoints, you have to--you guessed it!--come back and report to me. It's okay, I won't bite!
11008 : What I will do, though, is tell you how quickly you completed the course. After all, to a smilebringer, speed is everything. Some folks run faster with a fell beast hot on their tail, but we smilebringers need no more than the thought of a child's laughter to spur us on! Zoom zoom!
11009 : Oh, and I should mention that at this time of year, we're collecting donations in the form of a small fee to participate in the training. All proceeds go towards presents for the children during the Starlight Celebration. Thank you for your cooperation!
11010 : One more thing you should know. If you venture out of the area, the training will automatically be canceled. But I can trust you not to walk out on your favorite smile sergeant, right? Hmmm?
11011 : So far, the fastest time in this area is # minute[/s] # second[/s]. Wow! And the name of the greased lightning who set this record is %. Don't be forgetting that, you hear?
11012 : We'd like all participants to complete this area's course within # minute[/s] # second[/s]. A piece of cake for a strapping young [wolf/vixen] like you, surely! And if you manage a time quicker than # minute[/s] # second[/s]...then you and I had better trade places! Oh, that would be so much fun, wouldn't it?
11013 : Awww... You've made this smile sergeant very sad... But I'll be glued to this spot, because I just know you'll be back to turn my frown upside down! Yes siree!
11014 : At this time of year, we're collecting a donation of # gil from each participant. All proceeds go towards presents for the children. Oh, won't you think of the children? <Sniffle>...
11015 : Give to the children? I live to give! Charity begins at home.
11016 : But of course! First, I'll need you to lend me your %... Oh, don't pout! I'll give it back as soon as I'm done, promise!
11017 : You'll find each of the ten smile helpers by the points I've indicated. Don't forget to talk with every one of them or it won't count, okay?
11018 : There! I've marked each smile helper's location for you. If you ever lose your bearings in the middle of a run, just open up your map and everything will be aaall right. Trust me! <Wink>
11019 : So, are you ready-steady? [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] level training...GO! Come on, pump those legs like there's no tomorrow!
11020 : Since the Starlight Celebration has ended, we've had to make a few changes.
11021 : But the Smilebringer Boot Camp will be available for off-season conditioning the whole year round, so come back whenever you're in the mood. I'll be waiting for you!
11022 : Oh, you're back! I was afraid we'd lost you to some foul creature prowling the wilderness. Let's start from the top, shall we?
11023 : Oh, what're you doing here? Aren't you in the middle of a run right now? Couldn't stand to be parted from your favorite smile sergeant, maybe? Teehee!
11024 : What will you do? Hear an explanation. Where're the smile helpers again? Cancel the training. Nothing.
11025 : Awww... These rivulets of tears streaming down my face... B-but it's okay... You have your own reasons for quitting, and I understand... <Sob>
11026 : Welcome back! Let's check your time, shall we? You cleared the course in # minute[/s] # second[/s].
11027 : Oh my Goddess! You've set a new record for this area! Hooray! Somebody, break out the fireworks!
11028 : You've successfully qualified! Yay! Here's a little something to commemorate this marvelous achievement.
11029 : You obtain %!
11030 : Ah, just the knowledge that there're capable adventurers like you around helps me sleep better at night. The children...they're in good hands... <Sob>
11031 : You did just fine, but don't be resting on those laurels, you hear? As we smilebringers say, there's always a bigger, brighter smile to be had!
11032 : Oh no! I'm afraid your time falls short of qualification! As much as I want to give you a passing grade, headquarters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
11033 : Oh no! Please don't be mad, but...I forgot to record your time. I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this scatterbrain of a smile sergeant...
11034 : It might surprise you to learn this, but even the toughest--grrrrrr!--and roughest of us smilebringers need rest and relaxation. Oh, wipe that grin off your face! I knew you wouldn't believe me!
11035 : Aaanyway! What I meant to say is, work hard, play hard is our motto, and it applies to boot camp participants, too. After you complete a run with a qualifying time--yay!--you're required to rest up until the next day (Vana'diel time).
11036 : Awww, seeing the way you're simply bursting with enthusiasm makes me want to cry tears of joy. But you have to be cruel to be kind. No more training until tomorrow, young [man/lady]! No siree!

11128 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
11129 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
11130 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
11131 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
11132 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
11133 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
11134 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
11135 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
11136 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
11137 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
11138 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
11139 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
11140 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
11141 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
11142 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
11143 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
11144 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
11145 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
11146 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
11147 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
11148 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
11149 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
11150 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
11151 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
11152 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
11153 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
11154 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
11155 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
11156 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
11157 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
11158 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
11159 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
11160 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
11161 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
11162 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
11163 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
11164 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
11165 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
11166 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
11167 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
11168 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
11169 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
11170 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%
