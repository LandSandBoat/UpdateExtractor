162 : Thirty years ago, the three nations--Windurst, Bastok and San d'Oria--sent an expedition to investigate this cursed land.
163 : The Galka swordsman Raogrimm, the Hume monk Cornelia, the Hume warrior Ulrich...
164 : The Elvaan knight Francmage, the Tarutaru white mage Iru-Kuiru, and the Mithra ranger Rabntah were the members of the expedition.
165 : All of them were great heroes of their people. But they had to cut the expedition short when an accident claimed two of their group.
166 : Raogrimm and Cornelia were the ones who died in the accident. The others are said to have suffered violent deaths themselves after their return.
167 : Perhaps they had awakened the curse that was said to be buried in this land... They may have called forth the ancient bane.
168 : The ancient bane... The Shadow of Darkness--an image of the Shadow Lord--told us...that our kinds were the ones that had awakened him.
169 : That he would spread the bane that will destroy Vana'diel from our cowardice, rage, envy, arrogance, and apathy...
170 : His image? I see...
171 : The great bane will devour the fair land of Vana'diel...
172 : The ancient seal will be broken, awakening nightmares of ages past.
173 : The blood of innocents will soak the earth, and the world will fall into fear and despair.
174 : But as one bright star shines through the clouds at night, and as one song rings clear above the roar of beasts, we hold to one hope in these darkest of times.
175 : That they will come, with the wisdom of ages and the strength of thousands, to deliver us from our plight. We await the awakening of the Warriors of the Crystal.
176 : That's an old song... It's called The Warriors of the Crystal, isn't it?
177 : Just an old wives' tale. I do not know why I mentioned it. I must go. I do not expect to find much, but something troubles me...

6985 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
6986 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.
6987 : I'm halfway there...maybe?
6988 : [/Hmm./This is a good pace!/Hmm./Well, well./Just a little more./Come on!/I'm past the halfway point./Just a little more!/Well, well.] [/Not too much further to my next level./Not much more to my next level!/Still need a little more experience for my next level./It appears my next level is not far off at all./My next level is not too far away./I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!/Not long now until I gain another level./My next level is almost within sight!/It appears my next level is not far off at all.]
6989 : Hmm. Not too much further to my next level.
6990 : This is a good pace! Not much more to my next level!
6991 : Hmm. Still need a little more experience for my next level.
6992 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
6993 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
6994 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
6995 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
6996 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
6997 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
6998 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
6999 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
7000 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7001 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.
7002 : It can't be so far off, now...can it?
7003 : [/Hmm./I'm almost there./Not long now./Any time now./Well, what do you know?/Woohoo!/This is encouraging./I love this time!/Any time now.] [/I should be gaining a level soon./I can almost taste my next level!/My next level is just around the corner./My next level is very close, indeed./I think I'll be gaining a level soon./I'll be leveling up really soon!/I should be gaining a level any time now./I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!/My next level is very close, indeed.]
7004 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
7005 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
7006 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
7007 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7008 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
7009 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7010 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7011 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7012 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7013 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7014 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7015 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7016 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7017 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7018 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7019 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7020 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7021 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7022 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7023 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7024 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7025 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7026 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7027 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7028 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7029 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7030 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7031 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7032 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7033 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7034 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7035 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7036 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7037 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7038 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7039 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7040 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7041 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7042 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7043 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7044 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7045 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7046 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7047 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7048 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7049 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7050 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7051 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7052 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7053 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7054 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7055 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7056 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7057 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7058 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7059 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
7060 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7092 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? Why, we have only vanquished # [foe/foes] so far.
7093 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.

7103 : Defeated enemies? That was number #.
7104 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
7105 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...

7107 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7108 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7109 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7110 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7111 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7112 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7113 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7114 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7115 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7116 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7117 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
7118 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
7119 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
7120 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7121 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
7122 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
7123 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
7124 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7125 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7126 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7127 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7128 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
7129 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
7130 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7319 : You have a feeling that your moogle friend has been through this way...
7320 : You suspect that the scenery around here would be to a moogle's liking...
7321 : You have a vague feeling that a moogle would enjoy traversing this terrain...
7322 : You have a hunch that this area would be favored by moogles...
7323 : Your chocobo is pulling at the bit. You sense that it is leading you to the [east/southeast/south/southwest/west/northwest/north/northeast].

7340 : Please hand zis back to ze Rhinosterie research team outside on ze Beaucedine Glacier. Zey should be able to restore ze lost magique.
7341 : Ze ruins of Fei'Yin are incredibly ancientaru. It is a place zat crawls with bizarre magical creatures and, like zis golem here, it is not known who, or what, created them.
7342 : If you battle certain magical creatures, it may have an adverse effectaru on zat magique tome.
7343 : You came all ze way from Windurst? Well now, zat's quite a journey.
7344 : Ah! You've succeeded! C'est magnifique! We've had all sorts of bother-wother trying to get Doctor Shantotto's magique here intact.

7349 : Ah, never mind... Be extra careful on your way home, mon ami.
7350 : The occupant does not wish to be disturbed without good reason.
7351 : A change has occurred in the %.
7352 : You...
7353 : What is this? You are here to complete my task for me?
7354 : So, Michea and Gwill are... However, I don't understand why you're here. Are you a new student?
7355 : Whatever the reason... Let me inform you of what our master would like accomplished.
7356 : In one of the Orc settlements in Davoi, % can be found. You must enter one of their tents to find it.
7357 : Our master wants us to bring this to him. What, you ask, is this item for? Only our master can answer that question. However, I think it may have to do with my sisters...
7358 : At any rate, that is all I know. As for me, I am going to take our master's advice and rest at my home on the Kulatz Bridge.
7359 : This chest is locked. It can be opened with %.
7360 : This chest is empty.
7361 : Your inventory is full. You cannot carry any more items.
7362 : You must be closer to the chest to open it.
7363 : % opens the chest and finds %.
7364 : The item in this chest cannot be handled by the other members of your party. % receives the %.

7366 : You obtain a key item, %, from the chest.
7367 : You unlock the chest!
7368 : % fails to open the chest.
7369 : The chest was trapped!
7370 : You cannot open the chest when you are in a weakened state.
7371 : The chest was a mimic!
7372 : You cannot open the chest while participating in the moogle event.
7373 : The chest was but an illusion...
7374 : The chest appears to be locked. If only you had %, perhaps you could open it...
7375 : There is a dried up fountain here.
7376 : There is a dried up fountain here. They say if you throw in %, you can talk with the dead.
7377 : You throw % into the fountain, but nothing happens. You pick up your %.
7378 : YOU HAVE DEFEATED THE MONSTER
7379 : Dark... So dark... I can't...move... Somebody...free me from this place... Free me from this darkness...
7380 : I still have something I need to tell her...
7381 : There is a pond here.
7382 : You throw in % and give a moment of silence for the spirits of the beasts.
7383 : Stop...
7384 : Your futile attempts at respect are nothing but self-gratifying actions. Do you think that throwing % in this pond will bring the beasts back? Do you think they will be appeased?
7385 : Have you ever stopped to think why it's always the people who survive and the beasts that die?
7386 : Only I can relieve them of their true pain--and that is through revenge. You understand my words, do you not?
7387 : My pet was taken from me and my body left unable to perform my act. I cannot forgive what has come upon me.
7388 : I ask you for your assistance. I will be waiting for your answer the next time we meet, but I already know you will help me.
7389 : YOU HAVE DEFEATED THE MONSTER
7390 : You are currently unable to do anything.
7391 : You are late. Is something wrong? You look as if you are confused by my being here.
7392 : If you must know, I could not allow my brother to be involved in this.
7393 : I am not inclined to inform Narcheral, but the white mages from the cathedral have been deployed into the surrounding area. Any further assembly of monsters has been prevented.
7394 : All that remains is to quell the rage of the marquis.
7395 : Jeronne, inform the adventurer what [he/she] needs to know. I am going to check on our backup.
7396 : He is such a kind man. I was ordered to keep my opinions to myself...but I know that this decision was made with Prince Trion in mind.
7397 : The Prince looks fine, but the truth is that his wounds are not healing well.
7398 : However, if Prince Trion learned of the situation that unfolded in Tavnazia, he would more than likely wish to lead the forces onto the battlefield himself.
7399 : The reason Prince Pieuje is keeping this operation a secret is solely for the well-being of Prince Trion.
7400 : I apologize. I have been rambling...  Let me inform you on our latest report. It seems as if the % possessed by dark stalkers is the signal for assembly.
7401 : Now, the barrier is prohibiting the assembly. Now is the perfect time to purify the marquis' soul. Use the % and find a place suitable for calling him forth.
7402 : The details of this operation are strictly to have adventurers proceed in advance. When the soul has been purified, take back the proof of your success to Narcheral and we will continue from there.
7403 : May the Goddess protect you in Her mercy...
7404 : Again, I apologize for the length of my speech, but there is one more thing. Narcheral is not rushing the situation. He and I were raised in different monasteries.
7405 : And those two monasteries have been destroyed by the Orcs. We both have the same wish in our hearts... But we do not want to lose anything more.
7406 : You find nothing.
7407 : You feel a conspicuously evil presence.
7408 : You are able to make out the blurred letters. The soul of Tavnazia will never perish.
7409 : It is finally...over... Ahh... I can... I can see... Tavnazia... The land of wind...and light... My... My home...!
7410 : I never expected to see you here again... You adventurers certainly get around.
7411 : ...And now what of zee Book of zee Gods? What has become of it since zee ancient restored its magic?
7412 : ...I see. Zee Star Sibyl has yet to forgive Ajido-Marujido...
7413 : If she is really zat furious... ...It's possible zee Star Sibyl intends to quash all traces of Ajido-Marujido's natural-born magical ability.
7414 : Zee Dark Dungeon has zat kind of power. In my student days, I saw with my own eyes one who had met with such a fate.
7415 : ..... And how is poor Apururu holding up? She mustaru be worrying herself sick.
7416 : And zat is zee course of action she has decided on? ...Such a brave girl.
7417 : Well, zen. You must take my % and return to Windurst. Please help our dear Apururu.
7418 : Take zee Book of zee Gods to Ajido-Marujido. He is not one to shrink back in zee face of zee truth.
7419 : Your Highness! The Orcs have formed a stronghold in the Qu'Bia Arena, and their leaders have gathered there!
7420 : Understood. You may step down. It looks as though this conflict is to be decided in the arena.
7421 : Noble knights of San d'Oria! If you fear for your lives, you are free to return to your families. However, unless the Orcs are defeated here today, you may not have a home to return to.
7422 : Those who wish to stay, entrust your lives to me, and I will not let you, your families, nor our fine kingdom down.
7423 : Let us take back what the beasts have wrongfully stolen from us! Let us bring victory to the San d'Orian people!
7424 : Here are your orders! Rahal, Curilla--have your knights surround the arena. Allow not a single Orc to escape.
7425 : Understood, Your Highness.
7426 : We will not let the Kingdom down.
7427 : What of your knights, Brother?
7428 : My company will enter the arena and attempt to locate the central command.
7429 : Prince Trion! That would be suicide! Assign the task to my knights!
7430 : Do not be ridiculous, Rahal. I have a duty to my kingdom and the countless lives that reside within it. And even if I am to fall in battle, Pieuje will be there to replace me.
7431 : Prince Trion...
7432 : Knights, take your positions! The time for judgment is upon us! And may victory taste as sweet as the Rolanberry 813 we shall drink when we return home!
7433 : Prince Trion.
7434 : Curilla?
7435 : There are still matters between us that are yet to be settled. I expect your prompt and safe return...
7436 : As I expect yours.
7437 : Sir!
7438 : My brother...
7439 : Be silent, Pieuje, for I know that which you wish to say. Support the frontline, and take care of San d'Oria when that time comes.
7440 : Do not be foolish. I have already seen the light--the light of victory which shines down upon you.
7441 : Your words have given me strength, Pieuje. I thank you.
7442 : It is the least I can do for my noble brother...
7443 : I will be here waiting for your return!
7444 : Take care, Pieuje!
7445 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7446 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7447 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7448 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7449 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7450 : Now, listen close...
7451 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7452 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7453 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7454 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7455 : .........listen......
7456 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7457 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7458 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. The Rank 5 Mission. The Heir to the Light. The Jester Who'd Be King. Pieuje's Decision. Peace for the Spirit. The First Meeting. Curses, Foiled A-Golem!?(pt.1). Curses, Foiled A-Golem!?(pt.2). Scattered Into Shadow. Those Who Lurk in Shadows. Of Knights and Orcs(pt.1). Of Knights and Orcs(pt.2).
7462 : It is some sort of device.

7464 : It feels a little damp...
7465 : It looks a little dusty...
7466 : You can feel a little air leaking from the cracks in the machine...

7496 : The emblem on your hand glows with even greater intensity!

7500 : Ah, %. We've no time to lose.
7501 : Mother is being held captive within the walls of the Qu'Bia Arena.
7502 : I tried to get in, only to find my entry thwarted by a curious magical barrier. This must be the power of the Seed Crystal.
7503 : We have only one choice. We must harness this power for ourselves, and use it to negate the shield that bars our way.
7504 : Remnants of the crystal's glow can be found scattered throughout these ruins. Their light has grown weak, and their power unstable...
7505 : But if you can retrieve them all before their power fades, they will fuse to form the %. This is the key that will open our path.
7506 : Do hurry, %. Mother is waiting for us, and time is of the essence...
7507 : The glow of the Mark of Seed flickers and dims ever so slightly...
7508 : The Mark of Seed grows fainter still. Before long, it will fade away entirely...
7509 : The Mark of Seed is about to dissipate entirely! Only a faint outline remains...

10827 : Ah, there you are! I have been waiting for you!
10828 : These are rather unusual ruins. According to legend, this place was inhabited by an ancient civilization.
10829 : If the Orcs are using this place, there should not be any kind of traps to worry about.
10830 : Therefore, we should split up and try to find the captured knights.
10831 : How do you respond? Sure thing. Sorry, count me out. What should we do?
10832 : It is the injured that worry me the most; monsters are attracted by the smell of blood.
10833 : Furthermore, the monsters here are mostly made up of the undead, making it even more dangerous. We have to hurry.
10834 : We have come all this way... You cannot give up on me now.
10835 : Time is of the essence here. Many lives are depending on us.
10836 : Beneath these ruins is an area made up of multiple smaller rooms.
10837 : We should probably try searching them first.
10838 : I will search the western side, so you take the east.
10839 : Mukdrom did not mention anything, but I imagine the room where the knights are being held is rigged to prevent their escape.
10840 : Also, it goes without saying, but stay alert at all times down here.
10841 : The door appears to be locked.
10842 : There is a doll preventing you from opening the door.
10843 : What will you do? Try to move it. Attack it. Examine it. Nothing.
10844 : It is too heavy to move.
10845 : It is too hard to break.
10846 : You examine the doll. It might move again if you can find a way to power it...
10847 : You! What are you doing here!?
10848 : You have my gratitude... I am amazed that you managed to find us here.
10849 : I have fought many Orcs in my day, but the unit led by Mukdrom is on a whole new level.
10850 : They must be the elite Orcish unit from up north that's looking for the egg.
10851 : Not long ago, one of my scouts spotted what appeared to be the egg on a cliff in the northern Beaucedine Glacier, but the Orcs beat us to it.
10852 : I'm worried what'll happen if they manage to break open the egg before we can stop them.
10853 : Mukdrom said something about obtaining untold power if he can break the egg open.
10854 : It appears that someone was talking to Mukdrom's subordinates...
10855 : At any rate, we have to stop them before that comes to pass.
10856 : Ungh...
10857 : Altennia, you mustn't exert yourself in such a condition.
10858 : Excenmille!
10859 : It will take some time before the rescue unit can arrive here from San d'Oria.
10860 : Also, I witnessed Mukdrom fail when he tried to split open the egg.
10861 : What!?
10862 : Altennia, I heard about what happened from the knights being held in the other room.
10863 : They told me how you risked your life in order to save as many people as possible.
10864 : I was only doing what you taught me.
10865 : When facing an opponent you have no chance of beating, proposing a one-on-one duel may lead to new possibilities.
10866 : That advice works especially well against Orcs.
10867 : Even still, I was unable to save everybody...
10868 : Perhaps, but your messenger was able to reach the capital.
10869 : That is what led % and me here. You can leave the rest to us.
10870 : Thank you. I am confident that you will be victorious.
10871 : %, once the rescue unit arrives, we must hurry back to Mukdrom and take him out.
10872 : I need you to go on ahead and scout the Orcs' movements before then.
10873 : Even though Mukdrom was unable to break open the World Eater Egg, we must put a stop to his plans!
10874 : Return to the point of interest in the northeastern section of Beaucedine Glacier.
10875 : Altennia and the others have already been rescued.
