6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

6914 : We haven't defeated many enemies yet. Only # so far.
6915 : We've only defeated # [enemy/enemies] so far. Nothing to write home about.

6925 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!
6926 : How many enemies have we defeated? Hmm, around #...
6927 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6928 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
6929 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
6930 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
6931 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
6932 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
6933 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
6934 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
6935 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
6936 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
6937 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
6938 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.
6939 : I'm just guessing here, but I'd say we've destroyed about # [enemy/enemies] today!
6940 : Enemies defeated? I wasn't really keeping track. Around #, I suppose...
6941 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6942 : How many enemies we've defeated? Isn't it something like #?
6943 : Let's see... So far we've wiped the floor with # enemies. Good job!
6944 : The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies]--a most impressive figure. Shall I prepare tea and biscuits?
6945 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
6946 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
6947 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
6948 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
6949 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.
6950 : We've already rid the land of # enemies today, but it doesn't seem to make even the slightest dint in their numbers.
6951 : How many enemies we've beaten? Why, that would be heaps and heaps!

7092 : Unless you're willin' to wipe that helpless look off your face and lend us a hand. That'd be a different story.
7093 : Assist with the fortifications? Show them how it's done! Refuse to help. Ask for an explanation.
7094 : Alright! That's the spirit! Let's get a move on, then.
7095 : Hmph, I figured as much by lookin' at you. Beat it, then. This is no place for tourists.
7096 : Like I said, in preparation for an enemy assault, we're workin' to fortify these defensive barriers. If you're willin', I'd like to place you in charge of managin' these here craftsmen as they go about it.
7097 : To be more precise, once you get to each craftsman's position, you have to tell 'em exactly what I'm about to tell you. Namely, what type of crystal they need to be usin'. That's all there is to it.
7098 : The young Elvaan wearin' the red hat is a blacksmith. Make sure he's using fire crystals.
7099 : The adorable little Tarutaru with the blonde braids is laying plaster. Gonna have to get her on some ice crystals.
7100 : The Hume lady is a stonemason, and a darn good one. She's gonna be needin' wind crystals.
7101 : That old coot of an Elvaan with the huge axe strapped across his back is a carpenter. Famous 'round these parts. Make sure you get him workin' with earth crystals.
7102 : May not look it, but the Mithra with the black kerchief wrapped 'round her noggin is an architect. She's gonna need her lightning crystals.
7103 : That sprat of a Tarutaru wearin' the blue getup's a handy lil' plumber. Surin' he'll be wantin' his water crystals, no doubt.
7104 : The good-looking fella in all white does scaffoldin'. Young Hume lad. See to it he's usin' light crystals.
7105 : The lady Elvaan's a painter. Handles a brush like nobody I never seen. Need dark crystals in that line of work. And that's it.
7106 : Ahhh, one more thing. If you're too late issuin' your orders, they're liable to up and leave their posts. So be right, and be quick.
7107 : Choose a crystal! Fire crystal. Ice crystal. Wind crystal. Earth crystal. Lightning crystal. Water crystal. Light crystal. Dark crystal. Plumb give up.
7108 : Hey now, you're runnin' this here operation! You can't just quit! There's no quitting in war!
7109 : Wow... You sure botched that job. All them wrong orders threw the craftsmen off kilter. They're demandin' a new foreman.
7110 : Well, the good news is you're gettin' your orders right. The bad news is that you're takin' your sweet time doing it. We'll never be ready for the Beastmen at this rate.
7111 : Come on, now! You even want to win this war!? The craftsmen are startin' to strike thanks to your incompetence!
7114 : NPC#
7115 : [///]
7116 : Ah, you must be %. We've been expecting you.
7117 : The delivery took you # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7118 : The delivery took you # [minute/minutes] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7119 : While you were dawdling your way here, a separate shipment of construction materials was delivered to us. We shan't be requiring anymore.
7120 : I commend you on your expeditiousness. Thanks to you, the construction work on our provision storehouse here can proceed as planned.
7121 : So you have something to aspire to, the quickest delivery thus far was made by %. That indefatigable soldier traversed the same course as you in just # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
7122 : You're the current quickest delivery record holder, with a lightning-fast time of # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time). But that's no excuse to slack off, you hear?

7126 : Perhaps you should first attend to more pressing matters...
7127 : Something tells you that you should wait a moment and try again.
7128 : I am far too busy to speak with you now. Perhaps I'll have a little time later.
7129 : Good show on your last operation. Now go make an official report to Sir Rasdinice.
7130 : Good work on that last operation. Now report back to First Centurion Hieronymus before he has your hide!
7131 : Nice job on your last operation. Now don't forget to report back to Emhi Tchaoryo!
7132 : It seems that you were not successful in your last operation. But do not let one small failure hang heavy on your soul. Report to Sir Rasdinice and put this all behind you.
7133 : Weren't so lucky during that last operation, were you? Well, don't worry about it too much. Report to First Centurion Hieronymus and get some rest, soldier.
7134 : Hmmm... Didn't do so well on that last operation, did you? I know it's hard, but it's better if you're up-front about these things. If you know what's good for you, you'll hurry down and report to Emhi Tchaoryo before the major finds out first.
7135 : Make haste, %. Sir Rasdinice awaits your report!
7136 : What are you waiting for, %? Report to First Centurion Hieronymus on the double!
7137 : Why are you wasting your time chatting with me? Shouldn't you be reporting to Emhi Tchaoryo?
7138 : Good work, soldier. [The Kingdom/The Republic/The Federation] thanks you for your cooperation.
7139 : I am charged with the provisioning of supplies for our troops out on the battlefield. I can issue you temporary items in exchange for Allied Notes.

7145 : You must attain a higher rank if you wish to be issued %.
7146 : Is there anything else you require?
7147 : Let the Blade of the Conqueror once again bring glory to the Kingdom!
7148 : Gwahahaha! Let me cool you off a little before I send you to hell!
7149 : Father! Lend me your strength!
7150 : For the king!
7151 : My spear is lightning...and your scream shall be the thunder which follows my mighty strike!
7152 : Ha hah! Your arrows cannot pierce the iron will of a true knight!
7153 : This arrow to your heart shall be Altana's final judgment.
7154 : Shogyo Mujo! Zesho Meppo! Shometsu Metsui! Jakumetsu Iraku!
7155 : There is no escape...save death!
7156 : Altana! Let your divine light guide us to victory!
7157 : You barbarians will regret the day you set foot on Bastokan soil!
7158 : Ryaaaaaaaaah!
7159 : Men! Do not fear the enemy! It is our blades they shall fear!
7160 : A swift end is the only mercy you will receive from me, fiends!
7161 : Watch carefully, because this is the last thing you'll ever see in this life!
7162 : I never liked fighting on land... Now, give me a well armed battleship on the open sea, and I'll have those turtlebacks running for their lives!
7163 : A soldier always comes prepared! Hehehehe!
7164 : To your seats, boys! The show is about to begin!
7165 : Ahahahaha! My hand slipped!
7166 : This is your last chance. Throw down your weapons and your life will be spared. If you refuse...
7167 : The gates to the underworld have opened! I'll see you on the other side...or not! Wahahahahah!
7168 : There is nothing more magnificent than the dance of flames on the battlefield!
7169 : <Phew!> I think I've had enough of this volume!
7170 : Guttler: Guttler thirsty! Guttler want blood! More blood!
7171 : Time to go to work!
7172 : Invincible! Indestructible! Indubitable! The age of the Cardians is upon us!
7173 : You, over there. No, wait! You're supposed to be on that side! Hold on, which one were you again? Arrrghhh!
7174 : <Snorrre>... Is that the best you can do?
7175 : Petty beastman hordes are nothing compared to giant wildebeests of homeland! I swat you all down like fruit flies!
7176 : <Yawn>... Um... Holy light...show the way...?
7177 : The protection of the throne comes before all else. Only by direct order of the royaulais will I wield my blade on the battlefield. Such is the duty of the Royal Guards.
7178 : Hah hah hah! The ringing of steel upon steel! The dripping stench of the battlefield! What could be better than war? The nobles can have their balls, I'll do my dance on the front lines!
7179 : How dare a baseborn peasant raise [his/her] voice to a noble knight!? Begone, before I strike you down myself!
7180 : The Kingdom's defeat at Jugner still stings. To avenge the souls of those lost on that fateful day, we must join hands and take up arms as one.
7181 : Not once in the four hundred years since the dawn of the Royal Knights has the Kingdom found itself in such peril. Let us take up our pikes and stand our ground to ensure another four centuries of prosperity!
7182 : It is often in times of strife that a man's true nature is revealed. Will you stand tall in the face of fear, or run and cower in the wake of your mother's dress?
7183 : While our holy doctrines specifically prohibit the taking of another life, you need not hesitate on the battlefield. The Church has branded the beastmen enemies of Altana. The purification must begin! It is the will of the Goddess!!!
7184 : After years of training in the Far East, I return only to find my nation burning at the hands of the infernal beastman hordes. The heathens shall pay dearly... My work has only just begun.
7185 : You have the look of a fine warrior. It is a pity you are not one of my Crimson Wolves.
7186 : The eyes of the Goddess are ever upon us. We must remain steadfast against the evils from without, as well as those from within.
7187 : The Republic was formed with the blood and sweat of the people. The flames of freedom must continue to light our furnaces of strength. The waters of civilization must continue to turn our wheels of ingenuity!
7188 : Turtle sleeps in a rocky den 'Cause he's not a citizen Strike him down with sword and stave Stick a blue flag in his grave
7189 : We may have the upper hand in technology and munitions, but the enemy's advantage lies in their sheer numbers. The Allied Campaign will not win in a day, soldier. Make every bullet count.
7190 : The Metalworks' strategies are too timid for my taste. The beastmen are nothing but dominoes, waiting to be toppled. A swift, aggressive assault is the only way to victory.
7191 : Move along, soldier. I have nothing to say to you.
7192 : Halt! If you're not one of the Fourth, then get your sorry tail over to the recruitment office on the double! And if you are one of us, then what the hell are you doing here talking to me!? Get back on the battlefield! About...FACE!
7193 : ...Heavy infantry, five columns of 200... Two 100-knight regiments... Enemy force casualties estimated at 5,000... Oh, I apologize, soldier. I've spent the past few nights preparing for a joint operation with San d'Oria's Royal Knights.
7194 : You look like you've seen better days, soldier. Let me guess, it's the war that's bringing you down. What you need is a little music in your life!
7195 : If it weren't for the Galkan heavy infantry, this nation wouldn't last a month against the turtlebacks. And what thanks do we get? A handful of stale army biscuits!
7196 : Have you ever stopped to ponder what that comet might truly portend? I'd like to believe it is a message of hope--that soon this age of darkness will come to a close...
7197 : Oh, whatever has become of my sweet Windurst? Rabble running through the streets, streets overrun with rabble! Why are you even speaking to me!? Does the title Master Caster no longer garner even an onz of respect!?
7198 : Ah, the Fates have brought you to Gariri the Magnificent! Why am I thus called, you ask? Why, because only I was magnificent enough to decryptify those mysteriously marvelous Near Eastern tomes and open a window to...the Other Side!
7199 : We all wear masks because deep down inside we are nothing but beasts. The question I ask you is, to which do you submit--the mask, or the beast?
7200 : (Guttler! I told you to keep qui--) Ahahahah... Don't mind me, I was just...uh...keeping myself company! (Shhh! If you open your mouth one more ti--) Ahahaha... Uh, were you still there?
7201 : If only the Parliament of Patriarchs would loosen the strings on their purses a little more, I would be outside right now roasting up a couple birdmen to snack on!
7202 : Have fun while you can, filthy mercenary, because before long you'll be back on the streets where you belong--replaced by a quiet, obedient army of Cardians!
7203 : Normally, it is my duty to protect the patriarchs of parliament, but with the fate of Windurst in doubt, I'm forced to lead my loyal pets to the front lines.
7204 : Do you like the headpiece? I made it from my firrrst victim. I wear it to let everrryone know what happens when they cross Mikhe Aryohcha!
7205 : Back in my home, Ulbuka, I hear rumors of great riches in eastern lands. But now I am here, and where are riches? I see nothing but Tarus! Ahahahaha!
7206 : <Yaaawn>... Mastering these Near Eastern magics can be quite taxing. If I had a choice, I'd rather be back in bed, relaxing...
7207 : I saved this one especially for you!
7208 : Hiiiiii-yah!
7209 : My dear pupil, Dalzakk. You still have much to learn...
7210 : Witness the true embodiment of my sorrow.
7211 : Heh heh heh!
7212 : <Giggle>...
7213 : Wheheheheh! You thirsty, Kopeh?
7214 : Come, Kilhwch! We must strike down the evil which stands before us!
7215 : My brothers and sisters! Raise your blades for justice!
7216 : Kilhwch! Silence those fiends!
7217 : To your feet, Kilhwch!
7218 : Lady Ulla. We must retreat.
7219 : How dare you!
7220 : The raven shalt spare nary a tear for thy demise.
7221 : Watch! And see how a real mercenary earrrns her wage!
7222 : Leave me be. The verge of battle is no time for words.
7223 : Fear not. My fists will guide us to victory.
7224 : My daughter awaits her father at home. I will permit no Beastman to delay my return.
7225 : Beyond this point lies the sealed royal tomb of King Ranperre. Tell me, %, do you believe the legends?
7226 : The Orc war machine draws near. We must brace ourselves for battle.
7227 : In former times, this island was inhabited by a ferocious tribe of vikings. It is said they braved vast expanses of open sea to arrive here. Romantic, don't you think?
7228 : Surely you have seen the tigers that roam these downs. They were brought from the northern continent by the Orcs themselves. They are highly prized for their luxurious pelts, though their bloodlust makes them formidable game.
7229 : The brotherhood of this place once welcomed me long ago. I pray that the years have been kind to them.
7230 : The Gold Musketeers of the Republican Army are marshalled by young woman. Such talk is sure to inspire my daughter.
7231 : Bastok was forced to abandon the Palborough Mines following a Beastman invasion. How an army such as the Republic's could permit such an affront baffles me to no end.
7232 : The village elder in La Vaule told me of the so-called wyrm deity of Grauberg. Of course, I am sure it is nothing more than folktales. Still, my curiosity is piqued...
7233 : Strange... I am certain the vegetation of this area is different from when I last visited. Surely I would not have allowed myself to forget such beautiful flowers.
7234 : Such devasation... Even the resilient Goobbue were not able to survive. I wonder if this place shall ever be restored to its former glory...
7235 : History tells us that it was in the year 381 that San d'Oria's iron-tempered  King Lanfeaur R d'Oraguille came these lands to strike a peace with the Quadav. Whatever happened to the bond that was formed...?
7236 : I have seen here two twins who between them share a power for magic the likes of which I have never seen. This is indeed a strange nation.
7237 : Unfortunate... I had always wished to gaze upon the fabled magic towers of West Sarutabaruta with my own eyes. Yet I fear I may be too late...
7238 : This fortress is lauded as the impregnable point of Windurst's defenses. Goddess forbid, should it happen to be taken, Windurst is unlikely to last more than a month's time.
7239 : These windblown sands reak havoc on my throat. I look forward to a cup of my daughter's fine Batallia tea.
7240 : Take heed, %. I have seen Beastman-dug battle trenches throughout these plains. Should you be found, your life is forfeit.
7241 : There is an ominous feeling in the air... This is no place to linger.
7242 : Never have I felt a cold as piercing as this. My teeth chatter and my toes grow numb. We would do well to find a place to warm ourselves.
7243 : I wonder if it was not somewhere near here where minister Francmage was dispatched on the Multinational Expedition some 10 years ago.
7244 : Never did I imagine the day would come that I would set foot in this accursed place. Has great is our foe's desperation? Do not lower your guard, %.
7245 : And so we breach the enemy's inner sanctum. Expect anything, %! And don't die on me!
7246 : As the Allied Forces have long maintained, this citadel would be ideally suited to the defense of Jeuno.
7247 : A well conceived strategy... A stronghold established under the cover of the nest of these vile crawlers. It is almost surely to be overlooked by the enemy.
7248 : Oh, mighty Altana, be the sword in my hand. With you, the swift cannot flee, nor the strong escape. Receive mine enemies, for the mercy of the Goddess embraces even the wicked.
7249 : Heh heh heh! Wonder what technique I should try out on these ol' beastmen chumps.
7250 : Haha... Who will be the next darling recipient of my spells?
7251 : Red blood, blue blood, any colorrr blood. If it bleeds, we can kill it!
7252 : What's taking so long? I'm getting all antsy-wantsy! My pets are I are all bad at staying still...
7253 : Do not fear. Righteousness will prevail. I shall show you victory!
7254 : Promise me one thing. Should anything happen to me... Look after my daughter.
7255 : I reckon I'll be earnin' my keep. Won't be doin' nothin' extra, though. Don't be expectin' me to risk my hide without my due an' proper, mm-hmmm.
7256 : Bravo really is a dear once you get to know him. It's just that in the heat of battle he... Well, you'll see.
7257 : My blade, Kyomon, anticipates much beastman blood. This battle may prove interesting, yet.
7258 : Look to me, mortals! And be haunted for the rest of your brief time in this world!
7259 : For a split second, you thought you saw Titania turn and shoot you a tiny smile.
7260 : The flower atop Babban Ny Mheillea's head appears to be in full bloom!
7261 : Ribbit! Ribbit!
7262 : You'd better watch your back!
7263 : Don't take this personally, but I've got children to feed.
7264 : Time to have some fun!
7265 : Reckon it's time tuh earn my keep, mm-hmm.
7266 : Come now, Bravo! It's high time we taught these beasts what a wyvern is truly capable of!
7267 : Hehe, so many willing to be sacrificed!
7268 : Hmph. Perhaps I should just burn the eyes of these infidels with my true form.
7269 : I fear not death, for the Goddess awaits us with open arms.
7270 : It is not yet your time.
7271 : Be strong, for the Goddess is with you, always.
7272 : Return to the dust whence you came! Randgrith!!!
7273 : Saints and heroes...glory and despair... Of these I shall sing unto my dying breath.
7274 : When work has ended stay not late. Return to where thy dearest awaits.
7275 : O gentle Goddess of the Dawn, thou brighten the black of night. Hear our song and heed our call, and bathe us in your delight.
7276 : Press forward valiant soldiers, glory draws nearer still. Thy deeds shall resound forever, by my stirring song fulfilled.
7277 : Loyal children of Altana, arise and be sustained. Be nourished in thine undying faith, and bask in victory's refrain.
7278 : Sing! Dance! Laugh, and cry! Let sweat rain down in floods! Ride upon this rhythmic beat, make seethe thy red life blood!
7279 : Dance thine elegant, airy steps that has won a thousand hearts. Enchant, enthrall, and captivate, treat none with disregard.
7280 : Honored am I to have this chance to share the same stage with you.

7500 : What would you like to know? Nothing. I'm sorry. About performance assessment. About Allied Tags. About temporary items. About Unions.
7501 : I am sorry, but at this time, I cannot be of any assistance in that area.
7502 : Understood. I shall now judge your performance and award the proper remuneration.
7503 : Ah, I'm sorry to inform you that your performance has not earned you any compensation.
7504 : Understood. I shall prepare a new set of tags for you now.
7505 : You've already undergone an evaluation for this battle, or had you forgotten? As much as I'd like to, I'm forbidden from providing you with a new set of Allied Taegs until the next battle begins.
7506 : Anyone wearing Allied Tags while participating in a campaign battle will be judged on their overall performance.
7507 : Soldiers will be evaluated not only on their fighting skills, but also on how much they contribute to the efforts of their allies through means such as healing and enhancing.
7508 : However, beware that if you leave the area before being assessed, you will be deemed a deserter and will forfeit all rewards earned that day.
7509 : Also, while there are no immediate penalties for being knocked out, falling in battle will significantly lower the score given to you.

7511 : Allied Tags are a special type of identification given to all participants of Allied Campaign battles.

7513 : However, some of the drawbacks include the inability to improve skills and earn experience points for individual kills, as well as the right to loot fallen enemies.
7514 : Temporary items can be purchased in exchange for Allied Notes.
7515 : There are several different varieties of items, but they all have one thing in common--they can only be used on the battlefield they were issued.
7516 : It is highly recommended that you first survey a battle's conditions and then select the supplies that you believe will benefit you most.
7517 : Please remember that all temporary items you carry on your person will be confiscated in the event that you leave the area.
7518 : You can only purchase temporary items if your nation of allegiance is commanding the campaign.
7519 : That is all.
7520 : I will require a teleportation fee of # Allied Note[/s]. I see you currently possess #.

7544 : Your reputation within the Allied Campaign has risen by #!
7545 : I am sorry, %, but your campaign medal has expired. I cannot issue tags to anyone not authorized by the Allied Forces. Return to your nation's capital and speak with a Campaign Evaluation Official.
7546 : Oh ho! Keen to join a Union, are we? Very well. Listen up and I shall tell you all you need to know.
7547 : In order to better coordinate Allied efforts against the beastman menace, we have instituted a system of ad hoc tactical regiments called Unions. With five units to a battlefield, union registration is open to any proven soldier in possession of Allied Tags.
7548 : In return for their aid in advancing the war effort, union registrants will be eligible to earn a share of the spoils of war.
7549 : Needless to say, the choicest rewards will be reserved for those unions which make the greatest contributions in combat. Prove your mettle on the field of battle, and you will earn glory for your union, as well as a sizable bounty of your own.
7550 : Be forewarned that your commitment to your union comes first and foremost. In the aftermath of battle, you will not be permitted to reap rewards from your individual exploits until your union has distributed its plunder.
7551 : Caution! If a union member joins or leaves an existing party, that party's treasure pool will be distributed automatically and immediately.
7552 : Register for a union? Yes. No.
7553 : [Transfer/Resign] from your current union? Yes. No.

7726 : Any of our fine birds here will bear you directly to the frontlines of battle. We charge a service fee of # Allied Notes, which goes towards seeing that the chocobos are well taken care of. My records indicate that you currently have # Allied Notes.
7727 : Hmmm... It looks like you don't have enough Allied Notes. Sorry, but these birds aren't going to feed and groom themselves.
7728 : I'm sorry, but we don't put our chocobos in the hands of people with %. We wouldn't want our feathered friends dying from fright now, would we?

7734 : Hm? You have no idea who I am?
7735 : Not ev'ryone appreciates the arts, I s'pose. I'll be quittin' the dancin' game soon, anyway. I'm meant to be at practice as we speak.
7736 : All my days have been filled with dance... I'm findin' it hard t'remember why I even started.
7737 : Dancin' never used t'be such a chore. And it made me mother and father so proud...
7738 : But now...
7739 : ...?
7740 : What a lovely, liltin' melody... I've never heard the pipes played so well.
7741 : I...I feel so light all o' a sudden...
7742 : I feel like I could float right off the ground.
7743 : I never knew I could enjoy dancin' just for the sake o' dancin'. No cheerin' audience. No dotin' parents...
7744 : Ye're fortunate, ye know. I usually perform before lords an' ladies.
7745 : Now where did that pipe player go? Sure'n that was a sweet song...
7746 : Milady!
7747 : Fairaure!
7748 : Thank Altana I've found you safe and sound. If anything should happen to you, my honor would be irrevocably stained...
7749 : Fairaure, how did you manage t'lag so far behind with those long Elvaan legs?
7750 : My apologies, milady! It shan't happen again!
7751 : Although, I s'pose I should be thankin' you.
7752 : Thanking me, milady?
7753 : I was on the verge of givin' up everythin'. The only reason I said I wanted t'see the stones in the lake was t'escape from dance practice.
7754 : If you hadn't agreed to sneak me out, I might o' thrown away me dancin' forever...
7755 : Fairaure, I've decided t'give dancin' another chance.
7756 : M-milady! I shall do everything in my power to see your dreams come to fruition!
7757 : Let us return to the estate!
7758 : You see a message engraved on the stone:
7759 : As we pierced the gloom of Jugner Forest, my dear steed (and renowned gourmand) Morten pecked at the ground, unearthing a fine mushroom.
7760 : Quieting the uneasy Morten, I examined the mushroom, and found that it was none other than a King Truffle, a prized ingredient I had thought to be only a legend.
7761 : Relying on Morten's keen sense of smell, we searched the area, and found bushels of other mushrooms. A fine mushroom soup will grace our table tonight.
7762 : To all travelers who wander in this forest--should you find your supplies dwindling and your hunger growing, search for nature's bounty and be saved!
7763 : Just take care your chocobo does not eat them first!   --Gwynham Ironheart, 755 Crystal Era.

7767 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7768 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7769 : Now, listen close...
7770 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.

7784 : You insert the % into the half-moon hole.
7785 : Many lives were lost when the Orcs invaded the quiet village of La Vaule. The tears of motherless children still dampen the forest bed.
7786 : Is this war nothing but the simple culmination of hate between the children of the dawn and those of the twilight? Or does a darker secret yet lurk in the shadows?
7787 : I can sense something on that island. Something important...
7788 : If the light of Altana so guides me, then perhaps I may take up my ensorcelled blade in the service of your nation.
7789 : The creature whinnies contentedly.
7790 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7791 : Now is not the time for that!

7829 : Gahaha...
7830 : I have found you, Excenmille M Aurchiat!
7831 : Speak not my family name, cur! And I am not yet...
7832 : Do not be rash, Excenmille. Leave this to %.
7833 : Hm? Another face I recognize...
7834 : You are the kind stranger that helped me escape from my cage in San d'Oria.
7835 : !?
7836 : You helped an Orc escape...?
7837 : My apologies, but after leaving my confinement, I recalled a rather important fact.
7838 : I was not, in actual fact, one of the barbaric Elvaan.
7839 : I have always been the glib-tongued Orc you see before you!
7840 : Koddek drukkreshblek!
7841 : Ah, my friend here is hungry for blood. Perhaps you should dine on this unappetizing fool, before we begin on the main course of tender rabbit!
7842 : Keeeg!!
7843 : Dradzad... The only blood spilled here was yours.
7844 : They do say the weak bark more than they bite...
7845 : ...!
7846 : Excenmille!
7847 : One day, I will come for you...
7848 : I will have my revenge!
7849 : Children! Are you unharmed!?
7850 : Altennia...
7851 : There may be more Orcs lurking in the underbrush. I leave the children in your care, Squire.
7852 : What is it, Excenmille?
7853 : ...
7854 : Excenmille!
7855 : I should have known something foolish was afoot! I fair killed my chocobo in my rush across La Theine!
7856 : Hmph. What do you expect us to do when our elders sit around arguing politics while Orcs run rampant!?
7857 : Excenmille... If only you knew how much your father, the count...
7858 : ...
7859 : <Sigh>... If only you would have a care for your own safety!
7860 : But I am glad to find you whole and not hanging over some Orc's cooking fire.
7861 : My thanks, %.
7862 : Who knows what grisly scene may have greeted me if you had not chased after these reckless fools...
7863 : %!
7864 : I'll have you know I would have defeated both those fiends without your intervention!
7865 : And besides, what sort of buffoon is taken in by an Orc's promises, however glib!?
7866 : You are easily fooled.
7867 : But you follow a code of honor, nonetheless.
7868 : Hmm...
7869 : You have yet to gain my full trust, but you are permitted to attend the next War Council!
7870 : In fact, that's an order from your captain!
7871 : Hehe. You should feel honored, %. It is rare an elder enjoys such praise from young Excenmille.
7872 : Perhaps it is time you knew more of the child's background.
7873 : Excenmille is bereft of a mother.
7874 : I know not the finer details, but she was slain by an Orc that had infiltrated the capital.
7875 : It was at a time when his father was absent on military duty...
7876 : As you can imagine, Excenmille has had little respect for the competence of his elders since then.
7877 : Ah, yes. I also mean to investigate the Temple Knight you mentioned.
7878 : From what I have learned so far, this Darvylle's history has a blemish or two...
7879 : But aside from all that, how did those boys learn of the Orcish Host's movements?
7880 : Here, please accept this in payment for your vigilance.
7881 : I will escort the children back to San d'Oria.
7882 : Assuming I am able to catch them!
7883 : <Sigh>... Have they learned nothing from this ordeal!?
7884 : Thank you again, %. Be on your guard in this forest.
7885 : Young Griffons! Your next operation will be to Clean and Sweep the Royal Knights' barracks!
7886 : Vokbrokgreg!
7887 : Commencing intel extraction.
7888 : Gathering intel
7889 : Gathering intel
7890 : Investigation complete!
7891 : You are too far away from the target.
7892 : You have already gathered intel at this location.
7893 : The stronghold has sustained considerable damage.
7894 : Your work at this location is complete.
7895 : Something tells you you should wait a little longer before inspecting this location.
7896 : You are unable to gather intel while under the effect of Sneak.
7897 : You have acquired intel on the enemy's supplies.
7898 : You have acquired intel on the enemy's defense structures.
7899 : You have acquired intel on the enemy's weapon stores.
7900 : Surveillance of this location is complete.
7901 : The gathered information is insufficient. More surveillance is required.
7902 : Adequate intel has been acquired.
7903 : Sufficient surveillance has already been carried out.
7904 : The Frost Bomb uses Hypothermal Combustion. The Fortification takes # [point/points] of damage.
7905 : The bombardment failed to inflict damage on the target.
7906 : You have acquired sufficient intel on the peculiar device.
7907 : These are the supplies you are to deliver to the stronghold in this area.
7908 : The supply unit carrying rations and munitions to our stronghold in this area was attacked en route, and forced to abandon the cargo. You are to locate the supplies and deliver them to their final destination.
7909 : Some of the items are raw and will spoil if not delivered immediately. You must hurry.
7910 : Some of the items are very delicate and will be destroyed if you are not careful. Avoid all confrontation with the enemy.
7911 : Now move out.
7912 : What are you waiting for, %!? Move out!
7913 : This is an Allied Checkpoint Garrison.
7914 : You have located the missing supplies!
7915 : Good work, %. You have done a great service for your nation.
7916 : What is this!? These supplies are in terrible condition! I'll have to request headquarters for another shipment...
7917 : Alright, %. The reinforcements are ready to be escorted to the stronghold in this area.
7918 : Welcome, %. The troops you are to guide to the stronghold haven't arrived yet. Please wait a little longer.
7919 : Come on! Come on! How long is this going to take!?
7920 : You're all slower than turtles in the mud! I've had enough!
7921 : Are we there yet!? Where in Altana's name is the stronghold!?
7922 : Are you ordering me to return to ranks? Eh, I guess I have no choice...
7923 : It's about time!
7924 : Don't you think some of us should have stayed at the checkpoint? What if the beastmen attack?
7925 : I'm worried about the soldiers back at the garrison. I have to see if they are all right!
7926 : Erm... But what about the soldiers at the stronghold? Maybe they're being attacked, too? Oh, what should I do?
7927 : Understood, [sir/ma'am]. I guess the garrison will be alright...
7928 : We're finally here... I sure hope nothing happened at the checkpoint...
7929 : Where's the enemy? I'll take out a whole battalion with one hand tied behind my back!
7930 : Huh!? Was that an enemy scout!?
7931 : Uh... Does anyone have a map?
7932 : Oh, the stronghold's this way? Thanks!
7933 : So this is my new station. Doesn't look too bad.
7934 : Welcome, %.
7935 : You have # more [minute/minutes] (Earth time) to complete this mission.
7936 : The reinforcements have lost their way...
7937 : About time you showed up, soldier. This here's the shipment of materials you'll be transporting.
7938 : I suspect you've already been briefed, but this is some volatile, dangerous stuff. But you signed up for this mission, so we're counting on you to deliver it to the stronghold before its power dissipates.
7939 : You'd best deliver that to the stronghold while it still packs some oomph.
7940 : What's this? Whatever power was in this is long gone. No, this won't do at all.
7941 : Ahhh, so you're military tactician who who drew up the plans for this latest supply mission. Why don't we ask one of the men how its going, shall we?
7942 : You are the tactician responsible for our latest operation? Then I shall report in on the status of our mission up until now.
7943 : As per orders, the supply caravan completed preparation of our cargo last night, and set out on the designated route at daybreak.
7944 : Unfortunately, we encountered an accident and lost a portion of our cargo.
7945 : Most regrettably, we encountered an accident and lost out entire load of cargo.
7946 : We encountered considerable beastman opposition. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
7947 : We encountered a superior beastman assault force. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
7948 : We encountered a beastman supply convoy, who was also made immediately aware of our presence. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
7949 : We encountered a substantial force under the direct command of a beastman general. In accordance with mission operatives, we [engaged the enemy in open battle/attempted to evade the enemy at all cost].
7950 : By the good graces of the Goddess, our convoy was able to emerge victorious over our adversaries.
7951 : By the good graces of the Goddess, our convoy was able to obliterate the beastman supply contingent. In addition, we seized a significant portion of the enemy's supplies.
7952 : However, despite our best efforts, our convoy was utterly defeated. All of our cargo was lost to the enemy horde.
7953 : By the good graces of the Goddess, we narrowly succeeded in throwing the beastmen ranks into chaos and disarray.
7954 : By the good graces of the Goddess, we somehow staved off the beastman attack and shook free. However, we were forced to abandon a portion of our cargo in the process.
7955 : However, we were unable to repel the beastman's relentless pursuit, and in the end our convoy was scattered. All of our cargo was lost to the enemy horde.
7956 : I am pleased to report that our unit was able to reach this stronghold safely with all of the intended cargo. The success of our mission was due in no small part to your brilliant planning.
7957 : Our unit was able to reach this stronghold safely with the cargo. Your planning may well have been the decisive factor in the success of our mission.
7958 : Our unit was able to reach this stronghold, though we did so bearing a great deal less than the intended cargo.
7959 : Supplies abandoned by the Beastmen can be seen be strewn about. However, there is nothing that could be put to any use.
7960 : Oh...? I dare say, have we met before? How may I be of service?
7961 : What am I doing? I am in search of the bard who was playing a pipe somewhere in this forest the other day.
7962 : You see, milady was captivated by the tune, and strongly wishes to meet with the bard in person.
7963 : Just a moment ago I heard music being played on a pipe, and made haste towards it. But alas, the sound suddenly broke off...
7964 : I continued further on to the lake, only to discover a broken pipe. There were signs that suggested a struggle may have taken place.
7965 : I fear for the safety of the pipe's owner...
7966 : I will continue my search for the bard.
7967 : It would break my heart if I had to bring such tragic news back to milady...
7968 : What? You're looking for someone who was attacked by a monster and dropped a pipe?
7969 : In that case, you need not look any further, for I am he. I love the beauty and solitude of this place, and often come here to play my pipe. Unfortunately, it seems a smilodon shares my sentiments.
7970 : I somehow managed to escape from its razor-sharp claws, but as luck would have it, I dropped my treasured pipe as I fled. I've been scouring the forest for it since. If I recall correctly...
7971 : Found it! Altana be praised!
7972 : But it's broken... If I had %, it might be possible to make repairs...
7973 : Well, well, we meet again.
7974 : Hey...isn't that %?
7975 : You brought it for me? Now I can fix my beloved pipe! You have my eternal gratitude.
7976 : There! Good as new!
7977 : So you're a dancer. That was some of the finest footwork I've seen in years.
7978 : That reminds me of when I trekked out here last. I was playing my favorite tune, when I caught glimpse of a little girl, a dancer. She must have heard my melody, because she started to dance. She was so pure, so full of joy and radiance, I was sincerely touched.
7979 : At that moment I felt as though the Goddess herself was smiling upon my decision to become a bard.
7980 : When the war is over, I plan to start a traveling circus troupe that will bring smiles and laughter wherever it goes.
7981 : I found this pebble here at the lake. As I gazed into its light, I realized that is what I wanted to do.
7982 : Hmmm? That's odd... It was glowing brightly until a while ago.
7983 : So the rumors were true.
7984 : Oh, you haven't heard?
7985 : You see, these peculiar, glowing pebbles come in pairs. It is said that if one were to be separated from the other, both would cease to glow.
7986 : Oh dear, it's getting rather late. I'd best be going. Till we meet again...
7987 : Looks like we've got the ingredients we came for, %. Now, all we need to do is spice them up a bit...and we'll have a dish that'll be the hit of the party!
7988 : I've heard of these stones being used in the making of particularly potent enchanted arrowheads. Let me take care of them. I've got a friend in the Windurst Boneworkers' Guild who owes me a favorrr or two.
7989 : As for the cinders... If my memorrry serves, these are used in the casting of what we call %.
7990 : I'll leave them to you. We'll give those beastmen a welcome they won't soon forget.
7991 : Now, the only place I rrrecall that could handle an order for % is the Gunpowder Room in Bastok.
7992 : But they've sealed their gates tight to outsiders ever since the war began...
7993 : If we were to go there now, we'd be turrrned away without a second thought.
7994 : But you already know what I'm thinking...don't you, %?
7995 : It's time for you to help us, in the way that only you can...
7996 : We'll be waiting for you at Fort Karugo-Narugo. And do hurry...our guests are unlikely to have qualms about arriving early.
7997 : May the Goddess protect you!
7998 : You must hurry and procure the %. If we fail to hold the enemy off at Fort Karugo-Narugo, our cause is as good as lost!
7999 : Silence those blundering footsteps, [man/woman]! You'll cost me my prize catch.
8000 : Silence, I said-- What's that? My son is looking for me at San d'Oria Eastgate?
8001 : ...And bawling his eyes out, I imagine. Thank you for your troubles. Tell him to remain where he is, and that I shall return after I have seen to my errands.
8002 : Ah, it's you again. Pray accept my apologies for my son's shameful behavior the other day.
8003 : I trust your new % is serving you well?
8004 : What is the meaning of this? You would disgrace a proud Elvaan by returning that which was gifted to you in good faith? I'll have no part of it!
8005 : At any rate, my piscine quarry here demands my full attention. If you would be so kind...
8006 : It would seem subtlety is not your strong suit. Or was there still something you would have of me?
8007 : Something you need? Ask for fishing advice. Ask about Exoroche.
8008 : Here's some advice: a [gentleman/gentlewoman] doesn't disturb [another/a] gentleman when he's busy fishing.
8009 : And here. Take my gift back, and I shall overlook your lack of decorum.
8010 : Ah. My boy has caused you grievance again, has he?
8011 : Has Exoroche been a nuisance? Yes...the lousy punk. Not in the slightest!
8012 : You have my apologies. I shall be sure to give him a proper scolding upon my return.
8013 : You are returning the blade on my son's behalf, you say!?
8014 : Whatever is the meaning of this?
8015 : Why do you return the blade? The boy's spirit is true. I've got a better one. My Gobbiebag was full.
8016 : Is that so? Nevertheless, it can be sold for good coin, can it not? Consider it recompense for my son's misdeeds.
8017 : ...And you have neither the sense nor wherewithal to organize your own belongings? I shudder to think of how your parents raised such a dunce!
8018 : Hah! Now that's a fine jest. That boy is too busy wetting his sleeves to show any higher aspirations. Or would you say otherwise?
8019 : What does Exoroche aspire to do? Earn the blade back from his father. Sell it and frivol away the money. Win fame and adulation in battle. Protect his family and kingdom.
8020 : The boy is true to his word, I will give him that. Still, he will have to show more than that to be worthy of a knight's weapon.
8021 : Now, as I believe I said a moment ago, I am a busy man. Pray leave me be.
8022 : He seeks to do what!? I knew the boy was a milksop, but to think he has been poisoned by thirst for coin as well! Why, I'll make him rue the day he ever voiced such petty desires!
8023 : He dreams of what!? So the boy thinks being a knight is all about personal glory, does he? He'll be getting a proper lesson in San d'Orian honor upon my return, this I tell you!
8024 : My son said that? And here I thought he saw that % as little more than a toy.
8025 : Perhaps he is more of a man than I had measured him for.
8026 : Very well. I shall return his beloved blade. As a present from you, we shall say.
8027 : Forgive me, but there are still fish to be caught before my return. Tell my son that I will be along in due time.
8028 : My thanks again for what you did for my son. I shall endeavor to see him raised to be as strong and honorable as yourself.
8029 : The % was returned to you.
8030 : A squad of Orcs?
8031 : %, look yonder!
8032 : Hogdazdek!
8033 : Darvylle, I would advise against keeping Buchzvotch waiting.  He is far from patient, even by Orc standards, so let's finish this and be on our way.
8034 : So you finally show your true colors, Temple Knight Darvylle.
8035 : I had my suspicions from the very beginning.
8036 : I commend you on your fine detective work. But, I am saddened to say that it was all for naught.
8037 : Betraying your king, and selling out your own comrades to the enemy... No words could describe my contempt for you.
8038 : Now, answer me! What evil objective lies behind these unforgiveable acts of treason!?
8039 : Your words wound me, Altennia. Why, I simply wish to restore my most precious San d'Oria to her former glory.
8040 : ...? What do you mean?
8041 : The tyrant king, Destin R d'Oraguille... He will meet his end at the hands of my sympathizers.
8042 : I can see it even now... It will be exactly like ten years past, when King Grantieul was regrettably slain by Orcs.
8043 : Wh-what?
8044 : Grrraaaaaagh!
8045 : D-Darvylle! Buchzvotch's patience is about to run dry!
8046 : It is I who has to bear the brunt of his fury. You would do me a great favor by delaying no further!
8047 : Blast!  How are we to help her with all those Orcs swarming about?
8048 : And...to where did Excenmille disappear?
8049 : <Sigh> Apart from Zogbog here, these Orcs understand not the joys of refined conversation. I am afraid the pleasantries end here.
8050 : W-we must act now, or else!
8051 : Uwaaaaaaaaah!
8052 : Excenmille? How did you know...!?
8053 : Y-you again!?
8054 : E-Excenmille!?
8055 : %! Now is our chance!
8056 : I am flattered you came all the way here to see me...
8057 : What have I done to deserve such a delicious treat?  You have made my day, little rabbit!
8058 : I would sooner turn blind than endure a daily dose of your face, Zogbog! Today we settle the score!
8059 : Rahal...and % as well!?
8060 : Well, well... With all the guests of honor present, the party can finally begin!
8061 : Gahahahaha! I look forward to roasting you on my cookfire, little rabbit!
8062 : Krogkrakblek!
8063 : B-Buchzvotch!
8064 : Dnukvekzukgreg!
8065 : ...... Vokbrokgreg!!!
8066 : I regret to inform you Buchzvotch is not in the best of moods at the moment. It would seem that you are all...too alive for him.
8067 : Th-that Orc is enormous!
8068 : ......
8069 : %! You have my leave to tend to the big one.
8070 : Lieutenant Rahal and I will see to the rest.
8071 : And one more thing, %. If I deem your performance unsatisfactory, you will be put on cleaning detail. Understood?
8072 : Rahal! Chaaaaaarge!
8073 : Good luck, %!
8074 : Grrraaaaaagh!!!
8075 : Gwaaaaaaah!
8076 : C-curses!!!
8077 : Veggrok! It would appear I sorely underestimated you, little rabbits...
8078 : This is not over! I shall return...with reinforcements!
8079 : Fleeing like a coward again, Zogbog!?
8080 : Flee, you say!? Spare me your mockery! This is merely a tactical withdrawal!
8081 : But mark my words... I shall be back for your head!
8082 : No one will rob me of revenge for my fallen clan!
8083 : Glekvuk! Retrea--I mean, move out!
8084 : That Zogbog...  When we last fought, he spoke of the same revenge. To what could he possibly be referring?
8085 : I cannot say...
8086 : By the way, %...
8087 : You shall commence cleaning detail after returning to headquarters. I trust you understand the reason?
8088 : Your negligence had the Young Griffons half a heartbeat away from having mincemeat for a captain!
8089 : Excenmille.
8090 : Wh-what is it now, Altennia?
8091 : I rushed here without a thought for my own safety, so the least you could do is--
8092 : Thank you...
8093 : !?
8094 : A-Altennia...
8095 : Sh-she is clearly suffering from trauma. We must--
8096 : Excenmille! Here I am trying to show my gratitude in earnest, and you...
8097 : <Sigh>
8098 : And thank you two as well, Rahal and %...
8099 : To all of you, I owe my life.
8100 : Wh-what?
8101 : Doggvdegg! The Orc general who laid siege to San d'Oria!
8102 : What shall we do, Excenmille!?
8103 : Excenmille?
8104 : %, we must evacuate immediately.
8105 : Th-that is...Bakgodek, of the Steelhide Horde!
8106 : Whence did their forces come to be so near!?
8107 : ......
8108 : Theirs must have been the unit stationed at La Vaule. But, they were reportedly marching for Jeuno...
8109 : Both generals Doggvdegg and Bakgodek--the two rocks upon which the Orcish forces are built, here? This does not bode well...
8110 : (Ah...!)
8111 : Excenmille, we stand not a chance against such numbers! It would be folly to even consider pursuit.
8112 : Excenmille?
8113 : Here they are! Has harm come to any of you!?
8114 : Altennia! You are safe!
8115 : Father!
8116 : Why, Excenmille. And be this not Rahal, Lord Lebrart's very own flesh and blood?
8117 : Is this carnage I see before me all your doing?
8118 : Sir! We have located Temple Knight Darvylle in the creek bed!
8119 : Darvylle, too? Apprehend the traitor, posthaste!
8120 : We'd best not linger longer than necessary. If the Orcish host were to find us, they would not receive us kindly.
8121 : You must be %. Altennia has informed me of your bravery. You have my gratitude.
8122 : I thank you also for the care of my son, Excenmille.  I hope we meet again upon return to San d'Oria.

8134 : We give chase! Allow not a single one of the pigmen to escape, lest they lick their wounds and return to bare their fangs at San d'Oria!
8135 : Accursed Orcs... That they would be so bold as to strike at a full-strength Iron Rams...
8136 : Please hold still, or the bandaging won't be secure.
8137 : Urgh... You have my thanks, lad.
8138 : Captain, we know not when the enemy may attempt another foray. Best we use this respite to down what food we can.
8139 : Machegue, furnish me with some hard bread from the rations sack, will you?
8140 : Um...Cyranuce. It appears the sack and I were separated in the course of the skirmish.
8141 : What!? B-but...my poor stomach...
8142 : Ah!
8143 : Captain Rahal! % approaches!
8144 : %. Your presence fortifies our spirit.
8145 : % sets down the %.
8146 : <Sniff, sniff> This enticing aroma... Could it truly be biscuits a la Rholont!? Thank you, %! All of us were on the verge of starvation!
8147 : Ah, the rich yet uncloying sweetness of Ronfaure maple syrup dances on my tongue! It reminds me so of Mother's home-baked pies!
8148 : Oh, torture me not with the mention of Mother's mouthwatering pies! But I say, the water is especially refreshing after having experienced the sludgy variety the forest has to offer.
8149 : All right, Griffins. We leave to rejoin the main force once those who took wounds have partaken of their rations.
8150 : Hmm... The sounding of the war drums has ceased. It would appear the enemy has finally withdrawn.
8151 : And not a moment too soon! We owe it all to Rholont and % for having managed to survive this far without having to skip a meal.
8152 : Hear, hear! The biscuits certainly put a spring in your step, Cyranuce, if only for the purpose of fleeing from danger.
8153 : A-and what do you imply by that!?
8154 : Lads. Glad am I to see you unscathed, but forget not for a second that you stand on a battlefield. The briefest lapses in concentration have allowed stray arrows to claim the lives of many a great hero.
8155 : Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!
8156 : Hm?
8157 : C-Captain Rahal, look yonder!
8158 : Zogbog... There's no mistaking him.
8159 : Not again!? But...what are we to do?
8160 : All of us know full well the answer to that question: we go exact revenge!
8161 : Do you not agree, Captain?
8162 : Wholeheartedly. But for now, we do no more than shadow Zogbog's movements. If he has devised any more fiendish plots, it would serve the Kingdom best that we learn of them.
8163 : Um...doesn't protocol require that we first seek the leave of the commanding off--?
8164 : H-hey! Captain! Cyranuce! Waaait!
8165 : C-Captain. The entire area is swarming with Orcs. Perhaps we should double back and--
8166 : Hush! I can't make out a single word of their conversation...
8167 : Well, they speak in the Orcish tongue, so that's only to be expected. Psst, Machegue.
8168 : You learned rudimentary Orcish from Sir Vailanice, did you not? What are they saying?
8169 : Huh? You were there for the lessons, too, weren't you? Use your own ears!
8170 : Y-you misunderstand. I could comprehend their gibberish with ease if I so chose, but doing so would uh...distract me from performing my duty as lookout.
8171 : (You. When is the general due to arrive?)
8172 : (Recent defeats very displease General Doggvdegg. He comes after he punish incompetent officers with death.)
8173 : (Hmph! A fine time in the war this is to be putting our own to the sword!)
8174 : (Tsk-tsk. You speak ill of general. The general hear of this.)
8175 : (Bah! Do as you please, despicable lickspittle!)
8176 : (Hm?)
8177 : (This warmachine I see before me--its maintenance is your doing? I am not easily impressed, but this is excellent work.)
8178 : (Master Zogbog speak very kind. My mind slow, but me fix good. Master Zogbog ask, me fix.)
8179 : (You are to be commended, soldier. Take this, and know that Zogbog rewards those who serve him well.)
8180 : (Huh? This strange stone Master Zogbog give. It not made by Orc.)
8181 : (Hahaha, good eyes to go with your deft hands, I see. But that is not all. This blueprint, I bestow upon you also.)
8182 : ...
8183 : (M-Master Zogbog! Th-this is--!)
8184 : (Hush now. Someone approaches. Tell not a soul of what transpired here. As for the blueprint...I look forward to seeing it become reality.)
8185 : (O Mighty Doggvdegg, long have I awaited your return. Your loyal servant, Zogbog, brings you tidings of consequence.)
8186 : (Tiding of consequence? You bring same tired subject!)
8187 : (Ah, my lord is most perceptive.)
8188 : (Soon, my lord... Soon, an explosion of colossal scale will occur at the Tavnazian Peninsula and forever sunder the Marquisate from the mainland.)
8189 : (It is imperative that our main force stationed there is recalled before it can be swallowed up by the land.)
8190 : (You listen, Zogbog.)
8191 : (My lord.)
8192 : (Your strange foresight serve Empire well.)
8193 : (Thank you, my lord.)
8194 : (But lately, you contribute only empty promise. No result. You flee from Garlaige with tail between leg. Today, you fail again. Many good soldier fall. What I say to Emperor?)
8195 : (H-had we not encountered unexpected complications--)
8196 : (Foolish Orc! All soldier know battlefield full of unexpect factor!)
8197 : (Our force soon conquer Tavnazia. But you say recall them and give absurd reason. You want my army become laughingstock?)
8198 : (B-but my lord, I speak the truth--)
8199 : (You speak nonsense! To Tavnazia with you!)
8200 : (Tav...Tavnazia!?)
8201 : (Nooo! General Doggvdegg, I implore you! A-another chance...please grant me but one more chance at redemption!)
8202 : (Sniveling dog! You disgust me!)
8203 : (You go to Tavnazia! Or your fortune-telling day are over, now!)
8204 : (I-I beg you, Your Mercifulness! I submit myself to all forthcoming punishment, but please hear out my words! Consider this the final wish of a condemned man!)
8205 : (Spare me excuse! Your head roll now!)
8206 : (T-Tavnazia...it concerns Tavnazia's defensive walls!)
8207 : ...
8208 : (The strength of the Marquisate's walls is such that they are oft compared to iron. 'Tis common knowledge that they have been the source of endless vexation for our main force.)
8209 : (What you say?)
8210 : (I have a plan, O Mighty Doggvdegg... A plan to demolish the very walls that have stymied our army for the longest time.)
8211 : (It would be my pleasure to share the details with my lord, but doing so requires that my head remain intact.)
8212 : (Hmph... You smooth-talk your way out of punishment yet again. But fail me once more, I rip out your tongue.)
8213 : (Th-thank you, my lord! I shan't disappoint you again! Now, if you'd but accompany me to Vunkerl Inlet, it is there that the driving force of my strategy lies in wait.)
8214 : The Vunkerl Inlet... Captain, I like the sound of this not one bit. What could Zogbog possibly be scheming this time?
8215 : Rahal, this situation is well over our heads. Best we hasten back and report this development to the bearded brute.
8216 : ...I have a plan. We split up into two groups.
8217 : Machegue, I need you to rejoin the Iron Rams. Return with them to San d'Oria and deliver word to General Cousseraux.
8218 : Yes, sir! Leave it to me, sir!
8219 : Myself, Cyranuce, and % will make for Vunkerl Inlet.
8220 : The three of us will stay on Zogbog's trail and try to learn what we can of his latest machination.
8221 : (Ah! %, to me!)
8222 : (Look thither. It appears we've found Zogbog before Excenmille did.)
8223 : (Let us stay in hiding and observe for now.)
8224 : (Hmm. The pupils are dilated...which means the sedative is working as intended, I trust?)
8225 : (Yes, Master Zogbog.)
8226 : (This here makes the fourth.)
8227 : (Unlike the first three we sent prior, this one is yet a stripling among behemoths. But what it lacks in size, it makes up for in sheer foulness of temperament. I pity the poor souls hiding behind Tavnazia's walls when this one is set loose.)
8228 : (Hm? What's this?)
8229 : (Most curious... Even in this semi-conscious state, its primal instincts drive it to seek and discern the scent of prey. To think that such a fearsome predator is at our disposal... Mwahahahaha...)
8230 : (You. Come closer.)
8231 : Ahem! Ga-ha-ha-ha-ha! At long last the preparations are complete! Now then! Without further ado, send forth myself and the last of our mighty behemoths, so that we may lay waste to Tavnazia!
8232 : (I try, Master Zogbog...)
8233 : Hm? That light...
8234 : Excenmille, stay back! It's a trap!
8235 : Damn! We were too late!
8236 : Sir Jayramus! What was that light?
8237 : 'Twas some manner of teleportation magic. A short-ranged one, to be sure, as no spell exists that can effectively transport massive creatures like that behemoth over any considerable distance.
8238 : But our primary concern now is Excenmille. He, too, was swallowed up into the teleportation rift.
8239 : In all logic, they should not be far from here. Best we split up and search the area.
8240 : Hm? What are you doing? Now is not the time for this tomfoolery!
8241 : Hush! I hear something... The spine-chilling roar of beasts...and a flurry of footfalls...
8242 : Those crafty fiends! They're directly below us!
8243 : The Orcs have made a hiding place out of the Gromil Caverns beneath Jugner Forest. I'm sure of it.
8244 : Gromil Caverns?
8245 : In our youth, Count Aurchiat and I would oft steal away from the safety of the city walls and explore its labyrinthine network of caves.
8246 : If memory serves me correctly, the entrance should be somewhere nearby.
8247 : Are you certain you can find it again after all these years?
8248 : Some things one never forgets, lad. Another detail I've not forgotten is that the caverns are riddled with steep climbs and treacherous footing. We will need a good length of rope to negotiate our way.
8249 : The ivy growing in these parts seems fairly sturdy. What if we gathered some and wove them into a makeshift rope?
8250 : You're sharp for your years, lad. Mayhap great things can be expected of you.
8251 : You two, go and find us some Jugner ivy. I'll be scouting the cavern entrance for enemy presence in the meantime.
8252 : Here, you might be needing this.
8253 : I haven't spares, though, so make it count.
8254 : Hasten back here as soon as you've found some ivy.
8255 : Cardinal Stag Knight Jayramus bids you find some Jugner ivy.
8256 : You've found us an ample amount of ivy, I see. Well done.
8257 : I, too, have managed to locate the entrance to the Gromil Caverns. However...
8258 : However...?
8259 : The Orcs have gone and erected a pair of guard posts in the vicinity.
8260 : What!?
8261 : No need to fret, lad. Both seemed to have been abandoned, or perhaps the occupants are in the midst of a patrol. I doubt we need to pay them much mind, but I thought to mention it nevertheless. Let us away.
8262 : We're here.
8263 : Hmm... The area seems clear of enemy lookouts.
8264 : By the Goddess... I never knew such an expansive cavern existed here.
8265 : I would offer a picturesque tour of the environs, but that must wait until after we've secured Excenmille.
8266 : Blast it! Not this place again!
8267 : That Zogbog... Where could he have gone?
8268 : You seek an audience with me, Lord Excenmille?
8269 : !?
8270 : Show yourself, craven!
8271 : As it please you, my lord. But be warned that the odds are heavily stacked against you. Gahahahaha!
8272 : Y-your ploy to unnerve me will not succeed, fiend! I'm a knight and defender of the Kingdom, and son of Alphonimile M Aurchiat! The blood of heroes courses through my veins! Come, do your worst!
8273 : That roar!? A behemoth is near!
8274 : Son...? Ah, yes, I remember that word. After all, I too was once a son. I had a father and mother, and siblings whom I grew up alongside. Life was hard, but I knew peace and contentment nonetheless. Who could ask for more?
8275 : But one day, without warning, all of this was taken away from me. My village was razed to the ground, and my entire family, put to the sword in an unprovoked attack by a band of intruders led by a merciless savage.
8276 : I can hear an Orc speaking! We're close!
8277 : What are you blabbering on about? None of this concerns me!
8278 : Doesn't concern you, you say? Oh, but it will. For mine is a revenge that traverses time...
8279 : Traverses time? What is this nonsense?
8280 : You will find out soon enough.
8281 : Hmph! If it's of revenge you wish to speak, then I'll have you know mine! You and your loathsome Bloodwing Horde are the ones who murdered Mother! This much I know!
8282 : !!!
8283 : Gahaha... Gahahahahaha! Why, I suppose this makes the two of us rivals in revenge! How cruel and ironic the heavens can be!
8284 : This changes everything. Now that we're properly acquainted, we can do away with all the pleasantries.
8285 : Go, my pretty!
8286 : Go forth and crush the life and future out of that puny Elvaan!
8287 : Excenmille!
8288 : Save the tearful reunion for afterwards! The enemy comes!
8289 : (Pre...preposterous. How could a behemoth be felled by a pair of ordinary soldiers and mere children?)
8290 : C-curses!
8291 : We're not done yet, Zogbog!
8292 : Excenmille! No!
8293 : Confound it! The semblance that child bears to his late mother can be insufferable at times!
8294 : <Pant, pant>... Prepare yourself, Zogbog! We finish this now!
8295 : (Ack! Is this the end...?)
8296 : (I come to see commotion. Who I find but you, Zogbog!)
8297 : (G-General Doggvdegg!)
8298 : (You flee from handful of pointy-ear!?)
8299 : (Be deceived not by their numbers, my lord. These four alone slew one of our fiercest behemoths.)
8300 : (What you say!?)
8301 : I say, the situation grows grimmer by the second...
8302 : First, a foul-tempered young behemoth, and now, a whole herd of bloodthirsty pigmen--all within the span of an hour. I shan't soon forget this day...
8303 : Doggvdegg...
8304 : Hold it!
8305 : Huh!?
8306 : Father!?
8307 : (Pointy-ear cavalry!? Where they come from!?)
8308 : Maintain close formation, valiant Knights of the Cardinal Stag! Chaaarge!
8309 : (Grrr! Take battle to enemy and fight like Orc! Try to run, I slay you myself!)
8310 : (Master Zogbog! Dire news!)
8311 : ...
8312 : (What did you say!?)
8313 : (Gahahaha! Enemy are very few! We encircle and demolish!)
8314 : (General!)
8315 : ...
8316 : (What!? Reinforcement from San d'Oria!? How they come so fast!?)
8317 : (This position is indefensible, my lord! Lingering here would equate to suicide!)
8318 : (Hmph! You speak obvious! Bloodwing Horde, we withdraw!)
8319 : Excenmille! Go no further!
8320 : !?
8321 : A pursuit order has not been issued, soldier. Stay here and tend to the wounded.
8322 : But why, Father!? That was Doggvdegg, the Orc who murdered Mother!
8323 : I said, tend to the wounded! This is an order!
8324 : Damn it!
8325 : It would seem I am forming an atrocious habit of relying on you, %.
8326 : At the very least, I believe I owe you the courtesy of sharing what was written in the letter from Rongelouts.
8327 : The letter simply reads thus: Disquieting rumors surround Tavnazia. Expedite elimination of behemoth.
8328 : A cryptic message, to be sure, but the friendship that I hold dear between myself and Rongelouts demanded that I heed these words. Thus, I gathered my knights and made my way here.
8329 : And what should the faith I placed in an old comrade gain me, but the life of one of my knights and heir to House Aurchiat both?
8330 : Thanking Rongelouts is the first thing I shall do upon return to San d'Oria.
8331 : Cyranuce.
8332 : Hm?
8333 : About Machegue...
8334 : Say not another word!
8335 : You envy that Machegue fulfilled our shared childhood dream of becoming a knight before any of us.
8336 : That's what you meant to say. Am I right?
8337 : Yes, Cyranuce...that's exactly right.
8338 : %.
8339 : You've saved my neck yet again.
8340 : This time, Father is resolute in his mission to go to Tavnazia's aid, no matter what fate may await us there.
8341 : Boy! There'll be time enough to prattle with friends by the fireplace when you've become a wrinkly old man! We leave now!
8342 : I continue on the expedition. But come what may, I want the two of you to survive. Also...
8343 : Rahal, right? We'll be sure to pass your regards on to him, and brag about our most recent exploits in the process.
8344 : Thank you...and farewell!
8345 : Let us return to San d'Oria, %. Pain my heart though it may, I must be the one to tell Mother of Machegue's fate.
8346 : Nothing happens...
8347 : You see the tracks of a three-taloned, dog-like beast on the ground. They appear to be territorial markings...
8348 : Haha!!! You're mine now, you pompous crown-wearing feline!
8349 : ...Huh?
8350 : %!?
8351 : What do you think you're doing, wandering into the trap I'd laid out for that furball Cait Sith!?
8352 : <Sigh>... Well, don't just lie there like a dolt. Up with you! Up!
8353 : And who have we here?
8354 : Be this a friend of yours, Lili?
8355 : Ooh, I recognize [him/her]! [He/She]'s the one we snagged in Ronfaure the other day!
8356 : Eh? You've been busy cozying up with this hunk of a man here, Lili, but never thought to tell us?
8357 : <Gasp>! Our ferocious, fang-baring Lili's finally managed to bag herself a...boyfriend!? And look, not even the slightest hint of a broken nose or dislocated jaw on him!
8358 : H-hey, stop jumping to deluded conclusions!
8359 : So, you're a friend of Lili's, eh?
8360 : But, my... I don't know how I failed to notice before, but you're absolutely gorgeous!
8361 : You should seriously consider signing up for our dance troupe. All the men would fight tooth and nail just for a gander at a stunner like you on stage!
8362 : Hear, hear! Our dance troupe is the greatest. You get to travel to all sorts of exotic destinations, with board and lodging guaranteed! Win enough hearts, and a lucrative endorsement deal wouldn't be far-fetched, either!
8363 : H-hey, stop planting crazy ideas into %'s head!
8364 : Hmph! I've suffered enough of your overactive imaginations for one day! I can handle the rest by myself, so get back to San d'Oria, the whole lot of you! Troupe dismissed!
8365 : Awww...
8366 : Well, we've been out here for too long as it is. Any longer, and the boss'll be screaming for the hides off our backs.
8367 : Agreed! A break from this catty obsession would do you a world of good, too, Lili.
8368 : And one more thing, before I forget. Don't you think using fish as bait to catch a cat is a wee bit...cliched?
8369 : A-away with you!
8370 : <Sigh>... %, I trust it is still your intention to honor the promise you made?
8371 : The promise to help me capture Cait Sith and save Sir Ragelise...
8372 : After which, we make our long-awaited intercontinental debut as the professional tag-team duo, Future Fabulous?
8373 : Will you honor your promise? I surely will. Um, may I review the contract...?
8374 : Great! I never doubted you for a second, %! Now, with me! We're staking out that bumptious feline...
8375 : Review what!? You've already given me your word, and that's the last I'll hear of it! Now, with me! We're staking out that bumptious feline...
8376 : ...
8377 : ......
8378 : She's nowhere to be seen...
8379 : Are we doing something wrong? Perhaps the bait is too...cliched, like Tanja suggested?
8380 : %, do you think we ought to try something different as bait?
8381 : Try a new bait? It might be for the best. Cats love fish, right?
8382 : Alright... But, what else would be worth trying?
8383 : Naturally! Why did I ever doubt myself?
8384 : But still, that doesn't rule out the possibility that something more effective exists.
8385 : I've an idea. Let's review the intelligence we've gathered on our target so far. After all, knowing the enemy is half the battle!
8386 : Now, %. What manner of creature do you think Cait Sith actually is?
8387 : What is Cait Sith? A cat of unknown breed. A Mithran child. A cat, yet, not a cat.
8388 : Hmmm, I see... Moving on, what do you think her paw pads feel like to the touch?
8389 : Cait Sith's paw pads are... Irresistibly soft. Tautly firm. Unpleasantly coarse.
8390 : Uh-huh... Next, what do you think she likes?
8391 : What does Cait Sith like best? High places. The almighty gil. Culinary delights.
8392 : Hmmm, I thought as much... That reminds me, what color are her eyes again?
8393 : Cait Sith's eyes are... Blue, like the summer sky. Yellow, like the setting sun. Green, with envy.
8394 : What kind of noise does she make when she cries?
8395 : How does Cait Sith cry? Kupoarrr. Grrrowl. Meowww.
8396 : From my recollections of her appearance, I can't shake the feeling that something's missing... But, what could that something possibly be?
8397 : What does Cait Sith lack, appearance-wise? Cuteness. Savageness. A pair of knee-high bottes.
8398 : I see, I see...
8399 : Based on your answers, I've concluded that to lure out Cait Sith, we should use...
8400 : % as bait!
8401 : While cats undeniably love fish, surely they find tender cuts of meat just as, if not more, appealing!
8402 : Considering the fancy-shmancy crown she likes to wear atop its ridiculously disproportionate head, I should've guessed that Cait Sith is a slave to worldly riches. Our victory is as good as sealed the instant she casts her greedy eyes on our glimmering, golden bait!
8403 : Cats are incurably playful creatures, and Cait Sith is no exception! An instinct-driven pounce upon a seemingly harmless toy--our bait--will be her undoing!
8404 : Now, %, your task is to fetch %.
8405 : I'll have a new trap rigged up and ready to go by the time you come back.
8406 : You see numerous sets of elegant footprints.
8407 : Lilisette is preparing a new trap in an attempt to catch the ever-elusive Cait Sith. Bring her % to use as bait.
8408 : Lilisette's questions: #.
8409 : %, you're finally back!
8410 : We'll have the cat in the bag at long last. Heheheheheh...
8411 : She's here!
8412 : Oh?
8413 : And what might this be, hmmm?
8414 : M-meow!?
8415 : Hissssss!!!
8416 : I have you now!
8417 : Wh-what is the meaning of this!? Release me, I say! Catch and release!
8418 : Not a chance, cat! I have many questions, and you'll oblige me with the answers if you know what's good for you.
8419 : I want to know all about what happened at La Vaule...and more!
8422 : Wh-what are you talking about? Haven't a clue.
8423 : Heheheheheh...
8424 : Don't play the fool with me, cat! You're really trying what little patience I have!
8425 : Owww, it hurts! Aaah, the pain!
8426 : You have the ability to manipulate time, don't you? Take us back to before when the incident at La Vaule occurred!
8427 : I must go back and save Fath--I mean, Sir Ragelise! Please!
8428 : ...?
8429 : Ah, I understand now! Finally clear! The insolent young slip of a girl Naoi mentioned!
8430 : ...?
8431 : Now it all makes sense. Falling into place.
8432 : Sorry, but your plight is not our concern. Falling on deaf ears.
8433 : For our own reasons did we open Atomos.
8434 : You're little more than playing pieces on a chess board. Pieces to be pla--
8435 : Need I remind you of the position you're in now? I suggest you choose your words with greater tact!
8436 : And don't think I've forgotten about what your swiping claws did to my immaculate complexion! I'm holding you accountable should this disfiguration cause ticket sales to slump!
8437 : Ugh...let go... Losing...consciousness...
8438 : Now, listen to me! If we don't save Father, the Crystal War will be lost!
8439 : Don't you see? Father--Ragelise B Baloumat--is supposed to go down in history as the hero of the Battle of Jeuno! Without his deeds, the battle would not have ended in favor of the Allied Forces!
8440 : The Battle...
8441 : Of...
8442 : Jeu...
8443 : ...No?
8444 : Was everyone able to catch all of that? Were you tuned in?
8445 : Uwaaah!?
8446 : One, two, three... Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!?
8447 : You again? Quite the nuisance you're proving to be. A proverbial thorn in the side.
8448 : Ah, they must be the ones Naoi spoke of. Had a run in.
8449 : Why do you insist on impeding our mission so? Make difficult our nine lives?
8450 : Look! Just help Sir Ragelise already!
8451 : Yes, yes, with regards to that matter... That Ragelise B Baloumat could be the hero of the Battle of Jeuno! Adorned with shiny, shiny medals!
8452 : Hmmm...
8453 : Seems like a meeting is in order. Time for a discussion.
8454 : All caits, assemble! Gather 'round!
8455 : The Battle of Jeuno of which the girl speaks...
8456 : Is the battle which proves to be the turning point in the Crystal War, is it not? The pivotal moment?
8457 : A curious possibility. Positively curious.
8458 : Can she be trusted? Her words hold truth? Could they be...the Champions of the Dawn?
8459 : Perhaps we should assist them. Lend a helping hand.
8460 : Nyahahahaha! The lot of you, so easily fooled. Quick to take the bait. Give me one reason why we should trust that girl.
8461 : I'm of the same opinion. Make scratching posts out of them, I say. A little stress relief.
8462 : Now, now, Coig. Violence is the first resort of the incompetent. No harm in hearing them out. Let them have a say.
8463 : Yes, yes, let them tell us about that underwear fellow. Lingerie.
8464 : That's Ragelise, Naoi. Ra-ge-lise.
8465 : Ah, yes, an unusual name. Should this Ragelise be a playing piece on our side of the board, it would be a shame not to exploit him. A wasted resource.
8466 : Hmmm... A befuddling dilemma of sorts. A sort of dilemma.
8467 : Hey, aren't you finished yet!?
8468 : Silence, impatient one! Distract us not from our discussion. Discussing a distraction.
8469 : Hmph, very well, then. Let me know as soon as your little meeting's over, you hear?
8470 : The mission's fulfillment, none need be reminded, is our utmost priority. Must stay the course.
8471 : So long as it serves to succor the children of Altana...
8472 : Hmm...all valid arguments. Let's settle the matter with a vote. Settle once and for all.
8473 : All those in favor of lending a hand to the girl and Ragie?
8474 : One, two, three, four... Thank you kindly.
8475 : And those in favor of minding our own business?
8476 : One, two, three, four...
8477 : Errr...oh?
8478 : Silly, silly Naoi! You've gone and forgotten to vote! Didn't raise your hand!
8479 : Oh? Didn't I?
8480 : Enough, enough! All this bickering will avail us naught.
8481 : I've a thought. Tell them, we should, of the thing that can be got from the lake yonder, and then move on. Be on our merry way.
8482 : Ah, a grand idea! We wise them up to its existence. Let them know.
8483 : ...But, what's the thing?
8484 : Suffering from old age-induced forgetfulness, are we? Going grey about the ears? The thing is none other than the % that can be found by the lakeside here. Makes a good medicine, it does.
8485 : Impressive! I'll be sure to keep that in mind!
8486 : Yes, yes, save the knowledge for a rainy day. We tell the girl where it can be obtained, and the rest is entirely up to her. Her entirely. And, oh...?
8487 : Don't mind me, folks. Carry on.
8488 : Nyaaaaaah!?
8489 : Awww, don't run away! Wait!
8490 : Gyaaaaaah!
8491 : Let go, you big brute! Unhand me!
8492 : <Slurp> Wh-what was that!?
8493 : Easy, now. I may not look it, but I'm actually an avid cat enthusiast. Honest!
8494 : N-no...stop it...don't you dare...
8495 : It-it's him!
8496 : Awww, such adorable little creatures... Makes it all the harder to dispose of you all as Haudrale commanded.
8497 : Tell you what. Promise to become my loyal pet in place of Galarhigg, and I'll let you live.
8498 : What say you, hm? Have we a deal?
8499 : I...I...
8500 : I'd rather choke to death on my own fur ball!
8501 : <Sigh>... That was the heartbreaking reply I so wanted not to hear.
8502 : Aaah! How could they have known of this location!? Been made aware!?
8503 : Naoi, you mustn't! You'll only fall into his hands as well!
8504 : Ochd! Dha! Noooooo!
8505 : Awww...the others managed to escape. Haudrale is going to throw a monstrous fit when he learns of this.
8506 : Wh-what he just did to those cats...
8507 : But, why?
8508 : Aren't they supposed to be in league with each other?
8509 : Hmm? You two...
8510 : You're the ones who tormented my Galarhigg, aren't you? Don't even think to deny it.
8511 : Y-you're one to talk! Father had to live out his days in agonizing pain because of what you did!
8512 : ...
8513 : Poor Galarhigg...
8514 : People who mistreat innocent creatures... People like you...
8515 : Must be made to pay!!!
8516 : %, be at the ready!

8518 : Y-yes, Haudrale?
8519 : Sorry, sorry. I had a few unanticipated problems fall plop into my lap, but everything's sorted now. I'll be reporting back soon.
8520 : I won't be bringing any stray kittens back with me, if that's what you're thinking. The felines have been tended to, as you ordered.
8521 : (Well, just two of them, to be exact...)
8522 : Hmph... Looks like you get to live to see another sunrise.
8523 : I must say, you two are a curious pair. What is it that you hope to gain, taking the crazed mewlings of those cats to heart?
8524 : But you're free to do as you please, of course. Be seeing you!
8525 : ...Just what is he, exactly?
8526 : Never mind that for now. The mystery object the cats were discussing...
8527 : Makes a good medicine, one of them said.
8528 : Wait. I'm remembering something.
8529 : When I was but a little girl, Father seemed to always have a small bottle on his person, from which he often took sips.
8530 : Could that have been the medicine he was taking for the wound?
8531 : I have to go and find out.

8695 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
8696 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
8697 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
8698 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
8699 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
8700 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
8701 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
8702 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
8703 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
8704 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
8705 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
8706 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
8707 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
8708 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
8709 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
8710 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
8711 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
8712 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
8713 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
8714 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
8715 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
8716 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
8717 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
8718 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
8719 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
8720 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
8721 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
8722 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
8723 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
8724 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
8725 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
8726 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
8727 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
8728 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
8729 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
8730 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
8731 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
8732 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
8733 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
8734 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
8735 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
8736 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%
