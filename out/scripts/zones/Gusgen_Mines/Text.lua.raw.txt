6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7400 : Here's what we want you to do: defeat the creatures that are infesting the scrap materials, then take the evidence of their destruction to Raifa.
7401 : We have prepared an ointment to rub on your skin that will lure the creatures out of hiding.
7402 : They've left track marks all over the place, especially around H-6.
7403 : The effect of this ointment will last for about a day. If it wears off, or you want to have it removed earlier, come back here and talk to me.

7406 : Well, if you change your mind...

7410 : Lemme see that... Huh, %. Take it on back to Raifa. She'll be waiting for you in Bastok.
7411 : Hmmm?
7412 : What do you desire? Nothing. To have the ointment removed. To reconfirm where I'm going.
7413 : This looks like a pile of scrap materials.
7414 : The ointment's odor draws out the monsters!
7415 : A pile of scrap materials...
7416 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7417 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7418 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.

7485 : The % has been enriched to its maximum level!
7486 : The atmacite's enrichment level failed to rise...
7487 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
7488 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
7489 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
7490 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
7491 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
7492 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
7493 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
7494 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
7495 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
7496 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
7497 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
7498 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
7499 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
7500 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
7501 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
7502 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
7503 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
7504 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
7505 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
7506 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
7507 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
7508 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
7509 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
7510 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
7511 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
7512 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
7513 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
7514 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
7515 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
7516 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
7517 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
7518 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
7519 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
7520 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
7521 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
7522 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
7523 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
7524 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
7525 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
7526 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
7527 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
7528 : % expends % and increases [blue/red/yellow/green] spectral alignment by #%! Current value: +#%

11470 : My name is Sverdhried, and I leave this aural record for any rune fencers ingenious enough to activate this instrument.
11471 : I stumbled upon this specific one while blindly running my hand along the walls of this tight and deep cavern to keep from losing my way. After trying a number of runes on the device, I conclude that it has an affinity for Flabra.
11472 : Flabra, if you don't already know, is the rune of gales. Its gusts fear not the staunch and unforgiving ground, boring chasms as they proceed downward with nary a hindrance.
11473 : Apropos of nothing, I'd like to add that I also learned the ways of the blacksmith in order to forge swords worthy of the strength I have attained.
11474 : Thus, I can say with the utmost confidence that I know an exceptional piece of ore when I see one.
11475 : These shafts abound with some of the finest ore chunks I have ever laid eyes upon, which leads me to believe this area must be one colossal ore deposit.
11476 : It perplexes me how most of it remains untouched, for one only needs to dig the puniest of holes for iron and gold to practically begin pouring out.
11477 : If you have even the slightest interest in such affairs, I suggest you unstrap your pickaxe and get to digging. My time here is limited, however, and I must soon go where the winds of adventure take me.
11478 : Oh, or maybe Flabra could prove useful in your excavations...as long as you're able to use it.
11479 : I make no guarantees as to how long the veins will spew forth their mineral lifeblood, so don't go blaming me if they run out as soon as you start!

11509 : How do you respond? I'm %! I'm a friend of Dazbog's. I'm a friend of Magh Bihu's.
11510 : Mee nev'r heer of yee.
11511 : Is that the tr'th? Yee bee his follow'r or somethin'?
11512 : Magh Bihu... Hee Dazbog's underling, yes?
11513 : It took me a long time to say goodbye to all of my kin.
11514 : It seems like there are even more of them now too.
11515 : Yer Magh Bihu? Yee bee Lord Dazbog's follow'r, so where 'ave yee been?
11516 : I'm no follower! Like I said, I'm his friend!
11517 : Whatever... It's pointless to speak to any Meebles other than Dazbog.
11518 : Well, I'm here now! Take me to Dazbog at once!
11519 : Lord Dazbog is veeery busy. Mee doubt hee 'ave time fer yee.
11520 : Mee check wit' him, so yee wait 'ere for now.
11521 : Ahem!
11522 : Make way fer Lord Dazbog!
11523 : Urk!
11524 : Ahem! Greetings, fine citizens!
11525 : Not this again! Playing at king, are you, Dazbog?
11526 : I'm not trying to be a king, more like a proper nobleman.
11527 : It doesn't matter. I have something important to discuss with you.
11528 : According to % here...
11529 : Ahem! I object!
11530 : Huh!? What are you talking about!?
11531 : %, my 101st follower...
11532 : Have you not brought proper tribute for your lord?
11533 : Did you bring tribute? Yes, it's right here. Sorry, not this time.
11534 : You should not lie to me. I do not detect any scent of a tribute.
11535 : I shall not grant you an audience without the proper tribute.
11536 : I was told the same thing when I came here with Gloom Phantom.
11537 : That was the first time I met Dazbog.
11538 : We were traveling the land, talking about the World Eater Eggs and recruiting allies.
11539 : However, we were constantly turned away and weren't having the best of luck.
11540 : Eventually, we ended up here and found someone who knew about the Prime Weapon.
11541 : So that is why I worked so hard alongside Gloom Phantom here.
11542 : However, it was always a mystery to know what to bring as tribute. We were constantly forced to bring something else.
11543 : No good! Try again! I heard those words countless times...
11544 : Wait... Maybe I'm thinking of something else?
11545 : Ahem! Now then, my 101st follower... I look forward to what you will bring me.
11546 : Well, I suppose we have no choice but to play along with Dazbog's little game again.
11547 : We should be okay if we bring him a number of % like last time.
11548 : If we bring him #, I think His Lordship will be satisfied!
11549 : In case you're wondering, this is supposed to be a tribute from His Lordship's 101st follower. So you can leave me out of this.
11550 : I think I'll try and catch some sun while I'm waiting!
11551 : If yee 'ave business with Lord Dazbog, yee must bring prop'r tribute.
11552 : Mee wish dat all 101 follow'rs could come. I'd like to dig 'oles wit theeem...
11553 : <Drool>... This bee a delicacy for Meebles big and smaaall alike!
11554 : Wait 'ere. I sh'll inform Lord Dazbog.
11555 : Ahem!
11556 : Make way fer Lord Dazbog!
11557 : Ahem! Greetings, fine citizens!
11558 : Not this again!
11559 : Well, my 101st follower? Let's see what you have brought me!
11560 : Firstly, you may take your reward! I have no objections to your tribute!
11561 : Does this mean he'll listen to us now?
11562 : There is no need.
11563 : What did you say!?
11564 : I already know what you desire. You need my strength to help in your quest.
11565 : Hedrov, it seems I must set out on a journey once again. Give the message to the rest of my devoted followers.
11566 : Lord Dazbog, this all bee rather sudd'n!
11567 : This journey is needed to protect the peace. Now then, let's get to it...
11568 : S-sorry, everyone. I imagine y-you're somewhat surprised...
11569 : I'm glad to see you're back to your old self, my lord.
11570 : I-I have to act regal if I'm to lead my f-followers...
11571 : Meebles are rather sheltered from the world, due to living mostly underground and all.
11572 : As such, there are many who take advantage of them and their naive nature!
11573 : Moblins also live underground, but they're particularly bad.
11574 : They consider it their right to push the Meebles around.
11575 : Th-that's why I want to change things. However, it's not s-so easy...
11576 : M-Meebles tend to follow the Meeble in f-front of them when digging.
11577 : Th-they all copy each other, so they all end up doing the s-same thing...
11578 : S-so they listen to the Moblins and it b-becomes second nature for everyone to follow their orders.
11579 : E-even if I tell them what they're doing is wrong, they don't g-get it right away...
11580 : I suppose it takes a while before they'll listen only to Your Lordship.
11581 : Th-that's why I have to pretend that I have so many f-followers...
11582 : I-if I change their usual routine, m-maybe I can help improve their lives...
11583 : As a mandragora, I don't really understand the whole thing. However, best of luck to you.
11584 : Gloom Phantom also said it's important to believe in oneself.
11585 : Although, despite those words, she has betrayed us all.
11586 : B-betrayed us? Actually, wh-what are you doing here, Magh Bihu?
11587 : I came because we've got trouble.
11588 : Wh-whaaat!?
11589 : I-I'm so happy to hear that Gloom Phantom is b-better after sustaining those injuries!
11590 : I know, right?
11591 : B-but why is she working together with the undead?
11592 : I-I simply don't understand...
11593 : I know, right?
11594 : I thought we should ask her ourselves, so that's why I came to get you.
11595 : L-let's go! To M-Movalpolos, at once!
11596 : You too, %!
11597 : Mee countin' on yee to look 'fter Lord Dazbog and his 100 follow'rs.
11598 : Mee didn't heer where hee bee goin', but best guess is Movalpolos...
11599 : I'm Hedrov. Yee bee his lordship's 101st follow'r.
11600 : Are yee busy aaat the mom'nt? Grow out yer nails and mee will teach yee 'ow to dig a 'ole.
11601 : I'm Hedrov. Yee bee the 101st follow'r, yes!?
11602 : Lord Dazbog... Err, I mean King Dazbog!
11603 : The oth'r day, he was visit'd by a mighty demon. Hee defint'ly bee His Majesty's 102nd follow'r!
11604 : This demon broug't an impress've crown and Dazbog bee nam'd king!
11605 : Ahem! Greetings, fine citizens!
11606 : Make way fer King Dazbog!
11607 : Come now, there's no need for such formality!
11608 : O-oh, have you already heard from H-Hedrov?
11609 : I-I received the revered King Tarov's crown as a gift from Odin.
11610 : I-it is said to be a rather splendid piece, once worn by an ancient M-Meeble king.
11611 : I-it used various rare and valuable crystals.
11612 : O-once I put it on my head, I didn't feel the need to pretend to be all regal.
11613 : I-it shines so brightly, it just looks like an item only someone of a-authority would wear!
11614 : A-appearances are important...
11615 : I-I hear that the Meeble king is now residing in V-Valhalla.
11616 : D-do you think he also f-fought against Chaos?
11617 : I-I was shocked when I heard what he had a-accomplished...
11618 : H-he dug all kinds of new roads underneath the g-ground.
11619 : F-furthermore, he discovered all kinds of new stones and j-jewels too.
11620 : H-however, he gave all of them to any beastman that w-wanted them.
11621 : H-he was able to traverse those countless underground roads alongside countless beastmen...
11622 : Y-yet he didn't ever ask for anything in r-return.
11623 : O-one day, though, there was a great t-tragedy.
11624 : M-many strong beastmen bearing powerful weapons came to h-help.
11625 : I-it wasn't out of gratitude nor obligation, but m-merely to protect the stones, jewels, and the convenience offered by the roads.
11626 : Still, it's because of his efforts that the M-Meeble have continued to thrive to this day.
11627 : A-at least, that's what I was t-told.
11628 : Th-the Meeble king was that k-kind of individual. I-I feel as if my eyes have been opened.
11629 : I-I vow to become that kind of k-king as well.
11630 : King Dazbog is gener'us to tee people and his loy'l subj'cts. Hee certain to bee legend'ry king!
11631 : Yee bee King Dazbog's 101st follow'r. Use this and tell every'ne of his wonderf'l deeds!
11632 : Th-this is kind of embarrassing...
11633 : I-I'll do my best to find something useful for your kind, so you'll agree to help the M-Meebles too.
11634 : O-once I find it, you'll be the f-first to know.
11635 : I'm Hedrov. Yee bee the 101st follow'r.
11636 : Mee have the item King Dazbog prepar'd fer yee.
11637 : I'm Hedrov. Yee bee the 101st follow'r.
11638 : Tee crown looks wonderf'l on King Dazbog's head!
