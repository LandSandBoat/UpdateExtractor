6931 : (DEBUG) Flag raised, kupo!
6932 : Welcome, Master! This is your home, the Mog House, kupo!
6933 : I'm a moogle! We moogles like taking care of houses and items! Nice to meet you, kupo!
6934 : I'll tell you all about your Mog House, kupo!
6935 : First, the basics, kupo! Open your main menu, Master. The button at the very bottom changes to Mog House when you're in your Mog House, kupo!
6936 : Press it and the Mog House menu will appear! Everything you can do in your Mog House is there, kupo!
6937 : There are lots of things you can do in your Mog House, kupo! It can be too much for some masters, kupo...
6938 : So I'll teach you about each one of them! Ask me what you want to know about, kupo!
6939 : Choose the Mog House command you want to know about, kupo!
6940 : What do you want to know about? The Mog Safe. Storage. The Delivery Box. Changing jobs. Gardening. Changing the layout. Mog House invitations. I got it, thanks, kupo!
6941 : The Mog Safe is where I keep items that you can't carry! It's an especially secure and solid safe, kupo!
6942 : You can only put so many items in it, kupo... But I'll guard them even if it means my life, kupo!
6943 : The Delivery Box is where you can send letters to friends and receive items from various places, kupo!
6944 : You should take the items from your Delivery Box and put them in your inventory when they arrive, kupo!
6945 : If your Delivery Box is full, no more deliveries can be made, and you can't send any mail either, kupo!
6946 : You can send items and gil to your friends with the Send command, kupo!
6947 : (Sometimes, if a special force takes hold, you can even deliver items with the "Exclusive" attribute, kupo...!)
6948 : Changing people's jobs is a secret ability only we moogles can use, kupo!
6949 : I take off all your equipment and take you to a mysterious place, kupo!
6950 : And...the rest is a secret, kupo!
6951 : All moogles like taking care of plants, kupo!
6952 : As long as you have a flowerpot and seeds, I'll make it my personal responsibility to look after the plants you raise, kupo!
6953 : This Mog House is your very own room, kupo! But it's still a little bare, kupo...
6954 : It needs some furniture and maybe some paintings to make it more cozy, kupo!
6955 : If you find any during your travels, I'll help you lay them out, kupo! I can't wait, kupo!
6956 : Storage space becomes available when you place furniture in your Mog House using the Layout command, kupo!

6959 : You can show off your expensive furniture, have tea parties, plan your next great adventure--the possibilities are endless, kupo!

6961 : Are you sure? I'm sure! Maybe I'm not so sure...
6962 : And finally, a little bit of advice!
6963 : If you ever run into any problems, just ask your fellow adventurers for help!
6964 : If you type /ae Hello!, then your message will be heard by many people.
6965 : If you type /ae followed by your issue or question, other adventurers will help you!
6966 : Remember that you can only do this while in town, kupo!
6967 : Okay, kupo! Good luck on your adventuring, kupo!
6968 : Do you want me to teach you about your Mog House again, kupo?
6969 : Ask about your Mog House again? Don't ask. Ask.
6970 : Over the mountains and the rolling hills, I'll go wherever my master wills.
6971 : Master! I traveled all the way here at your bidding, kupo! Even a Rent-a-Room needs a moogle, kupo!
6972 : But there are a few things you can't do in a Rent-a-Room, kupo. Select Mog House from the main menu and check, kupo!
6973 : When you go back home, talk to the guard in front of the residential area to call me back to the Mog House, kupo!
6974 : Master! I have something to tell you, kupo!
6975 : I found this precious item under the % pillow, kupo!
6976 : It's all yours, kupo!
6977 : I used the % to write a song for you, kupo!
6978 : Here, kupo! Please think of the lonely moogle waiting for you back home when you hear this song, kupo!
6979 : I found this item in the back of one of the %'s drawers, kupo!
6980 : It's all yours, kupo!

6988 : This must be what they mean when they say, there are many mysteries behind works of art, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6989 : Something clattered inside the % when I shook it! Look what fell out when I turned it upside down, kupo!
6990 : It's all yours, kupo!
6991 : I felt there was something strange about the %, and when I looked into it, I found this, kupo!
6992 : We moogles have very good intuition, kupo! It's all yours, kupo!
6993 : Oh, Master! You won't believe what I found out on the doorstep this morning, kupo!
6994 : At once so glorious and so ghastly, and just for you! Think of it as a holiday gift from a humble moogle to his favorite (and only) master, kupo!
6995 : For your own safety, it is recommended you set the Mog House exit as your home point after changing jobs.
6996 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [overwhelming/powerful/faint] [fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/dark] energy, kupo!
6997 : Is my assistance reaching you, Master? Your Mog House is currently aglow with [the overwhelming/the powerful/the faint] energy of many different elements, kupo!
6998 : Each item of furniture you place using the Layout command corresponds to a different element, kupo! The type of energy that envelops your Mog House changes depending on those elements, kupo!
6999 : When that energy changes, my powers change as well, kupo! Master, you should try placing all sorts of furniture in your Mog House, kupo!

7008 : It has been wrapped and everything! I wonder who it could be from, kupo!
7009 : Look what I found in your %!

7017 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a man named Gulldago. He's at the West Gate in Bastok Markets, kupo.
7018 : If you haven't already done so, you should go and speak with a woman named Selele. She's at Leviathan's Gate in Windurst Woods, kupo.
7019 : Master! What [an egg-ceptional specimen/egg-ceptional specimens] you have there! Now, if you'll just let me have a look-see, kupo...
7020 : We egg-tach this thingamajig to that thingamabob, just like so, kupo...
7021 : Now for the coup d'egg-grace...!
7022 : Voila! Isn't she a beauty, kupo? Utterly egg-squisite workmanship, I do degg-clare!

7024 : Voila! Your original egg-redients, entirely egg-tact, kupo! If you change your mind, just trade them back to me or one of my moogle egg-sociates!
7025 : Oh, Master, look at this! I was poking around in the drawers of your %, when this % just popped out! I guess you never know what you're going to find until you look for it, kupo!

7032 : Master! Oh, master, look! We've sprung a leak, kupo! Just look at it drip, drip, dripping away!
7033 : What a terribly troubling turn of events, kupo! But have no fear! Sit tight and you'll see why I'm the most renowned handymoogle in the three nations!
7034 : Goddess have mercy on my moogle soul. Look at this mess! Rotting roof boards! Rusted nails, kupo!
7035 : Why, it's a miracle this tottering, tumble-down shanty--I mean, this beautiful abode of yours--is still standing, master!
7036 : Anyhow, this simply won't do, kupo. We must make repairs before we have water up to my little wings!
7037 : I figure all I'll need is a good %, %, and % to have this fixed up good as new, kupo!
7038 : Could I trouble you to track them down? While you're out, I'll patch up the other problem spots.
7039 : And do hurry, Master! Lest you return to find your poor moogle friend lying prostrate in a pernicious puddle of rainwater, kupo...
7040 : Thank you, Master, but our leak is in another Mog House! Bring this to me when we're back home in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst], won't you, kupo?
7041 : You've found them, kupo! I knew I could count on you. That's what I tell all my moogle buddies. Why, my master is the boldest, brightest, bestest master of them all! Now we just take these, and...
7042 : Kupoooooothere you have it! Better than new! Why, a bevy of wild buffalo could barge in here this second and it wouldn't budge an ilm, I say!
7043 : Which reminds me, I went ahead and relayed the requisite reports to my manager at the MHMU.
7044 : But wouldn't you know it, kupo? It seems there's been a trifling bit of trouble at one of our Rent-a-Rooms in Jeuno as well!
7045 : You know the one, right across from Durable Shields. Whatever could have gone wrong, kupo?
7046 : Well, there's nothing to be learned lollygagging around here. Come, Master, we're off to Jeuno!
7047 : Little did anyone suspect that this      would prove to be only the beginning      of a harrowing nightmare unheard of      in the annals of mooglekind...
7048 : Do something? Read instructions. Change parameters. Teleport to key locations. Warp to home point. Receive items. Obtain 100,000,000 gil. Do nothing.

7220 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. I have been appointed by the Guildworkers' Union to manage the trading of manufactured crafts and the exchange of guild points.
7221 : However, to assure product quality, I cannot carry out any business with those who rank lower than novice.
7222 : I see that you currently have a trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild. I'm sorry, but I cannot do any business with you.
7223 : You do have the option to terminate your contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and form one with us.
7224 : After signing a new contract, you will have to wait until the next delivery phase to trade Guildworkers' Union requested items.
7225 : Create a new contract with us? Immediately. Not today.
7226 : Are you certain? I said, Immediately. On second thought...
7227 : You have terminated your trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild and formed a new one with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7228 : Our system works like this. We will ask you to provide us with a certain item depending on your craft skill rank. There is a set time limit (one day, Earth time) in which you may bring as many of the item as you can synthesize.
7229 : If you happen to create a high quality version of the requested item, we will be more than delighted to accept that as well.
7230 : Trading us these items will earn you guild points which can be later exchanged for other specialty goods--some of which are found exclusively at this guild.
7231 : The amount of guild points you will receive varies with the item requested, and there is a limit to how many points you can accumulate during the designated time frame. Trading items after you have reached the limit will result in no points gained.
7232 : When the time limit has expired, the item requested by the guild will change. It will also change in the event your craft skill rises.
7233 : I see that you have not formed a trading contract with any of the other guilds.
7234 : If you wish, you may form a new contract with us. However, if you wish to trade items with another guild, you must first terminate your existing contract and forfeit all the guild points you have accumulated.
7235 : You have formed a new trading contract with the [Fishermen's/Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7236 : The current requested item is %. You have # guild points accumulated.
7237 : Currently, no items are being requested by the guild. You have # guild points accumulated.
7238 : Is there something you need? I'm just passing through. I would like to use my points. What are the current limits? How does the trade system work?
7239 : You have # more days (Vana'diel time) to provide us with the requested item.
7240 : Today (Vana'diel time) is the final day we will accept the requested item.
7241 : You can still receive up to # guild points by trading us the item before the time limit is up.
7242 : You are not eligible to receive guild points at this time.
7243 : Exchange points for... Nothing. A high-quality crystal. Analysis crystals. % (1500). % (#). % (70000). % (100000). % (150000). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). A key item.

This procedure cannot be undone, so please consider your decision carefully.
7263 : Renounce your rank as a [Carpenter/Blacksmith/Goldsmith/Weaver/Tanner/Boneworker/Alchemist/Culinarian]? No, retain. Yes, renounce.
7264 : You have successfully renounced your status as a [craftsman/artisan/adept] of the [Carpenters'/Blacksmiths'/Goldsmiths'/Weavers'/Tanners'/Boneworkers'/Alchemists'/Culinarians'] Guild.
7265 : Well, well, well... What is a [handsome/charming] adventurer like you doing in the Weavers' Guild? This is a place for sewers and tailors.
7266 : Well, you're free to look around, but just don't put your grimy hands on any of the merchandise.
7267 : Marvelous! Someone with your fashion sense is more than welcome in our guild! I think we'll start you off with crystal synthesis.
7268 : By using the power in those lovely crystals you find all over the place, we can make all kinds of wonderful garments.
7269 : But it's not as easy as you might think, sweetheart. You must form a perfect image in your mind of the final product, or you'll get nothing but a handful of crystal shards.
7270 : However, the more you try, the clearer your mind will become. I'm sure you've heard the saying, practice makes perfect.
7271 : Someday, you may even be the next Goochichi-Vinchichi! If you need any assistance, feel free to ask my colleagues here in the guild.
7272 : Sewing, tailoring, spinning... The road to becoming a master weaver is long. So, why not take time to stop and smell the flowers along the way?
7273 : I can see it now--the day will come when all Vana'diel garments have the % logo on them...
7274 : I think that you are ready to move up in the fashion world. Don't think of this as a test, but I'd like you to make me %.
7275 : If it catches my eye, I'll let you in on some of my trade secrets.
7276 : ... Marvelous! You will now be referred to as [an amateur/a recruit/an initiate/a novice/an apprentice] in our fine establishment! I just love your work!
7277 : Marvelous! Simply marvelous! From this day forth, your new title is journeyman! I just hope you'll have your next work out in time for the winter line!
7278 : Wonderful work! Your designs are beginning to parallel those of the top fashion artists! You are now an official artisan!
7279 : Marvelous... Truly marvelous... Your works are no longer merely simple clothes made to be worn, but works of art where the wearer is merely a display case for your genius! I am proud to call you an adept!
7280 : Well, I'm just speechless! You have become a true veteran! I'm so happy I could just get up and dance!
7281 : Why hello there, [handsome/sister]... What? Not a member? Well, then you'll need to wander over and see Ponono.
7282 : Oh no! I know what you-hoo want, but you'll have to wait to get anything more from me.
7283 : I'm sorry, [handsome/sister], but you look a little bit low on money, honey...
7284 : Well, I won't let you down, [handsome/sister]. Close your eyes and get ready...
7285 : Why don't you try %? It's all the rage this season. You'll need...
7286 : Did you get that, [handsome/sister]? If you ever need anything...a-ny-thing...don't forget to come see Terude-Harude.
7287 : I...I think I'm getting a little dizzy-wizzy... Oooh...
7288 : Hey, Nikkoko can only do so much.
7289 : Sorry, Charlie. There's not enough gil here.
7290 : All righty! Now cross your eyes and dot your T's...
7291 : Hmm... How about %? They're always popular among adventurers. You'll need...
7292 : Got it? When you're done, bring it right on over to Nikkoko. I'd love to see it!
7293 : This guild gets hundreds of orders from royalty all around Vana'diel. I'm just working here part-time to help them keep up with the load.
7294 : Sorry, but my hands are tied...
7295 : Sorry, but you don't have enough gil. With my part-time wages, I can't afford to bend the rules.
7296 : Okay. Close your eyes really tight...
7297 : Why don't you try %? It's this year's latest model. You'll need...
7298 : Oh yeah, and if you have any garments that you don't wear anymore, you can always sell them here. With all these orders, we need all the extra material we can get.
7299 : I'm beginning to see that you are no ordinary adventurer. Maybe it's time that you got serious about weaving. Bring me a handmade %.
7300 : If your designs are as marvelous as people around the city are starting to say, I'll grant you the title of craftsman.
7301 : But you'll have to remember...there is still a lot left to learn. Stick your hands into the cookie jars of too many guilds, and you'll get full!
7302 : If you still wish to pursue your studies in other guilds, I must ask you to part with us here.
7303 : Marvelous! Once again, your work amazes me! You have proved yourself worthy of the title of craftsman!
7304 : Soon you will be ready to refine your skills on more luxurious materials for more luxurious customers...at a more luxurious price.
7305 : % is a wonderful new method of clothcraft that allows you to enchant fabrics with the mysterious energy of black magic and anima.
7306 : % is a wonderful new method of clothcraft that allows you to enchant fabrics with the mysterious energy of white magic and anima.
7307 : Do you remember what I told you back when you were a brand-spanking-new craftsman of our guild?
7308 : Sticking your hands into the cookie jars of too many guilds? Getting full? Ring any bells?
7309 : Well, you must have one terrible memory, because I heard that you went and became a craftsman at another guild! Haven't you noticed that your weaving skills are not improving like they used to?
7310 : It's all because you can't focus on the fabric with all this other junk in your tiny little brain! Now, if you were to give up the craftsman status of all those other guilds...
7311 : Revoke all other craftsman statuses? Let's do it! I'm not one for focusing.
7312 : Wonderful! Now you can clear your mind and start weaving again. Oh, and don't worry about informing the other guildmasters of your decision. Leave that all to me!
7313 : Hrm... I guess that % is just another brand headed for the bargain bin...
7314 : Hm? A special order? Well, get in line, honey. The minimum wait on genuine Ponono is at least six years.
7315 : .........
7316 : I see that your situation is a little more severe than a supper party at the consulate's mansion. However, even if I do help you out, I'm not so sure how much luck you'll have in fooling those sly birdmen.
7317 : And what if you get caught? Officials on both sides will start asking questions, snooping around...and before you know it, the costume will lead them right back to me! I could be ruined!
7318 : ...But on the other hand, if you succeed, it would prove that my designs were even irresistible to the beastmen! Alright, I'll do it! Go out and find % and %, and I'll get started on the pattern design.
7319 : Oh, and I'll need # gil as well for supplies. What? You don't think parchment grows on trees now, do you? What? It does?
7320 : Calm down, calm down. I'm still working on the design. I could be weaving vermillion cloaks, you know. Anyway, come back later, and don't forget the %, the %, and the # gil I asked for.
7321 : What's this? You're not thinking about abandoning this splendid venture, are you?
7322 : You're just in time, my friend. I've completed the design and now I can begin working on the pattern. I'll need a couple of days, but you don't mind waiting a little longer, do you?
7323 : ...... Don't tell me you've...you've...you've lost an original Ponono pattern!? Just think if one were to make its way to the black market! They'd be making fake Pononos left and right! I'd be ruined!
7324 : And I bet you want another one, right? You read my mind. Actually, no. I've had enough of this...
7325 : Well...alright. But only because I like you...and only because you're going to pay me # gil to make you a new one.
7326 : Pay # gil? Of course! You've got to be crazy!
7327 : Okay. I'll forgive you this time, but don't let it happen again! Come back in a few days to pick up the pattern.
7328 : You cannot rush a great artist! Can Goochichi-Vinchichi sew a luxurious handbag in a day? Can Naphille piece together one of her pochettes with a sweaty adventurer breathing down her neck? I think you know the answer. Now shoo!
7329 : The cutting is complete! And quite a masterpiece, I must say.
7330 : And now the rest is up to you. The following is a list of items you will need to put the finishing touches on your headpiece:
7331 : One %, my %, %, %, %, and two %.
7332 : Oh, and don't forget two %. Did you get all that?
7333 : And I hope you've been brushing up on your bonecrafting and leatherworking skills. Hey, I didn't say that this job would be easy.
7334 : But I have one hundred and two-percent faith in you. I know you have what it takes to pull off this project. I would've kicked you out of my guild a long time ago if you didn't!
7335 : And once the headpiece is finished, you'll be the [most handsome/hottest] Yagudo in Vana'diel!
7336 : What? Did you think that I was going to finish the project for you? I'm sorry, %, but as much as I'd love to help you, I cannot put my guild and the people that work here at risk. Do you see poor Anillah over there? She has nine little brothers and sisters to feed!
7337 : But I do understand that you definitely do not have enough skill to pull off this job on your own.
7338 : How about this...
7339 : I'll give you the recipe for the headpiece. You jot that down, and then go out and find one of my star pupils and have her make it for you! You'll need the following things:
7340 : You should have no problem finding a kind adventurer to whip together that hat for you.
7341 : Just make sure she's a weaving adept, and that she has skills in bone and leathercraft.
7342 : Oh, and don't forget to thank her generously for her services. Climbing the weaver ranks is not easy...and definitely not cheap!
7343 : Sorry, but the synthesis items for that rank are still beyond your skill.
7344 : % is a wonderful new method of weaving that allows you to work fiber with a spindle, making it easier to process more thread with one crystal.
7345 : % is a wonderful new method of weaving that allows you to sew feathers with zephyr thread, making it easier to process more fletching with one crystal.
7346 : As [a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master], your garments are the talk of the town. And yet the world of fashion is ever evolving! Are you ready to join the ranks of Vana'diel's legendary clothing designers?
7347 : Move up in the world? I sure will! I'll stay where I am.
7348 : Splendid! You've got a true eye for fashion, hon, and I'd hate to see that go to waste. First, you'll want to speak to Hauh Colphioh and get yourself a copy of %.
7349 : She'll be taking some guild points off your hands, but that's a small price to pay for the chance at seeing your name in boutiques all across Vana'diel, wouldn't you say?
7350 : For shame! And here I thought % was destined to be the latest fashion craze. But hey. If you don't want all the adoring fans, hon, I'll be more than happy to take them.
7351 : First, you'll want to speak to Hauh Colphioh and get yourself a copy of %.
7352 : Read % cover to cover, have you? Then whip out your needle and thread and let's get weaving!
7353 : Your task will be to make me %. First, you'll be needing to round up the necessary materials. To wit...
7354 : And whatever you do, don't forget to stitch your logo into your work. You don't need me to tell you that in the world of fashion, brand recognition is everything!
7355 : Aren't you the forgetful one? But don't sweat it, sweetheart, we all have our days. To make %, you'll be needing...
7356 : Marvelous! Simply marvelous! I knew % was destined to be the next hot name in the fashion world. From this day forward, I call you an expert!
7357 : Did you pick this up off the bargain bin? No? Well, how do you expect me to know that if you don't sign your work!?
7358 : If you want your customers to remember the name %, you'll have to put it where they can see it. Hope you've got enough thread for another go-round, 'cause your work isn't done yet.
7359 : I'm beginning to see that you are no ordinary adventurer. Maybe it's time that you got serious about weaving. Bring me a handmade %.
7360 : If your designs are as marvelous as people around the city are starting to say, I'll grant you the title of [artisan/adept/veteran].
7361 : But you'll have to remember...there is still a lot left to learn. Stick your hands into the cookie jars of too many guilds, and you'll get full!
7362 : If you still wish to pursue your studies in other guilds, I must ask you to part with us here.
7363 : But you'll have to remember...there is still a lot left to learn. Stick your hands into the cookie jars of too many guilds, and you'll get full! Focus on the fabric, and you'll have nothing to fear.
7364 : Do you remember what I told you back when you were a brand-spanking-new [artisan/adept/veteran] of our guild? Sticking your hands into the cookie jars of too many guilds? Getting full? Ring any bells?
7365 : Well, you must have one terrible memory, because you've gone and done just that! Haven't you noticed that your weaving skills aren't improving like they used to?
7366 : It's all because you can't focus on the fabric with all this other junk in your tiny little brain! Now, if you were to give up your [artisan/adept/veteran] status at those other guilds...
7367 : Why, you could clear your mind and start weaving again! You needn't even worry about informing the other guildmasters of your decision. Leave that all to me! What do you say?
7368 : And here I thought we had the next big look.
7369 : Looks like % is just another brand headed for the bargain bin...
7370 : Well, it looks like we have a visitorrr! C'mon, everybody! Let's give our adventurer a warrrm Boneworkers' Guild welcome!
7371 : Well, that wasn't very nice! After we gave you a warrrm welcome and everything! If you don't want to have any fun with us, well, then, you'd better just go home!
7372 : Did you hear that, everybody? We've got a super new memberrr! Let's hearrr it for %!
7373 : That crrrystal is for you. You're going to need it if you want to make anything while you're on your adventurrres.
7374 : When you have all your materials rrready, hold on to that crrrystal reaaally tight and form an image in your head of what you want to make.
7375 : And if you concentrate realllly hard... Poof! Instant item! Isn't that just the most amazing thing you've ever hearrrd?
7376 : When you're just starrrting off, it doesn't always work out that well...but I know you'll get the hang of it! And feel free to ask any of the other workers for advice! They're all superrr-troopers!
7377 : Gimme a 'B'! Gimme an 'O'! Gimme an 'N'! Gimme an 'E'! What does that spell? YEAH!!! But not just bones--horns, fangs, teeth, scales, shells--we use all those grrreat materials!
7378 : Thanks to your super work, more and more adventurerrrs have joined our guild! Let's hearrr it for %!
7379 : Are you rrready for the next level, %? Well then, let's see you make %!
7380 : I know you can do it! I know you can do it!
7381 : ... Wow! Super job! Hey, everrrybody, % is our newest [amateur/recruit/initiate/novice/apprentice]! Let's hearrr it for %!
7382 : ... Super-duper job! Listen up, everrrybody! Our friend, %, is now a journeyman! Let's hearrr it for %!
7383 : ... Come here, everrrybody. Take a look at this... Is this not the most excellent crrraftsmanship that you've ever seen? Super job, %! You're now our newest artisan!
7384 : ... Amazing job! Everrrybody, can you feel the energy in this room? Can you? That's our new adept, %! Let's have one last cheer for %!
7385 : ... All rrright! Everybody, listen up! We've got a new veteran! If you have any questions about bonework, you know who to ask!
7386 : Darrrling, can't you see I'm in the middle of something rrreally, rrreally important?
7387 : I appreciate the gesture, love, but shouldn't you be getting to worrrk?
7388 : Ah ha ha ha! Darrrling, darrrling... Do I look like I work for charrrity? Now, go ask your mummy for some spare change and we'll get to work.
7389 : Coming to me was an excellent choice, darrrling. Now close your lovely eyes...
7390 : For you, love? How about %? You'll need...
7391 : If you ever need any more assistance, darrrling, I'm sure you can find your way back to Lih Pituu.
7392 : Dem bones, dem bones, dem wight bones... Don't you just love the way dem bones shiney-shine when you wash them?
7393 : Didn't somebody just help you...?
7394 : I'm sorry to say, but I'm going to need a few more clams than that.
7395 : Okay! Blink your eyes three times...
7396 : Why don't you try %? I can always help you if you want!
7397 : ...is all you'll need! I can feel it in my bones... You're going to be a great boneworker!
7398 : Please, [sir/ma'am], I don't know much. Talk to the guildmasterrr, Peshi Yohnts.
7399 : I'm sorrrry, [sir/ma'am], but there is nothing more I can do for you.
7400 : As much as I would like to help you for free, [sir/ma'am], I must follow the rules...
7401 : I'll do my best, [sir/ma'am], but I cannot guarantee anything... Please don't get upset...
7402 : You probably can make one already, but how about %? You will need...
7403 : Take care when working with bones... They often break when least expected...
7404 : Look, everrrybody, % is back! Isn't that exciting? And it looks like you're rrready to tackle %!
7405 : Bring one to me and I'll make you a craftsman!
7406 : Now, I know you're all rrrevved up about this project, but I have to let you know--become a craftsman and you'll be one of us.
7407 : You can always become a craftsman in another guild, but your ability may fade. We wouldn't want that now, would we? Anyway, do your best!
7408 : ... Super-cool! Everrrybody, listen up! % is now an official craftsman! Let's hearrr it for %!
7409 : <Psst> And by the way, you can always go and become a craftsman in another guild, but don't forrrget the consequences...
7410 : % is a wonderful new method of boneworking that allows you to enchant bones and shells with the mysterious energy of black magic and anima.
7411 : % is a wonderful new method of boneworking that allows you to enchant bones and shells with the mysterious energy of white magic and anima.
7412 : Hey everrrybody! It's the super-traitor, %! Did you know that [he's/she's] gone and become a crrraftsman at another guild!?
7413 : I bet that you'rrre now wondering why your boneworking skills won't go up any more, aren't you?
7414 : Well, it's like I told you before, if you don't concentrate on one trade, your skills will start to fade. Hey, I just rhymed! Isn't that great!? Anyway, all you have to do to get your boneworking motors running again is give up your craftsman status at all other guilds!
7415 : Revoke all other craftsman statuses? I'm ready! Wait!
7416 : Alright! %'s back with the boneworkers! Here, let me call the other guildmasters and tell them the good news!
7417 : Ehhh? Where's your boneworking spirit? Don't you want to be the best of the best? Come on, %! You know what you really want!
7418 : Hey everybody, it's %! Why, just seeing your smile has lit up all our days! What brrrings you by today?
7419 : .........
7420 : A disguise? It sounds mysterious! It sounds intrrriguing! It sounds...super-dilly-ocious! I'll do it!
7421 : Now tell me...what's a Quaddle again?
7422 : .........
7423 : A turtle? Well, why didn't you say so!? I know exactly what you need! I'll work on a rrrough plan while you go out and find % and %.
7424 : And my fee? I couldn't think of taking money from my closest, [handsomest/cutest], most bestest frrriend, %! (Even though the guild is in debt for 98,000,000 gil...)
7425 : Pay 98,000,000 gil? Why not? I'm loaded! Not in 98 million years.
7426 : Okay, okay. I don't want to put you in debt or anything. How about # gil? That shouldn't set you back too much, should it? Alrrright! Now let's get to it!
7427 : Hey everrrybody! %'s here...again! As much as I'd love to hand over the plans to your turtle disguise, I'm going to need just a little more time! Oh, and don't forget the %, the %, and the # gil I asked forrr!
7428 : Or...are you trrrying to tell me you'd rrrather give up and not spend all that time and gil?
7429 : If you choose to give up, the quest will be canceled and your quest log reset.
7430 : Cancel the quest? Yes. No.
7431 : Do you really wish to cancel the quest? I really do. I guess I don't.
7432 : The quest has been canceled!
7433 : Great job, %! You're one superrr trooperrr! Now I can finally get started on the parts. It'll be another couple days, but that's alrrright, isn't it?
7434 : Hey, hey, hey! What's with the long face? Why are you feeling so blue? What has got you down in the dumps?
7435 : Need another set of barbut parts? Yes. No. You know what, I give up...
7436 : Is that all? Well, you came to the rrright place, %! I'll have another set of parts all rrready for you...
7437 : ...for the low, low price of # gil! I'll even give you a thrrree-year guarantee! What do you say!? Do we have a deal!?
7438 : Pay the # gil? Yes. No way!
7439 : Grrreat! Hey everybody, listen up! Now we can afford that icebox for our pamama au lait! Oh, %, were you still there? Come back in a couple days for your parts...and an icy-cold drrrink!
7440 : Hey everrrybody! %'s here...again... (I thought I told you that it would take a couple of days. Now get the hell out of my face!) Alrrright! We'll see you later! Have a great day!
7441 : Yeah! You can turn that frrrown upside down! The parts for your disguise are rrready to go!
7442 : Now, all that's left is piecing the puzzle together! I'll give you the list of ingredients you'll need, so go grrrab a quill and parchment! Are you rrready? Here we go...! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!
7443 : One! %! Two! %! Three! %! Four! %! Five! %! Six! %!
7444 : Seven! %! Eight! Another %! Use %, and mix 'em all arrround. That's what it's all about!
7445 : You've got the boneworking skills. I know you can do it! (Just don't forget to polish your clothcrrraft and leatherworking skills...)
7446 : Hey everrrybody, can we get three cheers for our favorite [guy/lady]? Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip...wait, that'd be four cheers...
7447 : Now all you have to do is piece them together! You didn't think I'd do all the work, did you? I don't even know what one of those Quaduffs looks like!
7448 : Hm... But by the looks of it, you might not exactly have what it takes to put that disguise togetherrr...
7449 : I've got it! Hey everrrybody, listen up. I have a super-duper idea!
7450 : There are a lot of my energetic students out there that would be morrre than happy to whip together that costume of yours. Why don't you go out and find one of them!
7451 : Here, let me fill you in on what he'll need! Are you rrready? Here we go...! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!
7452 : All of my pupils are grrreat, but this project is a doozy! Make sure the superrr trooperrr you find is at least an adept.
7453 : Also make sure that he has dabbled in a little weaving and leathercrrrafting as well!
7454 : Oh, and when he's done with your costume, make sure that you tell him good job, and give him a big hug. (And maybe fork over a few gil for his trouble.) See you around, %! And have a wonderful day! Yeah!
7455 : The synthesis items for that rank are still beyond your skill, I'm afraid.
7456 : % is a wonderful new method of boneworking that allows you to work bone with a shagreen file, making it easier to process more arrowheads with one crystal.
7457 : Well, if it isn't [a veteran/an expert/an authority/a luminary/a master] of our rrranks. Let me guess: you're looking to smash through the barrier and take your bonecrafting skills to the next level. Am I right?
7458 : Am I right? You betcha! Not exactly.
7459 : Now, that's a rrright answer if I ever heard one. Here's what you can do: first, trrrack down Samigo-Pormigo and get yourself a copy of %.
7460 : You'll be needing some guild points for the transaction. Just consider it a warrrm-up for the greater task at hand.
7461 : Then what're you wasting my time for? Be on your way, and don't rrreturn until you're ready to show some commitment to our craft.
7462 : First, you'll want to trrrack down Samigo-Pormigo and get yourself a copy of %.
7463 : Now here's a [man/woman] who's read % from cover to cover. I'm right, arrren't I?
7464 : No need for further delays then. Whip me up %, and let's make it spiffy. The materials you'll need are...
7465 : And not like you need a rrreminder, but be sure to sign your work. Otherwise, how will we know it's you who made it, and not some clever impostor?
7466 : You forgot the ingrrredients for % already? Seems like someone needs to work on [his/her] memory as much as [his/her] bonecrafting skills. You'll be needing...
7467 : Terrrific work, %! If there was anyone worrrthy of the title of expert rank, it's you! With you in our ranks, our wares are sure to fetch a fortune!
7468 : This is unacceptable, [Mister/Miss]...oh, what was your name again? I seem to have forgotten, just as you've forgotten to sign your work!
7469 : As you rise through the ranks, it's even more crucial that you show proper respect for guild prrrotocol. Now get back out there, and do try to follow instrrructions this time.
7470 : Look, everrrybody, % is back! Isn't that exciting? And it looks like you're rrready to tackle %!
7471 : Bring one to me and I'll make you [an artisan/an adept/a veteran]!
7472 : Now, I know you're all rrrevved up about this project, but I have to let you know--become [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] and you'll be one of us.
7473 : You can always become [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in another guild, but your ability may fade. We wouldn't want that now, would we? Anyway, do your best!
7474 : Oh, and if you're looking to achieve [arrrtisan/adept/veterrran] status in another guild, keep in mind that doing so will take its toll on your bonecrafting prrrowess.
7475 : Hold it rrright there, %! What's this about you becoming [an artisan/an adept/a veteran] in another guild?
7476 : At this rate, you'll never rrreach your true potential as a boneworker. Talk about a downer!
7477 : But here's the brrright side! It isn't too late to revoke your [artisan/adept/veteran] rank with those other guys and come back to the fold.
7478 : What's more, you don't even have to worry about facing any scary guildmasterrrs. Just gimme the good word and I'll take care of everything! So, what'll it be?
7479 : Boo! Boo on you, %! And here I thought you were something special when you made [arrrtisan/adept/veterrran]!
7480 : One, two, three, four--out the door! I've got real boneworkers who deserrrve my attention more than some dabbling dilettante.
7481 : I have been burdened with the duty of breaking the following news to all our faithful adventurers, kupo...
7482 : After lengthy deliberation, the Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has decided upon the cancellation of the Feast of Swords, kupo...
7483 : A series of scandals within MHMU's upper management in recent years has led to the-- Kupopo!?
7484 : The moogle appears to have received a message...!
7485 : G-grave news, kupo!!! Unknown individuals donning priceless samurai armor from the Far East have been wreaking havoc!!!
7486 : Furthermore, these shady individuals claim the armor was borrowed by the MHMU, kupo!
7487 : Please lend us a hand, brave adventurer! Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it, kupo!
7488 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
7489 : This new weapon, the %, was developed as a countermeasure for serious situations such as this, kupo. It has been designed with the ability to absorb malicious auras emitted by enemies.
7490 : We want you to use it to absorb malice from those wacky samurai wannabes, and then plant this % near where they fall. By doing so, you can further weaken the insidious individuals inside the armor, kupo!
7491 : To plant the %, all you have to do is trade it to the ground near a fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo!
7492 : When you plant the % into the ground, all malice absorbed inside will be purified by the land, kupo!
7493 : Alright then! Take this % and get to work on those vile villains! I'll be preparing your special reward, kupo!
7494 : Equip this %, and have a nomad moogle outside town cast special moogle magic upon it. Be sure to absorb as much malice as you can from those scoundrels, kupo!
7495 : Good job, kupo! You sure showed them who's boss! Thanks to you, we were able to avoid a diplomatic disaster with the Far East, kupo.
7496 : A handful of no-good nomad moogles and Goblins were conspiring to take over the MHMU, wilfully assuming false identities in order to obtain the armor and frame us, kupo!
7497 : Then, they hired thieves to wear the armor and do their dirty work!
7498 : But thanks to all you courageous adventurers, the MHMU is safe and sound, kupo!
7499 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, kupo!
7500 : You have % equipped! Great! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7501 : After you've taken care of the armor wearer, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7502 : The malice absorption magic will lose effect if you move to another area, so come back here if you want me to cast it again, kupo.
7503 : You have % equipped! I like your enthusiasm! Now, hold still while I cast miraculously marvelous moogle magic on it, kupo.
7504 : After you've seen to the wretched rogue inside the armor, plant your % into the ground near the fallen fiend. You'll get a reward that matches the amount of malice absorbed, kupo.
7505 : We need your help to clear the land of the malice-emitting menace, but you need to equip the % you have in your possession, kupo!
7506 : Nooo, that % won't do. Come back again after you have % equipped, kupo!
7507 : Kupopo! There's no malice here at all. Please absorb lots more and try again, kupo.
7508 : Kupopo! You've absorbed [a bit of/some/lots of] malice, kupo. Here's your reward!
7509 : Thanks, kupo. We want you to absorb even more malice, and weaken those armored evildoers, kupo!
7510 : You can purify absorbed malice by planting your % here.
7511 : A mysterious power absorbs the malice!
7512 : Please select absorption value. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
7531 : Yowl! You've got guts to come to me auction house! I'm the one who's in charrrge 'ere! If you 'ave any trouble 'ere, come see me!
7532 : Anyone who tries to cheat 'ere will be hung, strung, and quartered! That'll learrrn 'em!
7533 : Those wanting goods delivered to their Mog House or to their friend's Mog House, speak to me. Those who want to parrrticipate in an auction, please go to the auction counters on my right.
7534 : If express delivery is what you want, you've come to the right place, all rrright! The super-sonic An and An sisterrrs will have it there fasterrr than light!
7535 : My name is An Polaali. I've parrrtnered up here with An Shanaa 'cause we are the best.
7536 : I'm An Shanaa. An Polaali there's my greatest rrrival and closest friend.
7537 : Day in and day out, it's the same old rrroutine. So she and I decided to have a contest over who can deliver things the fastest!
7538 : Ladies and gentlepeople, horrible and honorable! The Troupe Valeriano is proud to perform in a place as powerful and pleasantly peopled as this!
7539 : Welcome to the Troupe Valeriano. Valeriano, at your service! Have a laugh, then spend some cash! Treats and sweets from exotic lands!
7540 : ......
7541 : Surprising that an advanced country like Bastok could fall behind in conquests... That Hume technology can't do everything, I guess.
7542 : I'm not too fond of the folksy-wolksy in these parts. All important with their noses in the air and their tails a-waving, but cheap as can be. You folk from other countries need to get cracking!
7543 : Them Elvaan sure are strong with their pointy ears and pointy swords! San d'Oria's sure to be in the lead for a long while yet!
7544 : The food around here's purrretty good, especially with all the exotic ingrrredients available these days.  My fellow Windurstians, you had better go on morrre conquests or you'll be left behind!
7545 : Interrrested in a knife trick? It's a special routine I worrrked out. But keep your distance, if you value your ears and moustaches as they are!
7546 : I believe...it is the blood of knights...running in Elvaan veins...that gives them victory...
7547 : ...What...think you?
7548 : Ladies and gentlefolk, welcome to the Troupe Valeriano show! We are enthused to be able to perform in a city of such wealth and fame as Bastok!
7549 : Welcome to the Troupe Valeriano. Valeriano, at your service! Have a laugh, then spend some cash! Treats and sweets from exotic lands!
7550 : Bastok is a much nicer place now than when I left it. You guys must've worked real hard! If only I could go back to bashing monster heads again with you guys.
7551 : Isn't this place great? Bastok's my hometown, you know! Well, there might be a few problems, but it's still the best city in the world!
7552 : There's a store that sells really good instruments here! I'm gonna-wanna sneak off there later. Ah! Shh, don't tell my boss...
7553 : There's plenty of bards around, but I'm the best flute player in Vana'diel. You don't believe me? Stay awhile and listen.
7554 : The food here's terrrible! C'mon, Windurstians, worrrk harder! I miss Windurstian cuisine.
7555 : Like to see my new knife trrrick? Oh, but keep your distance, if you value your ears and moustaches as they are!
7556 : This place...is tiring...
7557 : ... (I'm a mime.)
7558 : Halfling philosophers and heroine beauties, welcome to the Troupe Valeriano show! And how gorgeous and green this fair town is!
7559 : Welcome to the Troupe Valeriano. Valeriano, at your service! Have a laugh, then spend some cash! Treats and sweets from exotic lands!
7560 : Surprising that Bastok, with its mighty Galkan warriors, could end up playing second fiddle to such a happy-go-lucky country as this. I'm looking forward to seeing you guys take the lead again.
7561 : Watch it! Keep back from the flames! These ain't magical illusions, you know! Real flames burn people!
7562 : Oh, I left you behind Only to return to you, oh Windurst! So rich, your glory sends me blind, Lo, praise the Star Sibyl, oh Windurst!
7563 : Windurst is the besty! You can forget about the resty! The air, so fair, has a different smell! It improves my tone, can't you tell?
7564 : It's so verrrdant here and the food is delicious. I can hardly breathe in those other countries. Keep up the good work so I can stay here longerrr!
7565 : Want to see my new knife trrrick? But keep your distance, if you value your ears and moustaches as they arrre!
7566 : There are...so many...bugs here... This country...is...frightening...
7567 : ...Please...enjoy...
7568 : Can't you see I'm busy now? Give a girl a little brrreathing room, huh?
7569 : Heh-heh-heh... I wouldn't wander around this area unless you have good reason to... It could be dangerrrous!
7570 : Haven't you ever heard the name of Nanaa Mihgo? Well, this is herrr house!
7571 : We only take orders from the top cat. When she says, Jump!, we say, How high?...and we always land on our feet, of course.
7572 : Grrr... You don't seem to understand how harrrd being a member of her gang is, do you?
7573 : Humph... Looks like that Nanaa Mihgo, better known as the Cat Burglar, is at her home forrr once.
7574 : An adventurer such as yourself ought to be careful, lest you get burrrned.
7575 : So, who do you think you arrre? You want to crrrawl up to me, do you?
7576 : Well, if you bring me a little something as a sign of your desire to be my frrriend, I might just considerrr the possibility...
7577 : Haven't I seen you somewhere beforrre? Weren't you the one running with those pack of brrrats from the port area?
7578 : So you've come to apologize, have you? Well, you had better bring me a little something to show your desire to be my frrriend! Then I'll consider whether to forrrgive you or not...
7579 : Well, if you want to be all chummy with me, you had better bring me a token offerrring firrrst. I'll be waiting... Hah!
7580 : What's that? You're contemplating taking something to Nanaa Mihgo?
7581 : I recommend you forrrget that! She'll take you in, all right, but not the way you expect! Haven't you heard that she's involved with some nasty foreign mob? Be carrreful!
7582 : What? You want to make frrriends with Nanaa Mihgo? Well, you've got no chance of that right now, have you?
7583 : If you want to run with the top cat, you'll have to be the right kind of rogue firrrst!
7584 : We crrrawled up to the top cat by taking her four % each. That's how she accepted us! You think you can match that?
7585 : You can get your paws on % by defeating those Yagudo beastmen. But you won't please the Tarutaru very much if you go arrround fighting Yagudo!
7586 : Windurst is currently trying to maintain amicable relations with the Yagudo. It's a very different worrrld from what it was twenty years ago...
7587 : Trying to win Nanaa Mihgo over is a waste of time! The most she will do is rrreturn your kindness with hostility.
7588 : Looking at her, I rrrealize it's not a person's birth, but their upbringing, that determines who they become.
7589 : Purrr... For you to bring me these implies my two followers out in front let the cat out of the bag.
7590 : Well, anyway, I'll accept these as a token of your esteem. And if you happen by any more of these, then give them to me, and I'll make it worrrth your while. Farewell now.
7591 : Just 'cause I accepted your token of esteem doesn't mean you can get away with murderrr!
7592 : You have to do things my way if you don't want me getting all catty on you! Now, goodbye and ta-ta!
7593 : % are illegal contraband, so they naturally fetch a high price through the properrr channels.
7594 : So curious little catspaws like you are more than welcome! With your help, we'll make a killing!
7595 : Humph! You just did as I said and gave the top cat some %, didn't you?
7596 : Well, that's just being a copycat! Don't think you're any better than us, or else fur will fly!
7597 : Purrr... For you to bring me these implies my two followers out in front let the cat out of the bag.
7598 : Well, anyway, apology accepted. Just be more careful next time! And if you happen by any more of these, then hand them to me, and I'll make it worrrth your while. Farewell now.
7599 : Judging by its feel, I'd swear this is a prrrecious stone of some type, but I seem to be losing my instinct on this one...
7600 : Grrr... Who do you think you are? You shouldn't go sneaking around people's homes...you might be mistaken as a burglar!
7601 : But I'll let you off this time...that is, if you can tell me what this stone is!
7602 : As farrr as I can tell, it looks just like a plain rock, but it may be some kind of ore or something. I wonderrr...
7603 : Hey, that's it...! I have a little job for you! Carrre to go to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok and ask them what in Vana'diel this is?
7604 : Agree to help? Accept. Decline.
7605 : Neverrr mind. I'll just throw this at...I mean, to...the kids who follow me around.
7606 : If it isn't worth much, then go ahead and sell it to the Goldsmiths' Guild. Just make sure you bring the prrroceeds back to me, okay?
7607 : Head over to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok and ask them what that stone is.
7608 : If it isn't worrrth much, then sell it to the Goldsmiths' Guild. Just be sure you bring the proceeds from the sale back to me, okay?
7609 : So, did you make it to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Bastok? Good for you! And how much did you get for that lump of rrrock?
7610 : Oh...You didn't sell it? Well, go back to Bastok and sell it, then. Now, get going!
7611 : Well, if we've only learned one thing, it's this--it's farrr better to set our sights on the travelers in the port area.
7612 : The travelers in Windurst Woods are all merchants who keep their guard up, or the occasional idiot who carries around a strange rock as if it's a precious jewel. Not worth the efforrrt, is it?
7613 : Seems the top cat herrrself can make mistakes sometimes. Picking pebbles from the pockets of passers-by... My ass-onance! She's got me talking-walking like a Tarutaru now!
7614 : Oops...! Keep what I said just now a secret, okay? Parrrticularly keep it from the top cat!
7615 : Ah! Don't tell me you sold off my rock for that dismal sum!
7616 : Grrr... If you hadn't sold it off, we could have received a bigger reward from that silly traveler for finding it... Oh well... It's no longer worth my bother.
7617 : Ahhh... I traveled all the way here from Bastok, but I lost the stone that was the purpose of my journey.
7618 : Hm? What kind of stone did I lose?
7619 : It was a rock that we found in the Palborough Mines, north of Bastok. It had small traces of mythril in it.
7620 : But that's not all... Besides the mythril, there's some unknown magic source in it.
7621 : If you mention magic, then you think of Windurst, right? I was hoping to get the Rhinostery to check it out, so I came all the way here.
7622 : But now that I've lost the rock in question, I'm stumped. After all the dangers I went through to get my hands on that rock, too... Boy, am I at my wits' end!
7623 : I spread the word that I'd pay a reward to the one who finds my %, but didn't get a single response.
7624 : Guess I'll have to go back to the depths of the Palborough Mines and dig up another one...but that place is so dangerous, and...how can I show my face in Bastok!?
7625 : Oh...! Ooohhhww...! Just when I had given up hope, too! Thank you! Thank you ever so much!
7626 : How can I ever repay you? Words cannot express my gratitude, so here, please accept this...
7627 : Now I can show my face in Bastok again! Words will never express my gratitude... Just...thank you!
7628 : Thanks for your help the other day! I took that stone and left it with the Rhinostery.
7629 : Guess I'll just do some sightseeing until the results come back. Then again...I've already seen every nook and cranny of this place while I was searching frantically for the stone I lost!
7630 : This is the eastern gatehouse--a gathering place for the guards who do the rrrounds of Windurst Woods.
7631 : If you're after a map of Windurst, then head to the opening back up there. There's a Mithra merchant selling them there.
7632 : How arrre you? I'm fine, as always...I think.
7633 : We've been having a spot of trouble because of those Yagudo beastmen, but Captain Rakoh Buuma's on hand, so things are underrr control...I think.
7634 : Arrre you going to fight the good fight along with us? That'd be grrreat...I think. Speak to Captain Rakoh Buuma and she'll set you right!
7635 : Hey, you seem to be from another country...I think. If you'rrre looking for the Consulate of [San d'Oria/Bastok], then it's [in this area/west of here]...[across the Bomingo Round/in Port Windurst].
7636 : What are you staring at? Haven't you ever seen a Mithra beforrre?
7637 : Here in Windurst Woods, there arrre many Mithra. You'll soon get over it...
7638 : This is Windurst Woods, the Mithra part of town! We Mithra have to stick together, so feel welcome, frrriend!
7639 : I, I, erm, am one of the guards here. <gulp>... Well, erm, nice to meety-weety you!
7640 : I, I'm still getting used to it, erm, here... But I'm trying-wrying my besty!
7641 : ERROR: SAYING A MASKED ANSWER!
7642 : You cannot accept more than one mission at a time.
7643 : Please complete your current mission before applying for the next.
7644 : The missions we are currently able to offer you at the eastern gatehouse are as follows...
7645 : Which mission will you accept? The Horutoto Ruins Experiment. The Heart of the Matter. The Price of Peace. Lost for Words. A Testing Time. The Three Kingdoms. Mission 2-3-1A. Mission 2-3-1B. Mission 2-3-2A. Mission 2-3-2B. To Each His Own Right. Written in the Stars. A New Journey. Magicite. The Final Seal. The Shadow Awaits. Full Moon Fountain. Saintly Invitation. The Sixth Ministry. Awakening of the Gods. Vain. The Jester Who'd Be King. Doll of the Dead. Moon Reading. Dummy11. Dummy12. Dummy13. Dummy14. Dummy15. Dummy16. Dummy17. Decline mission.
7646 : The, the Hume guys all say they envy-wenvy me, you know, being surrounded by Mithra ladies all day and everything... B-but, to tell you the truth, I get really tired-wired, day in and day out.
7647 : Rrreally, now!? Of course, you can leave the rrreal monster-slaying work to Buuma's Boomers!
7648 : I'd prefer to give you the work we find the most trying, such as the more delicate missions. Then again, any task involving Tarutaru is delicate in our opinion...
7649 : This is the easterrrn gatehouse. Feel free to ask Captain Rakoh Buuma whenever you need a helping paw from Buuma's Boomerrrs! She's the grrreatest!
7650 : The, the Mithra ladies are normally very p-pleasant and ch-cheery, but you've got to keep on your toesy-woesies!
7651 : Once, I, erm, nodded off for a bit, and, and, woke up to find bite marks on my leggy-leg-legs! I, I, erm, don't want to be eatened!!!
7652 : That Meeri-Wohri is a clumsy little nerrrvous wreck, y'know?
7653 : One day, I awoke from a cat nap wherrre I was having this dream about eating a Mithkabob, only to find I was chewing on the little guy's leg! I hope I didn't hurrrt him...too much.
7654 : This is the eastern gatehouse--a gathering place for the guards who do the rrrounds of Windurst Woods.
7655 : To expel those who would subvert the law and order of Windurst Woods... To protect the Mithra populace from all manner of threats and dangers... That is the job of us guards.
7656 : But lately, ferocious monsters are on the increase, and the beastmen are rrruining nature as they please, so our job is becoming all the more hectic.
7657 : If you are a citizen of Windurst, then perhaps you may lend us a helping hand from time to time in order to protect the peace of our fair town.
7658 : For instance, you could try to do some missions...special tasks issued on behalf of the Federation of Windurst...
7659 : But first, you might prefer to listen to our explanation of the rrrole of gatehouses before you decide...
7660 : Hear explanation of gatehouses? Hear! Hear! Turn a deaf ear.
7661 : Good, then allow us to explain. Sola Jaab, would you like to do the honors?
7662 : Roger, Captain Buuma! It would indeed be an honorrr...
7663 : Well, put simply, the gatehouses are where we guards worrrk and rest.
7664 : We also administer missions herrre--assignments for and on behalf of our country.
7665 : Missions differ from plain quests in that they are rendered as service to your country, so the government will award you rank points forrr each mission you accomplish.
7666 : Register enough points and your rank, or standing in society, will incrrrease.
7667 : So how about it? If you consider yourself a model citizen of Windurst, I rrrecommend you serve your country by trying your hand at missions.
7668 : The very rrreason that you came to Windurst in the first place was because you wanted to make something out of yourself, wasn't it?
7669 : Receive a mission? Accept. Decline.
7670 : Well, I guess there's little more to say than Maybe next time, eh?
7671 : So you don't need to know about gatehouses, eh? I don't suppose you'll be interested in taking on any missions, then...?
7672 : Well said! That heartfelt rrreply is your first great step towards making Windurst a better place.
7673 : So, without further delay, let's issue you your first mission. Do either of you have just the rrright mission for [him/her]?
7674 : Said like a real woman! That heartfelt reply is your first great step towards making Windurst a better place.
7675 : So, without further delay, let's issue you with your first mission. Do either of you have just the rrright mission for our sister here?
7676 : Ex...excusey me... But, I, erm, I know of a mission-wission...
7677 : You see...well...erm... The Orastery in the port area is kinda looking for someone to help them with a magic experiment to be conducted at the Horutoto Ruins.
7678 : I know it's a little sudden-wudden, but they said they were in a fix because they couldn't find anyone to help them. So, erm, how about it then...?
7679 : Good. Carry out that mission! The Orastery is the ministry that rrruns a Mage Academy to improve the military's magic abilities.
7680 : To get to the Orastery, you have to go to the port area by heading back west from this gate. Your country is counting on you!
7681 : I, erm, I have a friend who serves at the Orastery. H-he's so cool! Gee... I wish I could be m-more like him!
7682 : O-only the e-elite students from the School of Magic can go on to enter the Orastery. So, so the Tarutaru in the Orastery are the most brilliant magic users in the whole of Windurst!
7683 : The Horutoto Ruins are a bunch of old towerrrs out in Sarutabaruta.
7684 : But they're all falling to pieces now... It was the Tarutaru who destrrroyed them. They insist it was all due to the Great Warrr, but that just sounds like halfling half-truths to me.
7685 : You'rrre not s'posed to go straight to them magical towers, y'know? You'rrre s'posed to go to the Orastery first...I think.
7686 : The Orastery is in charge of the Mage Academy, y'know? That's where the Tarutaru practice their spells all day in order to perrrfect them. It's the big building in the port area...I think.
7687 : The details of the mission will be explained when you meet with the Orastery's minister. I can't say he's the most pleasant of people, but at least he has guts.
7688 : Do us proud!
7689 : Good job! Glad to see you made it back alive! I trust the mission wasn't too dangerous.
7690 : Allocating rrrank points according to your efforts...has enabled you to go up to rrrank two! Congratulations!
7691 : Did you enjoy your little run-in with the ministerrr of the Orastery? Grrr... Oh, and were you able to meet his little sisterrr?
7692 : The Minister of the Orastery's sisterrr is named Apururu. You'd know if you met herrr. She's also the ministerrr of the Manustery.
7693 : Missions are all verrry well and good, but you should also try some quests too...I think!
7694 : Speaking to the townsfolk and trrrying to help them with their problems... It can be very beneficial, y'know!
7695 : You've come just at the rrright time. The Manustery just up the rrroad there is asking for help in making automaton guards at the Cardian workshop.
7696 : Seeing as the Cardian workshop is rrright next door, you can hardly turn this mission down, can you?
7697 : Accept this mission? Accept. Decline.
7698 : Ask the staff at the Cardian workshop for the details.
7699 : The Manustery's Cardian workshop is straight back down that rrroad there, on the right-hand side of the Bomingo Round.
7700 : Rrreally? Too bad, then.
7701 : C-Cardians were invented to fight as magical puppet-like s-soldiers in the Great War of twenty-wenty years ago.
7702 : Th-thanks to the creation of the Cardians, Tarutaru and Mithra guards have come to suffer less injuries.
7703 : Compared to us, Carrrdians are useless. They have no sense when it comes to fighting.
7704 : However, I'll say this about them...they have no fearrr of death. Even we Mithra aren't as darrring as they are. That could be a powerrrful advantage...
7705 : Go right down that road therrre, and when you come out into the round, you'll see a larrrge building up on your right...I think. Well, that's the Manustery's Cardian workshop, y'know?
7706 : To find the entrances to the building, you may have to walk around the place a bit. But it's not enough to get you lost or anything...well, at least that's what I think.
7707 : I'm sure the Minister of the Manustery will fill you in on the details of your mission.
7708 : Cardians come in useful when you're after quantity over quality. Anyway, carry out your mission well--at least it'll help us keep the peace with our neighborhood ministry!
7709 : Hello-ello! And you are... Oh, the volunteer to help us out with my Manustery's little mission, rightaru?
7710 : Very nice of you to have come. My name is Apururu. I'm the Minister of the Manustery, and head of this Cardian workshop.
7711 : But first, I should give you a rundown of what the Manustery is all about, I s'pose.
7712 : The Manustery is the ministry in charge of the production of automaton guards, otherwise known as Cardians. As far as military might goes, our Cardians are second only to the Orastery's War Warlocks.
7713 : Have you ever tried speaking to those doll-like beings that answer back in the words of the stars? Well, they are our Cardians!
7714 : We cast a special kind of magic on a doll made of straw, cloth, and other stuff--that's what gives life to a Cardian.
7715 : We ask traveling merchants or adventurers to provide us with most of the materials we need to make Cardians. But there is one essential material we can't just ask anyone to provide us with...
7716 : That's the heart of the Cardian--a Mana Orb. Without a fully-charged Mana Orb, we cannot cast our special magic on the Cardian to keep them animated.
7717 : That's why we leave the job of energizing Mana Orbs with magic to adventurers from Windurst only. These spheres are very important, so they cannot be entrusted to people-weople from other lands.
7718 : Here...take these six dark Mana Orbs that have lost their glow.
7719 : You are to go to the southeastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins in East Sarutabaruta.
7720 : That's the only magic tower that's still functioning well enough to energize Mana Orbs.
7721 : Ask Pore-Ohre at the Horutoto Ruins to find out how to energize Mana Orbs properly-woperly.
7722 : You could find it to be quite a troublesome task, so if you are not quite sure of yourself, ask some of your fellow adventurers for help. Well, good luck and ta-taru!
7723 : Lately a lot of monsters have started to roam about under the southeastern magic tower, so make sure you're prepared for adventure.
7724 : Once you have filled all of the Mana Orbs with magical energy, please bring them back here to me.
7725 : Oh, and unless you have all six of the dark Mana Orbs placed in their respective receptacles, the magical energy of the tower won't flow through them at all. Make sure you have all six in position before you flick the switch on the big magical gizmo at the back of the tower's base.
7726 : Well, take care, now. Try not to get into too much trouble.
7727 : Ask Pore-Ohre in the southeastern magic tower of the Horutoto Ruins to find out how to energize Mana Orbs properly.
7728 : Once you have filled all of the Mana Orbs with magical energy, please bring them back here to me. I'll be waiting for you.
7729 : Almost all of the Horutoto Ruins were blown to pieces twenty years ago due to the enormous magic of the heroic Mastermind of the Millennium.
7730 : The only magic tower left barely functioning, the southeastern one, is totally unstable-wable in the amount of energy it produces.
7731 : So it's nigh on impossible to create quality Mana Orbs, which leaves us weakened dramatically.
7732 : Mana Orbs are the hearts of Cardians, you know? If a Cardian were to lose its Mana Orb, it would return to being just an inanimate straw dolly-wolly.
7733 : And, if the magical energy in the Mana Orb ever runs out, even if you were to re-energize it with the gizmos in the magic towers, they still forget everything that they remembered up to then.
7734 : Either way, this is what's considered as death for Cardians.
7735 : The reason that the life span of Cardians has become shortenedy is that the quality of the Mana Orbs has worsenedy.
7736 : Just when the monsters are growing strongery and we need more Cardians than ever before, too... I'd hate to think what lies aheady if things go on like this...
7737 : What? Some feral Cardians turned up againy-wainy?
7738 : It's quite an embarrassing tale for us at the Manustery, but some of the old Cardians from the war years escaped and went wild...
7739 : Those old Cardians carry out such wickedness as stealing Mana Orbs and attacking people.
7740 : Mana Orbs are their hearts, remember? So the reason they steal the Mana Orbs is to revive their friends who have run out of magic in their Mana Orbs.
7741 : But Mana Orbs are just spheres of magic. Unless there is a mage who can use the Mana Orb and breathe life into the Cardians, they are totally useless.
7742 : So even if they are successful in stealing the Mana Orbs, it serves them no purpose...
7743 : But I'm glad that you and poor Pore-Ohre are safe. That's the most important thing.
7744 : Well, anyway, thank you for all your trouble and hard efforts. Until next time, then, ta-taru...!
7745 : I hear that the Cardians who have escaped from our care have been gathering underground in the Horutoto Ruins and plotting bad deeds.
7746 : If we leave them aloney-woney, the magic energy in their Mana Orb hearts will run out, and they will return to being nothing more than straw dolls.
7747 : But someday I'll have to do something about the problem... Someday...
7748 : Thank you very muchy-wuchy! Looks like you have re-energized all of our Mana Orbs. What a great help you were!
7749 : But I'm glad nothing disastrously bad happened... Lately some of the people who have volunteered for this mission have been attacked by feral Cardians at the exit of the Horutoto Ruins!
7750 : When you go about breathing life into the inanimate, who knows what will happen? We're just asking for trouble.
7751 : But that's just a risk we Manustery employees have to take! It's just that...I wish they paid us a little more as hazard pay.
7752 : The previous minister was a terrible man. When the war ended, he started throwing away our Cardians left, right and center.
7753 : Of course the Cardians are going to run away. And of course they are going to come back and kidnap the previous minister. He should have seen it coming!
7754 : It's said that underneath the southwesterny tower of the Horutoto Ruins is the graveyardy where the souls of the thrown away Cardians lingery.
7755 : Minister Apururu once saidy that saving the souls of such automatonys is the responsibility of the Manustery.
7756 : So, have these missions helped in making you stronger? Perhaps you're about rrready for a mission that involves the Yagudo beastmen.
7757 : On the other side of West Sarutabaruta is a place called Giddeus--the home of the Yagudo.
7758 : You know the Yagudo, don't you? They are the beastmen who for ever so long have rrravaged the grasslands of Sarutabaruta.
7759 : But the current Star Sibyl took it upon herself to try and make amicable rrrelations with the damned enemy...
7760 : As a rrresult, we have to pay tribute to the Yagudo with food offerings as a sign of our friendship. That's the crux of this mission.
7761 : First, you are to go to the Rrrhinostery's biological laboratory in Windurst Waters. The rrresearchers there will provide you with today's food offering for the Yagudo.
7762 : The rrresearchers will tell you what you are to do next.
7763 : This is an important mission issued by Heavens Tower, or more specifically, the Star Sibyl herself. Control your hatred of the beastmen and fulfill this mission as best as you can!
7764 : Grrr... Dammit! How long do we have to go on paying tribute to scavengers who could double-cross us at any time?
7765 : Anyway, you had better head on over to the Rrrhinostery in Windurst Waters, and pick up the food offering that the rrresearchers there have prepared for you to offer at Giddeus.
7766 : I, I understand totally-wotally what the Star Sibyl is saying...
7767 : The Star Sibyl is thinking first and foremost of the safety of us Windurstians.
7768 : I just don't underrrstand why the Tarutaru fear those Yagudo.
7769 : Like, wasn't it because of that old Shadow Lorrrd that they nearly lost the war twenty years ago?
7770 : With him dead and burrried, even if we were to have an all-out war with the Yagudo, we'd still come out on top...I think.
7771 : It's not like we're mindlessly opposed to a frrriendship pact with the Yagudo.
7772 : Those Yagudo don't keep their side of the barrrgain. We have the old saying of never share a meal with those who do not keep their prrromises.
7773 : So you completed the mission...? Then I shall be rrrecommending you for promotion to rrrank two.
7774 : I suggest you try your hand at conquests now, as you'll need to gain more rrrank points before we can issue you further missions.
7775 : You can gain the rrrank points you need from participating in the rrregional conquests. Ask the War Warlock guard in charge of conquests over there for further information...
7776 : See you around.
7777 : Grrr... You went ahead and fulfilled that mission, huh? That means we gave the lazy Yagudo nourrrishment to make them stronger...I think.
7778 : Captain Rakoh Buuma also disagrrrees with the Star Sibyl on this, y'know? We should just rrrefuse to hand out this mission from now on...I think.
7779 : W-well done! I knew you could do it. I, I hope you didn't get hurty-wurty.
7780 : If only those Yagudo would let down their guardy-wuardy a bit, we wouldn't have to go through all that just to give them their offerings.
7781 : Even though you got promoted to rank two, you're still an underrrling. But don't be disappointed...
7782 : Underlings can get out of work without otherrr people complaining much. And you can also secretly eat some snacks too, if you're carrreful.
7783 : Have you ever been to the Optistery's Library of Magic in Windurst Waters?
7784 : Looks like they're in a spot of trouble there, as they are urgently asking for any able adventurer we have on hand to go help them out.
7785 : How about it, then? If you feel you're up to it, why don't you volunteer to help the Optistery out?
7786 : Accept Mission? Accept. Decline.
7787 : Then proceed to the Optistery's Library of Magic immediately. It's on the north side of Windurst Waters--the building that the rrroad to the north gatehouse rrruns through.
7788 : The Library of Magic is northwest of here in Windurst Waters--the area furthest away from Windurst Woods.
7789 : The library lends out books if you're interested in them... Not that I've ever been there myself.
7790 : I hear they have a problem with people taking out books and never rrreturning them. Grrr... Those Tarutaru are such easy game!
7791 : Th-the Library of Magic isn't magic in name only. Almost all the books there have some sort of enchantment-bechantment cast upon them.
7792 : W-when you check a book out, the librarians temporarily remove the magic for safety's sake. But, but, sometimes they've been known to forget, so be careful!
7793 : I've borrowed books from the Librarrry of Magic too, you know.
7794 : One time I took a book home to read, and as soon as I opened it a whole army of frrrogs came jumping out at me!
7795 : I borrowed as many books as I could following that, but never had a single frog pop out at me. Too bad, as they were really tasty frrrogs, too!
7796 : You'rrre going to the library, huh? That reminds me...I have a book overdue there...I think.
7797 : What? You want to know what book I borrrrowed? Well, I'm not telling, so there!
7798 : (Don't ask me what book I took out. It's not like I actually read them... They'rrre way over my reading age.)
7799 : You want to know if I have a restrrricted book in my possession, do you?
7800 : Where in Vana'diel did you hearrr that? You can never be too carrreful, you know.
7801 : Okay, I'll let you in on it. You're a second rank adventurer, arrren't you? Then allow me to ask you this little favor I have firrrst...
7802 : If you scratch my back, I'll scrrratch yours...so to speak. Do what I ask and I'll let you check the book I found. How about it, then?
7803 : Hear her favor? Listen. Refuse.
7804 : If that's how it is, then farrrewell, sucker.
7805 : Did you know that up in the Tahrongi Canyon, there is a serrries of caves known as the Maze of Shakhrami?
7806 : If you examine the rocks in those caves with this % harrrd enough, you should be able to find %. I want you to brrring me one. Happy hunting!
7807 : In the Tahrongi Canyon, there is a serrries of caves called the Maze of Shakhrami.
7808 : If you examine the rocks in those caves with that % you have therrre, you should be able to find %. I want you to brrring me one. No coral, no deal!
7809 : You also want that book we found, don't you? Then you'll be needing something to trade the top cat with!
7810 : Heh-heh-heh... We don't deal in cold, hard gil, you know? We much preferrr small and pretty valuables...
7811 : Hah! If you want the book we found, then you'rrre in for some major wheeling and dealing with the top cat, arrren't you, now?
7812 : Why's that, you say? Well, even that greedy, rich merrrchant from Windurst Waters is... Oops!
7813 : Ignore what I just said. I'll make lute strings out of your guts if you tell anyone what I just let slip!
7814 : So, you came thrrrough with it? Here, I'll give you this key. We'll make the trrransaction at my hideout, deep in the Horutoto Ruins.
7815 : You go on ahead. I'll catch up with you therrre once I've finished up herrre!
7816 : We'll carry out our little trrransaction at my hideout, deep in the Horutoto Ruins.
7817 : You go ahead. I'll catch up with you therrre!
7818 : I'm surprrrised you were able to find what we wanted. Now I can harrrdly wait to join the top cat in making the deal with you. Heh-heh-heh...
7819 : You should alrrready know this, but don't you dare tell anyone about the little deal we'll be making. You'll have a cat in hell's chance of living if you spill the beans on us.
7820 : I can't stand the sight of you. Get out of herrre, and don't show yourrr face to me any time soon.
7821 : Some Carrrdians were carrying several larrrge boxes out of the Priming Gate in Windurst Walls.
7822 : It was fun pulling a swift one on them, but it wasn't worrrth the trouble. Don't you darrre say crime doesn't pay!
7823 : I meowed her once, I meowed her a thousand times. We should stop putting our paws on anything that smells of Carrrdians.
7824 : I neverrr want to go through that sorrrt of thing again!
7825 : You came at just the rrright time. We just rrreceived a rrrequest for help in a large-scale mission from Heavens Tower, but we're short of adventurers to dispatch just now.
7826 : The secretary of Heavens Tower will explain what this mission entails. Proceed there immediately.
7827 : Heavens Tower is north of here in Windurst Walls. You should have the details explained to you by the secretary there.
7828 : Gee... I, I wish I could join in this mission-wission too!
7829 : B-but I'm too scared to ask Sola Jaab, in, in case she literally b-bites my heady-weady off!
7830 : Once you accept this mission, you won't be coming back here any time soon, y'know. And just when I was almost getting to like you...I think.
7831 : Once you go to another countrrry, you'll realize just how good old Windurst is.
7832 : The food is great, you can cat nap as much as you like, and turning up late is the norrrm. Everyone takes life easy herrre.
7833 : Ah, %! Heavens Tower is hailing you!
7834 : Why, the head Sibyl Guard herself, Semih Lafihna, came asking for you! Seems your activities in all three nations have become your ticket to move up in the world, eh?
7835 : Anyway, you should hurry on over to Heavens Tower. She's as strict on herself as she is on others!
7836 : Semih Lafihna, eh? I don't know why, but I'm just not fond of that girl.
7837 : Anyway, get a move on to Heavens Tower. She's strict on herself and on others!
7838 : Oh, so look who gets to meet Semih Lafihna...
7839 : Everyone always arrrgues over who's the better archer, Captain Rakoh Buuma or Semih Lafihna, y'know. But Captain Buuma is the best, of courrrse...well, at least that's what I think.
7840 : Sibyl Guards aren't loved by the Mithra as a whole verrry much. We don't like people who take on fancy titles and think they're betterrr than the rest of the tribe.
7841 : What's more, that Semih Lafihna is so serrrious and hard worrrking, her tail is so slim and shiny, and she's also such a know-it-all. Doesn't she just make you jealous?
7842 : S-Sibyl G-Guards are the Mithra fighter-mighters who, who serve and protect the great Star Sibyl.
7843 : M-most of the M-Mithra in Windurst serve their tribal chieftainness. So you see...Sibyl Guards are special-wecial, even in the Mithran society.
7844 : This mission has been issued by the head lady-in-waiting of Heavens Tower, Zubaba.
7845 : Not that I know much about her myself, but Zubaba has been serving as head lady-in-waiting since the current Star Sibyl was a child...
7846 : She's not a character you dare keep waiting. I rrrecommend you hurry on over to Heavens Tower. If you fulfill a mission from the head lady-in-waiting well enough, it's bound to improve your rrreputation.
7847 : This mission has been issued by the head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba.
7848 : Seems that they were impressed by your efforts in your previous mission. If you want to keep in their good books, I suggest you rrrush on over to Heavens Tower.
7849 : The head lady-in-waiting, Zubaba, is expecting you at Heavens Tower. Please proceed there immediately!
7850 : If you complete this mission well, it's bound to improve your rrreputation. Do a good job, you hear?
7851 : Tarutaru girls all want to become ladies-in-waiting, y'know? Like, what's wrrrong with them?
7852 : Perrrhaps it's similar to how little Mithra girls go through a stage where they all want to grow up to become Huntresses of the Sun...I think.
7853 : I hear there are many ladies-in-waiting who serve the Star Sibyl on the second floorrr of Heavens Tower.
7854 : Sounds as though they do all the cleaning, washing and cooking there. Grrr...
7855 : A, a mission from Z-Z-Zubaba!?
7856 : Wow!  You mean, Zubaba's still alivey-wivey? Gee...
7857 : We have a formal writ of summons from Heavens Tower for you. One with a special star emblem on it signifies it is officially a mission of the utmost importance.
7858 : It rrreads that you, %, are to make yourself present at the Planetarium of Heavens Tower with precipitate haste. This is supposedly the greatest honor a citizen of Windurst can have.
7859 : For a formal writ of summons to be issued from Heavens Tower means an extremely important announcement will be made.
7860 : This also means you are no longer just a simple adventurer, my friend. Keep your wits about you! We'd like to escort you to your meeting, but alas, we are unable to rrright now.
7861 : What's going on? What's this starrr emblem thingo? I don't underrrstand...I think.
7862 : Miiri-Wohri's been carrying on all excitedly there by himself, y'know? I don't get it at all!
7863 : I don't see how anyone can get so excited about a piece of paper. Paperrr's something that even goats eat. Totally worrrthless!
7864 : ...Actually, I'm only saying that 'cause I'm jealous. I wish I got one of them wrrrits too! That's so cool!  You're so lucky!
7865 : I-It's the first time I saw the real thing! I was the one who took the delivery of your writ...so I was able to touch it!
7866 : Wow! It's, it's, it's like I touched the hand of the Star Sibyl...only indirectly! Woooo! I'm sooo happy to be alivey-wivey!
7867 : You haven't heard? An emergency order has been issued to the guards and a select few adventurers deemed most loyal to Windurst.
7868 : The issuance of missions has been halted, pending further notice from Heavens Tower. Please stand by until then.
7869 : You haven't heard? An emergency order has been issued to the guards and a select few adventurers deemed most loyal to Windurst.
7870 : The issuance of missions has been halted pending further notice from Heavens Tower. Please stand by until then.
7871 : Did you hearrr? Did you hearrr? Captain Rakoh Buuma was called to the Mage Academy, y'know?
7872 : It's an emergency situation, so the captains of each of the fourrr guardhouses were asked to assemble. Sounds like they had a secrrret meeting or something...I think.
7873 : Seems like something bad happened in the central towerrr of the Horutoto Ruins.
7874 : Semih Lafihna, the Sibyl Guard, had a black look on herrr face as she ran by here en route to the Horutoto Ruins. Then she came back a little while ago looking even angrierrr!
7875 : My! W-Windurst is in a state of emergency... I, I just hope nothing has happened to our blessed-wessed Star Sibyl!
7876 : If, if anything were to happen to her, Windurst would be ruined! It's b-beyond the depths of despairy-wairy!
7877 : This is a fearful matterrr! The wind is in turrrmoil. This porrrtends that something forrrmidable has occurred!
7878 : In times like these you should not lend yourrr earrr to the buzz of people. Instead, you should train your spirit to listen to the grrreater voice around you...
7879 : ...... I sense something peculiar is going on. Something as big as naturrre, yet totally contrary to it, has descended upon these lands...
7880 : An emergency mission addressed to you has been issued once again from Heavens Tower.
7881 : You had better hurry to Heavens Tower and rrreceive your exact orders there. Seems as though you shall be traveling to the ends of Vana'diel.
7882 : The ancient rrruins of Fei'Yin...? I thought it was just the subject of fairy tales...
7883 : Have you rrreceived your exact orders yet? If not, then you had better hurry on over to Heavens Tower to rrreceive them. Sounds like you'll be traveling to the ends of Vana'diel.
7884 : The ancient rrruins of Fei'Yin...? I thought it was just the stuff of fairy tales...
7885 : What does our trrribal leader think of all this...I wonder?
7886 : When the emergency situation arrrose, did the Star Sibyl inform our tribal leader? ...I don't know. I hope Heavens Tower didn't give our tribal leader the cold shoulder. I'd never forrrgive them for that!
7887 : The talisman that disappeared from the Horutoto Ruins was supposed to have been separated between the three countrrries.
7888 : Windurst notified the other two countries immediately, so theirrr talismans should be safe. I'm sure they'll up the guard once they've hearrrd what happened.
7889 : It, it seems as though the Star Sibyl and her ladies-in-waiting are all safe and soundy-woundy.
7890 : B-but I heard that some rogue broke into the Horutoto Ruins. Wasn't the talisman from the Great War of twenty years ago stored there...?
7891 : I just rrreceived word that the conference of ministers has ended.
7892 : Together with that announcement came another % addressed to you. You had better rrrush on over to Heavens Tower again.
7893 : I've rrreceived word that the conference of ministers has ended.
7894 : Together with that announcement came % addressed to you. You had better rrrush to Heavens Tower.
7895 : It's extrrremely rare for the five ministries to suddenly hold a meeting, y'know?
7896 : It's prrractically impossible to gather the ministers of the five ministries together, so they usually announce these things months in advance...I think.
7897 : The situation took a turn for the worrrse there, but it seems all-out warfarrre has been avoided.
7898 : Oops...but that was meant to be a secrrret. We're not allowed to tell people about you-know-who being resurrrrected, or how war was about to break out... It would be widespread panic.
7899 : I, I heard all sorts of nasty rumors about the meeting of the five ministries, but according to the fortune read by the Star Sibyl, Windurst's future is meant to be bright.
7900 : So, so there's no need to worry. There's no way a war will break out. You, you can take my word for it!
7901 : The ministerrr of the Orastery just went out through that gate, y'know?
7902 : Maybe it has something to do with that starrr emblem letter from Heavens Tower...I think? I wonderrr what is written in those letters?
7903 : The situation took a turn for the worrrse there, but it seems all-out warfarrre has been avoided.
7904 : Oops...but that was meant to be a secrrret. We're not allowed to tell people about you-know-who being resurrrrected, or how war was about to break out... It would be widespread panic.
7905 : I, I had the pleasure of delivering a, a star emblem letter from Heavens Tower to the Minister of the Manustery, Miss Apururu.
7906 : M-Miss Apururu was so pleased, she let slip a little about what's been going on.
7907 : I, I'm glad nothing really-weally bad ended up happening. Phew! Makes you appreciate the peace we have now.
7908 : You wish to borrow one of our chocobos? Then speak to the choco-gals in front of their steeds. Any disrespect to them will not be tolerated!
7909 : Howdy! I'm a choco-gal! I look after the chocobos here. Say, have you learned how to ride a chocobo yet?
7910 : We want to make sure you know how to handle our chocobos before you try to ride them. Please don't do anything that might damage our cute little chickadees.
7911 : Yee-haw! We're the choco-gals--the chicks who look after the chicks, if ya git what I'm sayin'. You heard about us from Quesse, didn'tchya?
7912 : Be kweh-reful with our chocobos, y'hear? They maght haive a pretty face, but if ya ruffle thar feathers the wrong way, ya'll be in fer a doozy of a time.
7913 : Hidey-dee! I'm a choco-gal from head to toe! I look after these chocobo where'ver I go. If how to ride chocobos is what you wanna know, then speak to stablemistress Quesse, and get in gear and go!
7914 : Our chocobos just love their gysahl greens, I like 'em too, they're better than beans! Remember chocobos ain't no machines, so look after 'em, if you know what I means!
7915 : If at first a chocobo don't take a likin' to ya, then try givin' it its favorrrite food. Why, that's how I tamed this boy herrre!
7916 : Gee-whiz... I don't know... Can chocobos fly? If they can't, then why do they have wings...?
7917 : (Lost in thought on the subject, Matata didn't get any work done today, either...)
7918 : Care to spare me an ear for a second, pardnerrr? You see, this one chocobo here hasn't been verrry well lately...
7919 : I've got the poorrr thing resting up, but he doesn't seem to be getting any better...
7920 : I consulted the apothecary, who said she'd make me her secret cure-all medicament.
7921 : Yee-haw! Wouldn't that be grrreat, eh? My sick little boy will be all better then, thanks to that!
7922 : Seeing as I have to stay and keep an eye on him, I was wonderrring if you would be so neighborly as to go to the Mithra apothecary and see if the medicament is ready or not...
7923 : Agree to help out? Agree. Decline.
7924 : So you'rrre too busy, huh? Dang it! Reckon I'll have to ask someone else, then...
7925 : Thank you for offering to help. The Mithra apothecary is nearrr the dhalmel farm. Please check and see how theirrr secret cure-all medicament is a-goin'.
7926 : Hurry up and go to the apothecary, y'hearrr? This hyar sick chocobo is sweatin' his tailfeathers off while he's waitin' for that secret cure-all medicament!
7927 : Why, that Mithra apothecary is very kind...even though she is a Mithra.
7928 : I bet that's her motherly love showing itself. They say a woman changes once she has a child...
7929 : You came from the Chocobo Stables, did you? So you're afterrr that secret cure-all of mine, then?
7930 : The trrruth is, I lack a vital ingredient needed to make that medicament. It's called %.
7931 : Accorrrding to the staff of the dhalmel farm, there aren't any % left in Sarutabaruta.
7932 : So, if you come by any % somewhere, then please bring it to me!
7933 : Accorrrding to the staff of the dhalmel farm, there aren't any % left in Sarutabaruta. So, I can't make the medicament to help that poorrr chocobo.
7934 : If you happen to come by any % somewhere, then please brrring it to me!
7935 : You managed to get hold of %? You did well to find such a rarrre plant!
7936 : Now I can make my secret cure-all medicament. Thank you!
7937 : Oh...and tell Kuoh Rhel back at the Chocobo Stables to hold on a little while longerrr.
7938 : I'm starrrting to make the medicament now. So please tell Kuoh Rhel at the Chocobo Stables to hang in there forrr a little bit longer.
7939 : Now I see...  The apothecary was out of ingredients, so she had you go fetch them for her, huh?
7940 : Well, thank you for going through all that trrrouble. You've helped us out so verrry much. I'm just glad the little guy doesn't have to suffer much longerrr.
7941 : Once my little chocobo friend here is back on his feet again, I intend to spoil him with his favorrrite treat!
7942 : I do declare, that sickly chocobo is a bit different from them other chocobos.
7943 : Why, his favorite meal is not % like normal chocobos, but the stew made by the chef at the Culinarians' Guild. Isn't that just the darndest-warndest?
7944 : Howdy, pardnerrr! Still having a mite bit of trouble with my blue little chocobo friend herrre.
7945 : I was wonderrring whether you could go ask Ranpi-Monpi at the Culinarians' Guild to make us some more of his special stew again.
7946 : Help her out? Agree. Decline.
7947 : Why, thank ya! Mighty obliged to you, pardnerrr!
7948 : Oh, fiddlesticks! Why won't this boy eat the food we give him?
7949 : Oh, fiddlesticks!
7950 : You may recall I spoke with you about my sickly chocobo friend here before, pardnerrr?
7951 : Well, that secret cure-all medicament from the apothecary finally came, but it's too darn bitter, so the silly bird won't swallow it!
7952 : I've tried mixing it into his usual food, but he just won't touch it. I'm in a real fix!
7953 : I finally got the secret cure-all medicament from the apothecary, but it's too darn bitter, so the silly bird won't swallow it!
7954 : I've tried mixing it into his usual food, but he just won't touch it. I'm in a real fix!
7955 : Why don't y'all try mixing that bitter medicament into some of Ranpi-Monpi's special stew from the Culinarians' Guild?
7956 : Why, I do declare, I've seen that there chocobo wolfing down that special stew like there's no tomorrow! Surely he won't notice if you mix some medicament into his stew, now will he?
7960 : Why, if it ain't that special stew...and this chocobo's favorrrite food! Yippee! Why didn't I think of it soonerrr?
7961 : Thank you, pardnerrr! I bet if I mix some of that secret cure-all medicament into this stew, he'll gulp it down for surrre!
7962 : Wow! Looks like it worked wonderrrs! Yee-haw! Just look at the little guy gobbling down his medicament!
7963 : Here's a li'l token of my apprrreciation! Mighty obliged to you again, pardnerrr!
7964 : Why, that Ranpi-Monpi's special stew surrre is something, ain't it?
7965 : Keep eating it up, boy, 'cause it'll make you well again, okay?
7966 : I wonder why that chocobo turned all sickly in the first place? It don't look like no disease I've ever seen...
7967 : P'haps he ate something that disagreed with him on one of his journeys? Say, did you know that there's some dang awful mushrooms in them San d'Orian lands?
7968 : Why, once you've ate one of the consarned things, you just can't stop and eat more and more! It can git so bad, all you wanna eat's them mushrooms! Darn nasty-wasty work, thems!
7969 : This is the Boneworkers' Guild. As the name implies, this is wherrre we craft bone into all mannerrr of goods.
7970 : Bone is lightweight but fragile in its naturrral state. Once you've learrrned the Mithra's boneworking methods, however, you'll be able to make weapons that are easy to handle and most effective.
7971 : Allo-allo! If you're after boneworking materials, then make sure you buy them herey in Windurst! We're the cheapest in the whole wide worldy!
7972 : Well, we're actually the same price as Jeuno...but if you consider how much it costs you to travel-wavel to Jeuno, we're not exactly lying then, are we?
7973 : Oh, that Retto-Marutto... If he keeps carrying on while speaking to the customers, he'll get in trouble with the guildmaster again!
7974 : Oops, then again, I'd betterrr show you what we've got in stock...
7975 : Hidey-ho! This is the Boneworkers' Guild, if you haven't noticed, boneworking was originally a Mithra craft, so that's why there are so many Mithra here!
7976 : When animals die, they leave theirrr bones behind. We forrrge their bones into arrowheads and use the arrows to fell other animals. Then when we eat those animals, theirrr bones remain to be used.
7977 : It is all one great cycle wherrre nothing goes to waste.
7978 : If you want to learn how to craft bone into something useful, then you should study with us here at the Boneworkers' Guild.
7979 : It looks as if war is about to break out, so I foresee that we'll be short of hands.
7980 : This is the Weavers' Guild. As you can see, skilled craftspeople are busy creataruing all kinds of fabrics, clothes and headwear.
7981 : Windurst is famous for its magical cloth! Capes and hoods with all sorts of special properties are made out of such cloth here.
7982 : Sew...I mean...So, want to get your paws on the top-quality materials as used in the Weaverrrs' Guild?
7983 : Then step rrright up and take a look! Just be carrreful not to get too giddy with excitement, now!
7984 : If you're interested in buying some works of art from our Weavers' Guild, then you've come to the right placey-wacey.
7985 : We weave our own fabrics here. The materials used in our cloths can vary from grub's silk to plant fibers. Why, we even mix such materials together for the best of both worlds!
7986 : Um...  Maybe it'll work if I do this and then do this... No. That won't do...! Humph...
7987 : You can't make quality fabrics unless you know the strengths and properties of your raw materials. The stockpiling of decades of wisdom is not limited to the realm of magic books, you know!
7988 : I thought I'd learn myself a trade, so I joined the Weavers' Guild as an apprentice. They keep me busy day in and day out, but I guess that's how I'll improve. After all, they do say you reap what you sew, you know?
7989 : This place is hanging by a thread! Naw... That was a fabrication! I was trying to pull the wool over your eyes. Hahaha... Just being a knitwit!
7990 : This is the arrrchway to Windurst Walls, the hearrrtland of Windurst.
7991 : In the centerrr of Windurst Walls is a giant star tree that grew out of and then encompassed Heavens Tower. That's where the Star Sibyl, who rules overrr our federation, lives.
7992 : Head down this road to get to the harborrr area.
7993 : Oh, and if you'rrre planning to board an airship, make sure you get there on time! The airrr travel agency doesn't wait for anyone!
7994 : Arrrgh... I'm soo borrred! I wish something would happen to get my hot Mithran blood running again!
7995 : How I envy adventurerrrs like you. What I'd give to be able to head out into East Sarutabaruta and blow up some balloons forrr a bit of stress relief!
7996 : Mithra are purrretty good with their hands, you know? Why, we even give the Tarutaru a rrrun for their money! That's why there are so many guild buildings in Windurrrst Woods.
7997 : By the way, up this path, you can see the Weaverrrs' Guild. Behind the Weavers' Guild is the Boneworkerrrs' Guild.
7998 : If you can't find what you want at Nchaa's Good Goods shop up therrre, then try heading over to street stalls in the Bomingo Round.
7999 : You might experience some serendipity therrre. There's one guy at the local restaurant who claims he always makes grrreat finds at those stalls.
8000 : We Mithra may live freely, but we know rrright from wrrrong.
8001 : That Cat Burglar, Nanaa Mihgo, may think she has everyone fooled with that cute act of hers, but a crrrook is a crrrook! Don't let yourself be taken in by herrr or herrr gang!
8002 : Would you shut this little cub up for me? She is too pesky and noisy forrr her own good!
8003 : The Sibyl Guards are not real Mithra because they werrre raised by Tarutaru! I don't carrre how strong they are. They've lost the Mithra spirrrit.
8004 : Craft skills require you to practice overrr and overrr, wasting many items, until you learn how to synthesize and create things properrrly.
8005 : But when you finally can create weapons and other cool stuff that aren't found at the shops, then it finally becomes worrrth all that efforrrt. At the very least, you can show off to your frrriends!

8018 : The rain in La Theine falls mainly on the plains.
8019 : To protect the future of our children, we adults must give first priority to the maintenance of peace.
8020 : It is for this very reason that the great Star Sibyl, in her infinite wisdom, made a peace accord with the Yagudo beastmen.

8023 : Hi-diddly-diddly! I am Apururu, the current minister of this Manustery and its Cardian workshop. Nice to meetaru!
8024 : This is where we breathe life into the automaton guards that we call Cardians.
8025 : You are free to look around, but we ask that you don't go teaching strange things to our newly created Cardians!
8026 : The way you're walking around here, I'd swear you think that this ministry is an unusual sight.
8027 : Hm? You think our Cardians are odd? Well, I'd say you're the odd one around herey-werey!
8028 : This is the Manustery--the ministry that's in charge of making and maintaining Cardians. Most people just refer to us as the Cardian workshop.
8029 : The automaton guards you see working all over Windurst are born and raised by us here. Don'taru think it's kind of amazing, kid?
8030 : I'm still newy around here, so they won't let me helpy out in creating Cardians yet.
8031 : But I so want to hurry up and test my strengthy. I bet I can make a really-weally strong Cardian!
8032 : ONE'SGREE-TINGIS... HELLO!?
8033 : TWOISCAR-DI-AN! YOUISPEO-PLE!

8036 : THER-R-RAININLATHEINEFALLSM-M-MAIN-LYONTHEP-P-PLAINS!
8037 : I cannot read its model number, but this is one of our children who left our ministry and died somewhere out there...
8038 : I think it must have been quite lonely-wonely... Oh, but thank you for bringing this back to us!
8039 : I heard about you, adventurer! It seems that you turned out to be quite the hero...
8040 : Thank you for saving Windurst...no...for saving our whole world!
8041 : By the way...you didn'taru happen to bump into my big brother, Ajido-Marujido, along the way, did you? He dashed out of Windurst by himself, saying, The time is ripe! You should come along too!
8042 : I no longer care what happens to him. So, if by any chance you do meet up with him, tell him I said he can carry out his crooked-wooked schemey-whemies all by himselfy-welfy! Humph!
8043 : Why, hello there, friend! Step right up here and tell me this--are you satisfied with our current Cardians?
8044 : Satisfied with Cardians? No, not quite... Yes, most sufficient.
8045 : Gee...  You don't have to be such a wet blanket...
8046 : Well, have I got just the right thing for you! A brand new make of Cardian, I call...
8047 : Tada!!! The All-New C-2000!
8048 : So how about it, then!? Do you have the inclination to go down in the history of our nation by helping in the creation of this amazing new innovation in automatons?
8049 : Want to go down in history? Yes. Sign me up now! No, I'm turning you down.
8050 : Gee... What do you have to be such a wet blanket for...?
8051 : Oh, good! Stick with me, kid--with my brains and your brawn, we're bound to go places together!
8052 : You see...I just happened to be in the process of teaching The All-New C-2000 the scents of different enemies. The All-New C-2000 has a better nose than us people do, you knows?
8053 : For starters, I was hoping you could bring me some of the items that the monsters in Sarutabaruta drop.
8054 : Let me see... % and %...
8055 : Oh, and % would be nice to begin with. So good luck and goodbye! See you when you've obtained one of each of those items...
8056 : Have you obtained the items I need to educate the All-New C-2000 yet?
8057 : Don't forget, now... I need %, %, and %.
8058 : So hurry, hurry! You don't want someone else to beat you to it, and have their name go down in history instead of yours, do you?
8059 : Cardians aren't people, you know-whow? They are like dolls made out of all sorts of materials. We place the magic on those dolls that breathes life into them.
8060 : But each and every Cardian is an individual. The character of the person who casts the life-giving magic on them is reflected in their personalities, too!
8061 : The Cardians that Kopuro-Popuro makes cause all sorts of trouble. We can't take our eyes off of them for too long...
8062 : Minister Apururu is too soft on him. The future of our Manustery is bleak indeed!
8063 : Mister Kopuro-Popuro mixes and matches the magicky he casts on Cardians in order to animatey them.
8064 : The life-bringing magicky used on Cardians is extremely difficult to do. Wow, I hope if I keep practicing hard enoughy, I'll also be able to performy all sorts of variations of that magicky just like he does.
8065 : Mighty obliged to you there, friend. Your name will go down in Windurstian history for sure now!
8066 : So don't complain if your reward isn't as good as expected, kid.
8067 : This is how we teach the Cardians we create to remember all kinds of things.
8068 : I guess it's kind of like being their mother or father.
8069 : Hey, you've come back here again?
8070 : Oh well, seeing as you're here, you might as well make yourself useful. You see, I've just made another new type of Cardian. This time, I'm calling it...
8071 : Tada!!! The All-New C-2000!
8072 : Huh...? Whaddayamean, Yeah, yeah, I've heard it before?
8073 : Next you'll be telling me you know what items I want you to bring, rightaru? Anyway, I guess that means you'll be helping me out, then?
8074 : Agree to help him out? Yeah. Naw.
8075 : Gee...you don't have to be such a tease!
8076 : Great! Head on out to Sarutabaruta and procure me those items, then!
8077 : ONE'SGREE-TINGIS... ONE'SGREE-TINGIS...?
8078 : What is Spare One's greeting? Gimme five! Hang ten, dood! Wassuuuuuup?
8079 : ONE'SGREE-TINGIS... GIMMEFIVE!
8080 : ONE'SGREE-TINGIS... HANGTENDOOD!
8081 : ONE'SGREE-TINGIS... WASSUUUUUUUUP?
8082 : Don't go teachying that kiddy strange wordies! It's practically impossible to make Cardians forgety something once they memorizey it!
8083 : That Spare Oney there is but a newborny Cardian! So he memorizes anythingy and everythingy without reservation.
8084 : The other day Kopuro-Popuro went and taught one of our Kindercardianers the words hats suck and upset old Boizo-Naizo to no end.
8085 : Newborn Cardians are just like ordinary people's children, so you have to teach them to use words properly-woperly!
8086 : Hey, you therey! Remember that Cardiany you taught a silly greeting to the other day?
8087 : That poor Cardiany just wouldn't forgety the words you taughty it.
8088 : Seeing as it was you who taughty the poor thingy an inappropriate greeting, you should take responsibility for your actions and teachy him a correct way of greeting otheries!
8089 : If somethingy's not done, he'll have to livey in embarrassment as a poorly-trained Cardian for the resty of his days. Wouldn't that be a pity-wity?
8090 : Think it's pitiable? Yes, that's sad. Not really...
8091 : You inhumane brutey! Have you no feelingies?
8092 : As Cardians grow up and rise in ranky, their names changey. So, that Spare Cardian you spoke to backy then has a different namey that goes with the position he filledy.
8093 : I think his namey is now Five of something-or-othery...?
8094 : Well, I don't knowy...!? Their names changey so much, it's practically impossible to keep tracky of who's who!
8095 : Anyway, try going aroundy and talking to the Cardians of each suit with the namey Five, and use the greeting you taught him as a signy to tell him apart from the otheries.
8096 : The Cardian whose lifey you ruined by teaching him a silly greeting should now be named Five of something-or-othery...?
8097 : Anyway, try going aroundy and talking to the Cardians of each suit with the namey Five, and use the greeting you taught him as a signy to tell him apart from the otheries.
8098 : The Cardians of Windurst are dealt out numbers in the order that they are born. When their numerical predecessor breaks down, all the Cardians below him rise in rank to fill out the numbers of a full deck.
8099 : So the more Cardians that become run-down or destroyed, the faster the numbers in the names of their successors change.
8100 : Oh, you mean that Cardian...? So he's grown up to become number five already, huh?
8101 : <Sigh>... When I hear that, it brings home to me just how short the lifespans of our Cardians are becoming...
8102 : I believe that particular Cardian you speak of was made by Kopuro-Popuro.
8103 : Kopuro-Popuro has a habit of forgetting important things while always remembering the most useless of information. Like father, like son, eh?
8104 : So, did you findy him...? What do you meany, he's outsidey of town? Eh? He's that far away from towny?
8105 : What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy! Here...takey this as a little thank-you for finding himy!
8106 : If he stays outside of towny too long, there's a chance people might mistakey him for one of those feral Cardians and killy him!
8107 : What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy!
8108 : If he stays outside of towny too long, there's a chance people might mistakey him for one of those feral Cardians and killy him!
8109 : What's he doing in such a dangerous placey? We'd better hurry and send someone out to bring him backy!
8110 : It is true that the numbers the Cardians are called by change a lot lately, but we should not forget the individual students behind those names.
8111 : This facility is different from schools where they teach people how to study-wudy. This is more like a home where we raise children in a loving way.
8112 : Say...I wonder whether that Cardian properly forgot the hats suck line I taught him?
8113 : I don't think we should force Cardians to forget things they don't want to forget.
8114 : It wouldn't hurt for our Cardians to have a little more individuality now, would it?
8115 : We're in deep water, everyone!
8116 : We're in the red again this week.
8117 : And after all of those cutbacks we've been implementing lately, too...
8118 : I'd like to ask you all for ideas... How can we get some gil back into the Manustery's coffers?
8119 : I know, Minister Apururu! It looks like it's time to implement Legendary Plan B!
8120 : Legendary-wary?
8121 : Plan B?
8122 : Long, long ago, our old Manustery was facing a financial crisis much like we are today...
8123 : This was in an age long before airships connected the cities of Vana'diel with the convenient network we have now.
8124 : Back then, travelers on their way to Jeuno were menaced by fearsome nocturnal-wurnal monsters.
8125 : To brighten up the future for those travelers, our predecessors, in their great wisdom, devised a charm for trekkers they called the Gadabout's Gris-gris!
8126 : The effect of these charms was astounding, and the reduction in the number of dangerous incidents that befell Jeuno-bound travelers was significant.
8127 : Hmm... Oh, really? Well, I don't know whether it's true or just an old wives' tale, but we could make a load of gil by selling such charms to the local goods stores, couldn'taru we?
8128 : That was mighty useful information, especially coming from the likes of Kopuro-Popuro. So, how does one go about making these Gadabout's Gris-gris thingamabobs?
8129 : Well, you need all kinds of items that nocturnal monsters drop when defeated.
8130 : In order to make a charm, I think we just need: %, %, and %.
8131 : I see... Great! Then we'll just make a heap of them to sell. We'll have money back in the Manustery's coffers in no time!
8132 : You'll help us out as well, won'taru you? Please collect one of each of the items that the nocturnal monsters drop.
8133 : Remember, we need %, %, and % to make one charm. Good luck, kiddo!
8134 : Hmm... That's the first I've heard of the Legendary Plan B.
8135 : I didn't realize our ministry has been this poor for so long! I don't know whether I should take comfort from it, or fall into even further depression...
8136 : So...I wonder how many of these Gadabout's Gris-gris thingamabobs we have to make to bring our budget back into the black.
8137 : Well, finances aren't my concern, so I'll just concentrate on making the goods. I'll just keep making Gadabout's Gris-gris until we all drop from exhaustion.
8138 : We've decided to go aheady with our Legendary Plan B--to make and sell special charmies that protect people who travel by nighty.
8139 : The best thingy is that they don't require any special magicky--so long as we have the right materialies, they are easy to makey!
8140 : Oh, %, %, and %... Looks likey we have everything!
8141 : Here's your cut... Good work, kid!
8142 : We're in deep water, everyone!
8143 : We have mountains of unsold stock! That means mountains of debt!
8144 : Lately adventurers have been culling nocturnal monsters down to controllable levels, so traveling by night isn't as dangerous as it used to be. This means our charms aren't selling at all!
8145 : I'm putting an end to Legendary Plan B. Now I've got to calculate how much more in the red we are after that harebrained scheme!
8146 : Here...I'll give you one, too. Just get the silly thing out of my sighty-wighty!
8147 : <Sigh>... I know, I know...you don't have to tell me. I should have realized this was a stupid idea earlier...
8148 : I don't get it... What went wrong with Legendary Plan B?
8149 : I know...I bet someone deliberately set out to interfere with my plan! Yeah, that's it. Someone must have employed adventurers to go out and hunt nocturnal monsters.
8150 : It just goes to showy...if you have a fingery in more than one pie, you're going to get your fingers burnedy...
8151 : That was a good lessony in the nature of businessy. There are pitfalls in diversification after all.
8152 : Mountains of unsold stock! Mountains of debt!
8153 : Minister Apururu!
8154 : It's Queen of Hearts, Miss! She's come back all wounded and hurt!
8155 : !!!
8156 : You should stay there, kid. I think the minister is giving Queen of Hearts its last rites.
8157 : Queen hAd a hap-py lifE... Under tHe Blue Skies...!
8158 : Queen's Only Re-gret iS Queen oF Dia-monds dId not mAke iT back hEre tOo...!
8159 : I understand, Queen of Hearts... Don't you worry about Queen of Diamonds. I'll look after her...
8160 : Thank you for a long life of diligent service. Now you can rest in peace, my dear...
8161 : I'm sorry for keeping you waiting, adventurer. A life had to return to the stars just now...
8162 : She came back all the way here to me, despite her decrepit state...
8163 : I'm just glad I was able to say a final farewell...
8164 : Well, anyway, adventurer... You surely have traveled the world by now and seen many sad things yourself.
8165 : I have a request for one such as you. Please tell me if you happen to find a Cardian named the Queen of Diamonds. I'll pay you # gil for information about her whereabouts.
8166 : If she's on her way here too, then that can only mean she is seriously hurt as well. Please hurry and find her for me...
8167 : I'll pay you # gil for information on the whereabouts of a Cardian called the Queen of Diamonds.
8168 : If she's on her way here too, then that can only mean she is seriously hurt as well. Please hurry and find her for me...
8169 : No mattery how many times you experience it, saying our last goodbyes to our Cardian kiddies is a sorrowful thingy.
8170 : <sniff> It's all the more painfuly when it is a Cardiany you breathed life into and raised with your own handies. <sob> Waaah!
8171 : The Cardian who died just then was one that Minister Apururu raised personally...
8172 : That Cardian was able to make it back here with her remaining strength, but I fear Queen of Diamonds was not so lucky...
8173 : Even if we only find one of her parts, at least we'll be able to give her a proper burial...
8174 : What the...? She's offered to pay you # gil to find our missing Cardian? That's just the kind of stupid thing that puts us further and further into the red!
8175 : If that Cardian's on its way back here, then it only means it's going to kick the bucket at any moment, rightaru?
8176 : So why pay such a high price to find something as drop-dead useless as thataru!?
8177 : It's like, why spend so much money on silly personal sentiments, when putting that gil towards creating a new Cardian is in everybody's interests?
8178 : I'm sorry, but this time I'm going to have to put it to our Minister quite bluntly-wuntly!
8179 : Even if you or anyone else finds old Queen of Diamonds for us, we won't be coughing up a single gil, I tell you! I'm totally against such tomfoolery!
8180 : First, against nature, you go provide lifeforce to empty vessels. Then you send them out into the battlefields. If you're going to cry about it when they drop dead, then you'd might as well not make the damned things to begin with!
8181 : Even if you or anyone else finds old Queen of Diamonds for us, we won't be coughing up a single gil, I tell you! I'm totally against such tomfoolery!
8182 : I cannot read the marking, but this is a part of one of our children who left this ministry and died somewhere out there...
8183 : Oh...?
8184 : What's that I see on this starfruit?
8185 : Look how it glitters so beautifully... And that shape... Why, it almost looks as if it's...
8186 : a...
8187 : Here. Please show this to Boizo-Naizo.
8188 : Please show that starfruit to Boizo-Naizo.
8189 : ......
8190 : Oh, that's worthless. Such garbage deserves to be thrown into the trashcan.
8191 : Oh, I see you found a piece of her, huh? This nut is indeed part of what was once the great Queen of Diamonds.
8192 : Its marking has worn away, but I know a diamond house when I see it. See, I'm the one who makes the Diamond Cardians, you know?
8193 : But I don't intend to pay you a single gil! It's still worthless garbage, even if it was one of my own. I'm different from Minister Apururu, you see. I don't allow my feelings to get caught up in my work...
8194 : ...Huh? What's this here...?
8195 : Was this on the starfruit when you found it?
8196 : This ice...!? Why, its shape looks...almost like... ...a tear...
8197 : Ah... It's melting...
8198 : ... Well, I guess the Minister did promise it to you, so...I'll pay you the reward for finding this starfruit.
8199 : But # gil is asking too much. Sorry, but you'll have to make do with # gil.
8200 : No, I've not become all emotional, mind you! It was just a doll into which we breathed temporary life, rightaru?
8201 : First, against nature, you provide lifeforce to empty vessels. Then you go send them out into the battlefields. If you're going to cry about it when they drop dead, then you'd might as well not make the damned things to begin with!
8202 : Did Boizo-Naizo really just dish out # gil just then?
8203 : I don't know where such an amount came from, as our Manustery certainly doesn't have that to spare... Ah!
8204 : That's rightaru...he was just saying that he finally saved up enough gil to buy the latest hat creation from the hatter! You don'taru suppose he used that money to pay you, do you?
8205 : Cardians are life forms born by borrowing the power of the stars. They are just like us--beings with a lifeforce that comes down from the heavens.
8206 : So we should never forget... A Cardian's lifeforce is not something we created. We simply called that power down to the earth.
8207 : That's why we should send off that life when it leaves the earth, telling it that we hope to meet again.
8208 : Ice in the shapey of a tear... Ice that didn't melty until it touched the handies of Boizo-Naizo... There are many unexplainable mysteries in this worldy.
8209 : Say... I wondery if Cardians can cry? There is no such devicey built into them to enabley them to, though...
8210 : Haw!? Yeah, that be rrright! I look afterrr these here dhalmel all by m'self, y'know! Why, you ain't got an issue with that, do ya?
8211 : Oh, and while y'all are herrre... Don't ya go taumentin' the poorrr things, now! Not if y'know what's good for ya!
8212 : Lately them crrrawler crrritters out thar in Sarutabaruta have been eatin' up all the % that these dhalmel love so much.
8213 : It's put me in a rrreeeal fiddle, 'coz now I have to work rrreeeal hard to git me some of them thar %.
8214 : I do declare... You seem to be the adventurrrer type now, huh!? Would you mind doin' me a favor the next time yer out thar a-huntin' in Sarutabaruta, and concentrate on depleting the numberrrs of crawlers in them parrrts?
8215 : If ya cull enough of them crawlers to git your hands on three % or %, then I'll give you a little somethin' as a rrreward! Whaddaya say?
8216 : Help cull them thar crawlers? Yup! Naw!
8217 : I see... So, y'don't give a damn 'bout what happens to my dhalmel, then do ya? You yellow-strrreaked crrrawler-kisser, you!
8218 : Crawlers can be found in both East and West Sarutabaruta. So exterrrminate as many of them thar pesty crrritters as you can in both'a them parts.
8219 : Them crawlers are out of control, and I'm at my wit's end! Cull enuff of them critters to git your hands on three % or %, and I'll pay you a rrreward!
8220 : Crawlers can be found in both East and West Sarutabaruta. So exterrrminate as many of them thar pesty crrritters as you can in both'a them parts.
8221 : Why, thankee you, pardnerrr! Seems like y'did indeed kill off a mighty big numberrr of them thar crawlers. Here's ya rrreward! Much obliged to ya.
8222 : If everrr ya have the time, would ya be so good as to cull some morrre of them thar crawlers for little ol' me? Cull enuff of them critters to git your hands on three % or %, and I'll pay you a handsome rrreward!
8223 : You saw them towerrrs out thar in Sarutabaruta, huh? Why, they be called the Horutoto Ruins. Once they broke down, the animals of Sarutabaruta starrrted runnin' amuck, y'know?
8224 : I ain't got much of a clue what them towers was forrr, but they sure was magical. I wonderrr if they'll e'er be able to fix them up again?
8225 : In Mother Nature, there is nothing that is without purrrpose...nothing is wasted. Both you and I are here for some rrreason.
8226 : One should never waste naturrre's gifts, and never take a life, no matter how small, without properrr cause. That is the hunting code we rangers are sworn to uphold.
8227 : Please do not botherrr us now. We are in the midst of offerrring our prayers for a great hunt.
8228 : We rangers must show gratitude for naturrre's blessings as we carry out the hunt. For we too are part of Mother Nature's grrreater scheme...
8229 : Have you everrr thought about how the food you eat each day arrives on your plate?
8230 : Yes. When we die, we too will be eaten by someone or something. In the end, we all returrrn to the earth to serve as nutrients for otherrr living things.
8231 : You are entering into the prrresence of Chieftainness Perih Vashai, the one who unifies the Mithra of Windurst.
8232 : Verily, she is the Mithran heroine who wields the crrrimson arrow and the azure bow. Be carrreful, lest you are overwhelmed by her peaceful vigor.
8233 : Blessed is the one with the crimson tides flooding through herrr breast and the azure glow beaming from herrr eyes.
8234 : Forrr only one such as that may inherit the chieftainness's bow and arrow.
8235 : I brought my daughterrr here to meet the tribal chieftainness, and have herrr highness see just how the child is grrrowing.
8236 : The chieftainness inculcated my daughter on the Mithra spirit--the teachings of a people in harrrmony with naturrre. This is just as my motherrr had done forrr me.
8237 : Wanna know why the chieftainness keeps herrr eyes closed all the time?
8238 : It's so she can hearrr the voice of naturrre betterrr!
8239 : Have you hearrrd, adventurer? Our world is once again in an uproarrr.
8240 : We are on the path to great wars and the spilling of much blood. If those times do indeed come, I shall be forrrced to hand the bow of the chieftainness on to a Mithra who has found a new road to walk, one who has new drrreams for her people.
8241 : We have received worrrd from Rakoh Buuma, captain of the eastern gatehouse.
8242 : We are afraid it is ratherrr ill news. Nothing good happens on days when the wind blows warrrm.
8243 : What we fearrr is about to happen is by no means certain. However, if our worst fears come to pass, then we will need a strong chieftainness who can rrraise the lands and lead our arrrmies.
8244 : We cannot ask this of our elderrrly chieftainness. Will we need to select a new leaderrr even while our current chieftainness still lives...?
8245 : Have you hearrrd, adventurer? There appears to have been a grrreat battle far off in the Northlands.
8246 : I assume the worrrld will quiet down for a while now. However, the hearts of the Mithra will continue to clamorrr, for we Mithra know that nothing has rrreally ended at all.
8247 : Why? Why is it that my hearrrtbeat will not settle down?
8248 : Lo! The chieftainness appearrrs to be sensing something. What is going to happen next?
8249 : No one is willing to say it out loud, but we all feel that something is about to occurrr.
8250 : It was exactly the same twenty years ago. There was a grrreat sense of loss back then, as if some grrrand presence had suddenly disappeared. But what was it that was lost?
8251 : In Mother Nature, there is nothing that is without purrrpose...nothing is wasted. Both you and I are here for some rrreason.
8252 : One should never waste naturrre's gifts, and never take a life, no matter how small, without properrr cause. That is the hunting code we rangers are sworn to uphold.
8253 : Have you, my child, trod on many a land, drunk from many a rrrainfall, fought many a fine battle, and lived to see many a dawn?
8254 : Then truly I say unto you, unless you are apprrroved by the earth and the sky, how is it that you can say you are accepted by Mother Nature?
8255 : If you so desire to submit yourself to the laws of naturrre, my child, then go, meet with the fanged king of the beasts, and bring back one of his grrreat teeth.
8256 : Listen to the voice of nature and wait for nature to run herrr course. If nature accepts us, then even we who lack fangs will be perrrmitted to hunt as her rangers.
8257 : My child, if you desire to submit yourself to the laws of naturrre, then go, meet with the fanged king of the beasts, and bring back one of his grrreat teeth.
8258 : Listen to the voice of nature and wait for nature to run herrr course. If nature accepts us, then even we who lack fangs will be perrrmitted to hunt as her rangers.
8259 : The fanged king of the beasts is one of the grrreat tigers. It is a fearsome monster with swift feet and awesome power. Its teeth are very light yet extremely strong, perrrfect for making the best arrowheads.
8260 : From long ago they have dwelled on the Sauromugue Champaign, and we have learrrned much from them.
8261 : What is it you want to learrrn from us, the people of nature?
8262 : While you say you want to leave some legacy for the futurrre, you plunderrr whatever you can here and now.
8263 : If you stopped for a moment and thought, you would rrrealize that at this rate you will have nothing left to give yourrr descendants.
8264 : Those who say they want to leave some legacy for the future, while plunderrring whatever they can here and now, live contrary to nature.
8265 : If they stopped for a moment and thought, they would rrrealize that at this rate they will have nothing left to give theirrr descendants.
8266 : Why, my child, did you cause yet anotherrr of nature's wonderrrs to die meaninglessly? It is useless to even try and explain this fang's meaning to one such as you.
8267 : For the hunterrr, the fangs are not just a tool vital for existence, but also a witness to its death. If the fanged one loses its fangs, it can no longerrr live. Yet when the fanged one dies, only its fangs rrremain.
8268 : To hunt like the fanged one, you must live by the fang and die leaving only the fang behind.
8269 : Onto you, our new ranger, I bestow the witness of the life and death of the grrreat fanged one...
8270 : You can now become a ranger!
8271 : The one unto whom Mother Nature has bestowed her fangs must neverrr fight without reason.
8272 : Glorrry to the fangs of the fanged one. Listen to the voice of nature and follow her courrrse. The sky and earrrth shall tell you the time to fight and the time to die.
8273 : Why do you suppose people lost their fangs? Perrrhaps it was because people stopped listening to nature's voice.
8274 : That weapon you hold in your hands is but a temporrrary manifestation of a fang. Your true fangs exist within your hearrrt!
8275 : There are no meaningless lives in this worrrld, yet there are a great numberrr of meaningless deaths.
8276 : Never forrrget, fanged one... Never forrrget the sinfulness and folly of causing an unnecessary death.
8277 : Hey! What do you want? Don't tell me...
8278 : You heard that I have a monster correlation chart and came to beg me to show it to you, rrright?
8279 : Look at the tattered diagram? Yes. No.
8280 : Oh, so you're just trying to flirt with me, huh? Well, sorry there, but I'm not interrrested in men or women. The only thing that makes my heart leap are the tracks and droppings of my next hunting game, thank you.
8281 : I knew it! Alrrright then. I don't mind showing it to you. Besides, I'm a topnotch hunter, so I don't need it anyway.
8282 : I was given this parchment a few years ago by a scrrruffy old Elvaan man. I helped him out when I found him lost in the woods, and this was his way of paying me back.
8283 : To tell you the truth, I wasn't that interested in it, so I didn't pay much attention to his explanation and have forrrgotten most of what he said.
8284 : It was something about how the different types of monsters eat each other in order to surrrvive, so I guess he was trying to tell me to referrr to this pattern when I go hunting.
8285 : But whenever I spot a monster, I become totally obsessed by the thought of the hunt and forrrget all about his advice and this chart.
8286 : Maybe it's enough to just keep this knowledge locked away in the back of your mind somewhere, in case you ever need it. But if you want to know more, then you'll just have to go and track down that old guy.
8287 : You're welcome to have another gander at this chart whenever you want to. It's a pain to explain it to everyone who asks, but maybe it is some kind of fate... Actually, I've found that I enjoy helping people out.
8288 : Through this archway lies Windurst's residential area. There is a Mog House room preparrred for your use in there.
8289 : Say... You haven't had Mog Houses explained to you beforrre? Well then, allow me to fill you in!
8290 : Listen to Mog House explanation? Yes. No.
8291 : A Mog House is your own perrrsonal apartment room provided for your convenience.
8292 : Within your Mog House, you can storrre items, change jobs, and heal your HP and MP.
8293 : You're a citizen of Windurst, right? Then there's no hassle. You should already have a Mog House preparrred for you up the stairs here.
8294 : It's your own room, so you can use it however you see fit. Why don't you go up there now and take a little nap to refrrresh yourself?
8295 : Through this archway lies Windurst's residential area. There is a Mog House room preparrred for your use in there.
8296 : Say what...? You want to hearrr my explanation of Mog Houses again, do you?
8297 : Oh well... Yourrr loss.
8298 : Through this archway lies Windurst's residential area. There is a Mog House room preparrred for your use in there.
8299 : Let me see... You currently have a Rent-a-Room leased out in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], rrright?
8300 : Do you want me to returrrn the Rent-a-Room in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi], and have your belongings brought back to your Mog House here in Windurst?
8301 : Move out of Rent-a-Room? Yes. No.
8302 : Ho-hum...ho-hum... There, it's all settled. The keys to your Rent-a-Room in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Kazham/Rabao/Norg/Al Zahbi] have been returrrned. Have a pleasant rest.
8303 : Beyond this arrrchway is Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for people's use.
8304 : Say what...? You already have a Rent-a-Room! In that case, you can go directly into your room. You don't have to come and get perrrmission from me every time, you know?
8305 : Beyond this arrrchway is Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for people's use.
8306 : Let me see... You're not a citizen of Windurst, rrright? In that case, do you want me to prepare a Rent-a-Room for you here?
8307 : When you lease a Rent-a-Room here, you can use that room as you would use your own personal Mog House back in your home country. Prrretty convenient, huh?
8308 : Lease a Rent-a-Room? Yes. No.
8309 : Ho-hum...ho-hum... There, it's all settled. You now have your own Rent-a-Room preparrred for your use in Windurst's residential area behind me. Have a pleasant stay.
8310 : What's up with you? Why are you standing there in a daze?
8311 : Hmm... You call yourself an adventurrrer? I guess if one stretches her imagination enough, you could almost look like one.
8312 : Let me take a stab in the darrrk and guess that this is your first time in Windurst.
8313 : First time in Windurst? Yes. No.
8314 : Well then, welcome... Yes, welcome to peaceful old Windurrrst. Scaredy-cats who have been dumbed down by the peace are enthusiastically received here.
8315 : Good try... But if you're going to deceive people, you should at least learn how to lie properrrly.
8316 : Where are you heading? What brings you to town?
8317 : What do you want to do right now? Head outside and battle. Go shopping. Gather information. Where am I? Who am I?
8318 : Grrr... You'rrre more hot-blooded than you look. I could almost come to like you.
8319 : But judging from your delicate appearrrance, I'd say you'd be lucky to beat a rarab, let alone a mandragorrra, out there in Sarutabaruta.
8320 : Oh, in case you didn't know, Sarutabaruta is the name of the grasslands that surround Windurst.
8321 : If you go back up that slope behind you and pass through the gatehouse, you will come to East Sarutabaruta.
8322 : Sarutabaruta is full of weak monsters, so even a newbie like you can try to hunt there.
8323 : But be warrrned. The furrrther you go away from town the strongerrr the monsters become, so keep an eye on your map.
8324 : Ask your fellow adventurers for details on the best way to fight or flee. I can't be botherrred telling you myself.
8325 : Well, I've helped you enough forrr today. I'm sure you get the idea.
8326 : Nanaa Mihgo's lesson on Windurst is overrr. I've discounted your tuition fee to a mere 1000 gil. Come on then, cough it up.
8327 : Pay the tuition fee? No way! Well, er, okay...
8328 : What!? You won't pay me even a simple compliment, despite my kindly assistance!? Don't you know basic adventurrrer's etiquette?
8329 : Show me how much you've got in your purrrse.
8330 : You catch on quick, kid. I'm beginning to think I could like you.
8331 : Hold it right there!
8332 : Nanaa Mihgo!!! You're up to your old tricks of duping travelers out of their hard-earned gil, aren't you?
8333 : We, the Star Onion Brigade, won't let you get away with it!
8334 : Grrr, not those S.O.B.'s again! I would've gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids!
8335 : Due to this disturrrbance, I'll have to end your lesson forrr today!
8336 : We'll continue anotherrr day, and that's when I'll collect my fee.
8337 : Hey, she's getting away! After her!
8338 : Hey, don't run so fasty-wasty!
8339 : <Sigh>......
8340 : Dat mithwa is a weally bad mithwa we all call da Cat Burglar.
8341 : If you need weal help, head towards da fountain. Jack of Spades is on guard around dere. He will teach you all you need to know. Check da Map to find da way dere.
8342 : Oh, and give Jack dis. You can give it to him by using da main menu's Trade option.
8343 : Ah, we forgot to intwoduce ourselves. We are da Star Onion Bwigade! We are da pwotectors of a bwighter tomorrow! It'll pay you to wemember us!
8344 : What the...? Shopping? Asking me's a waste of time.
8345 : I mean a waste of my time, not yourrrs! If you must ask, then all I can recommend is to head to Port Windurst.
8346 : To get there, head down the road on the otherrr side of this fountain round.
8347 : Once in the porrrt, head down to the wharves, where there are three boat-shaped shops. They house a magic shop, an armor shop, and a weapon shop.
8348 : If you're looking for shops in the Windurst Woods area, there's a general goods store far over on the otherrr side of those tents there. You'll find the Boneworkers' Guild and Weavers' Guild shops back behind therrre too!
8349 : And up behind the dhalmel farm, therrre's a Mithra apothecary.
8350 : You should know this already, but you can make money by selling the items that monsters drop after you defeat them. You can use the gil earrrned to buy whatever you want.
8351 : The best way to gather inforrrmation is to speak to all the townsfolk.
8352 : Today I'll throw in some special tidbits for free...but just this once. What kind of information in particularrr are you interested in?
8353 : Ask for information on...? Helping people. Monster patrol. Easy money. Looking for work.
8354 : Why not try the Manustery's Cardian worrrkshop up there? You won't only be helping people, but Cardians as well.
8355 : Oh, Cardians are the magical automatons that function as the guarrrds of Windurst.
8356 : If you go in that workshop there, you'll see morrre of them than you probably want to.
8357 : Perrrsonally, I'd prefer if all the Cardians were rounded up and destroyed.
8358 : Hah! If therrre was such sweet talk of fast money, I'd have done it already.
8359 : But wait a second. Let me see... What could be suitable for a newbie like you...?
8360 : You know the Boneworrrkers' Guild to the south of here? If you diligently practice that trade skill, you might make some money out of synthesizing and selling items.
8361 : You'rrre not going to strike it rich right away, but it's a relatively easy way to make money. Hey, it's a start, right?
8362 : Norrrmally, I'd say, Go out and slaughter those Yagudo beastmen!
8363 : But the Tarutaru of Windurrrst like to keep the peace and are trying to be friends with the Yagudo.
8364 : So at this point, all I can recommend to you is the dhalmel farrrm.
8365 : If you head north from here, you'll see the long necks of the dhalmel sticking up over the farrrm's walkway. Inquire with the farrrmer. She's grateful for any help she can get.
8366 : Looking for worrrk, huh? Then head to one of the gatehouses.
8367 : There's one right behind you. The stone building there is the Eastern Gatehouse. It's swarrrming with those preening Mithra guards.
8368 : You can receive missions from the gatehouses if you're into volunteerrring for your country. Perrrsonally, I don't care much for it myself, so ask for details at the gatehouse.
8369 : Missions are tasks from and on behalf of the Federation of Windurst, and differrr from the requests for help from general townsfolk.
8370 : For instance, if you do so-and-so a mission, you are rewarrrded with a set number of rank points.
8371 : Collect enough rank points and your rank or position in this country will rise. But as far as I'm concerned, the rewards aren't worrrth the effort.
8372 : Hm? You don't know left from right? You poorrr thing.
8373 : This is Windurst Woods, the easternmost of the fourrr districts of Windurst.
8374 : Seeing as we're nearrr the Bomingo Round here, I'll use it as the starting point of my explanation.
8375 : Firrrst, if you head south from the round, there are several shops run by the local craftswomen.
8376 : There's the Weavers' Guild, which is the specialty of the Tarutaru, and there's the Boneworkers' Guild. which is more the Mithra's forte. These are the pride and joy of Windurst.
8377 : If you head north from the round, you'll find roads that lead to the dhalmel farm and Chocobo Stables. Just follow the sweet smell of naturrre.
8378 : Take the road norrrth, and you'll find an apothecary mixed among the Mithra Groves with the Mithra houses. Take the road south, and you'll find an auction house.
8379 : Compared to the other districts, there's hardly any Tarutaru buildings in Windurst Woods at all. However, the Manustery, one of the five ministries, is right therrre.
8380 : That building up high there is the Manustery's Cardian workshop. It's where those Cardian guards are manufacturrred.
8381 : Finally, heading west from the round will take you to Windurst's residential area.
8382 : If you're a citizen of Windurst, you can use one of the Mog Houses inside of therrre.
8383 : Ask the guards at the entrance there forrr the details.
8384 : Why, hello there, adventurer. I have a puzzling little problem you might be able to help me with...
8385 : A while ago, I came into the possession of something called %, which has given me the spooks.
8386 : I've heard that its previous owners have all had the most bizarre things happen to them.
8387 : I've tried to get rid of the damned thing, but somehow it keeps making its way back to me. So...I was wondering if you can do something about this ribbon before I go quite crazy.
8388 : Help Roberta with her ribbon? Accept. Decline.
8389 : Don't tell me you're too scared! Why, you looked like the type who could help an old lady.
8390 : I'm almost afraid to get you caught up in this business as well, but thank you for agreeing to help me out. Handle it with care, now...
8391 : Why, hello again, adventurer. I still have that puzzling little problem you were supposed to be helping me out with...
8392 : Remember that % I gave you? Well, by any chance, did you happen to lose it?
8393 : Lost the ribbon? Yes. No.
8394 : I knew it! I knew it! You won't believe this, but that % I gave you somehow made its way back to me again!
8395 : Please. I beg you. Do something about this ribbon before it drives me crazy!
8396 : Really?  Hmm... No matter then...
8397 : Hey [Mister/Ma'am]... Are you going to take me home...?
8398 : That ribbon is not for sale, and I certainly wouldn't buy it back from anyone. Yet, somehow it manages to come back here to me. What's going on...?
8399 : That ribbon is not for sale, and I certainly wouldn't buy it back from anyone. Yet, somehow it manages to come back here to me. What's going on...?
8400 : You don't have to tell me anything about the background of that ribbon. I don't want to know.
8401 : In this weird world of ours, some things are better left unknown.
8402 : So...you've found me, huh? Yeah, I know, I know. Don't tell me--our editor, old Naiko-Paneiko, is all in a huff over wanting us to cough up our news scoops, rightaru?
8403 : Hmm... What should I do? You see, I have a great scoop, but haven't been able to confirm whether it is indeed true or notaru.
8404 : So I could let you just take it to him, but a good reporter should always double-check her sources, rightaru?
8405 : Say, perhaps you could check my story out, and go see if the facts match up before you submitaru it to him? Maybe you could also get a few other adventurers to help you out and serve as witnesses...?
8406 : To finish your job by confirming my news scoop, head into the depths of the eastern magic tower and find out whether the Cat Burglar's hideaway really does existaru there.
8407 : I don'taru suggest that you actually go inside her hideaway, as the Cat Burglar is bound to have dangerous traps and guards there. Just find the entrance to the place at the back of the Horutoto Ruins...then get the hell outta there!
8408 : I knew it! My sources were correctaru! Race on back to my editor with the scoop before someone else beats us to it!
8409 : This year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism is in my pocket for sure! I'll make sure I thank you in my acceptance speech!
8410 : The Cat Burglar-wurglar...? Oh, you mean Nanaa Mihgo? Of course I know her!
8411 : They say the treasures she steals from people are never-ever found again. That's why the Mithra guardy-wardies can never arrest her...there's just no proof!
8412 : As I thoughtaru! I won this year's Pulitzer-Bulitzer Prize for journalism with my scoop on the Cat Burglar!
8413 : And it's all thanks to you for helping confirm that it was true. I really want to thank you more, but will this do...?
8414 : I can'taru wait to see our next exclusive issue.
8415 : My expos will be the top story for sure. But I can'taru rest on my laurels. A good reporter has to keep following the truth, as no story ever really ends.
8416 : Can't you see I'm busy now? Give a girl a little brrreathing room, huh?
8417 : You did put the you-know-what into a metal box and sink it in the sea as we were told to, didn't you?
8418 : You've got a cat's chance in hell of getting me to steal something like that again! Next time, you do the stealing, and I do the sinking, okay?
8419 : Ooh... Aah... Ouch...! I don't think our last burrrglary was such a good idea. The wounds where I was bitten by the you-know-what still ache, not to mention my back from carrying that heavy box I put it in.
8420 : What do you mean, my scoop expos has been stolen!?
8421 : That dirty, rotten, low-down Cat Burglar! She's made a preemptive strike so as not to be caught outaru. This is a cat-astrophe!
8422 : Looks like this week's edition of the Tarutaru Times's Magic Paradise Weekly is going to be canceled as well.
8423 : If I said it once, I've said it a thousand times... We should give up on using those silly magic dolls to deliver our stories. and go back to the tried and true method of newspapers and magazines! Our stories always end up never getting told.
8424 : What...? You've brought a Cardian that you want me to have a looky-wooky at?
8425 : I see... Such a misfortunate episode has caused the poor thing to cease functioning.
8426 : The Mana Orb--the heart of this Cardian--is still glowing. This is not a mere case of magic energy depletion. This child's heart has been broken-woken.
8427 : Cardians are automaton dolls created with the help of magic, but their ability to perceive emotions is the same as us people.
8428 : Feelings are something transmitted between people as they gradually grow older. Cardians also develop by picking up many such feelings but, but...sometimes these feelings can even break them.
8429 : This Cardian you brought me was made during the war years, so it has probably felt its fair share of sorrow over its lifetime.
8430 : <Sigh>... I wonder if I can heal the poor thingy-wingy?
8431 : This is not one of the Cardians that I helped create. But...these poor children are still my responsibility...
8432 : I'll... I'll try to re-enchant the magic back into it.
8433 : But I'll need help to carry it out. Would you be so good as to assist me?
8434 : Help fix the Cardian? Yes. Anything to help! Sorry, I can't.
8435 : Thank you for your cooperation. First, I'll need to remove my father's old magic. He was the previous Minister of the Manustery who created this Cardian.
8436 : In order to do that, I'll need to pair it off with its opposing Cardian Card--the ten of cups. I only need a single ten of cups card, so could you be so good as to obtain one for me?
8437 : Some of the old type of Cardians--who are now malfunctioning and breaking down--run wild in the southwestern parts of the Horutoto Ruins. That would be the best place to search. But please be very careful-wareful!
8438 : That's too bady-wady...<sniff>
8439 : The Ten of Cups is the opposing card to our poor little Cardian friendy-wiendy. If you bring me %, I can remove the old magic from him and commence my repairs.
8440 : Some of the old-style Cardians that have long malfunctioned run wild in the southwestern parts of the Horutoto Ruins of West Sarutabaruta. Try searching there. But please be very careful-wareful!
8441 : The magic that we use to breathe life into the automaton dollies can be very dangerousy if used incorrectly.
8442 : It hasn't been as thoroughly researched or perfected as black or white magicy. Often its very use puts the caster herselfy in dangery.
8443 : Cardian Cards have the ability to dispel the magic that has been placed on Cardians...it's kind of like an emergency stop or self-destruct button.
8444 : Minister Apururu's father, the previous minister of our Manustery, could even remove magic without the use of Cards...but without him to show us, it's impossible for us to do it.
8445 : There are many taboos when one breathes life into these automaton dolls, you know, kid?
8446 : One very important rule is to never cast a second batch of magic on a doll that already has magic placed on it. If you're not careful, either you or the doll could die! Shivers!
8447 : Oh, goody-woody! You found it!
8448 : Now you can leave the rest to me. You can tell this child's friends back in Jeuno that it will be a little while longer before he's as good as new.
8449 : But... I need to wipe his Mana Orb clean in order to begin... I must clean away the memories that broke his heart...
8450 : Tell this child's friends back in Jeuno that it won't be much longer before he's as good as new.
8451 : I... I need to wipe his Mana Orb clean in order to begin. I must clean away the memories that broke his heart...
8452 : Ooh, scary-warey! Don'ty you go disturbingy Minister Apururu now!
8453 : The magic needed to breathe lifey into a Cardian are all very delicate operationies. She has to keepy her concentration, she does!
8454 : The minister is so determined-wermined. I don'taru want her to go through with this, but it looks like nothing would stop her now.
8455 : She tends to get carried away when it comes to matters about her father. We have to look out for her as much as we can!
8456 : There are many taboos when one breathes life into these automaton dolls, you know, kid?
8457 : One very important rule is to never cast a second batch of magic on a doll that already has magic placed on it. If you're not careful, either you or the doll could die! Shivers!
8458 : Wot's that you sez? Give you back the book I borrrrowed from the library?
8459 : Why, I always returrrn any books I borrow right on time, thank you! You sure you ain't got the wrong girrrl? Why would they think I've still got a book out?
8460 : Yowl! Wot's that...? %!? Do you think I'm the type to read a book like that? 'ow embarrrrassin'!
8461 : You nincompoop! Never in all me life 'as anyone even suggested I'd borrrrow an embarrassin' book like %!
8462 : It's not just obstruction of business, why, it's violatin' me rights, that's what it is! Get the 'ell outta 'ere before I scrrratch ya eyes out!
8463 : Woowee...! We overhearrrd you! Seems our boss has a darrring side to her after all!
8464 : Woow-woo! You go, girl! Looks like our boss's sprrring has come at last! She doesn't have to deny it so much. Being a closet rrromantic is nothing to be ashamed of...
8465 : Hae Jakhya!? Now you mention it, that is exactly like my name, ain't it?
8466 : Yowl! But 'ow the 'ell could someone mix up a girrrly princess kitten like 'er with a rough and tough lioness like me! That's just not on!
8467 : But, anyways, I'm glad that little matta is overrr! Quite relieved!
8468 : So it was just anotherrr Mithra who has a similarrr name to our boss, Hae Jakkya, who borrowed the saucy romance novel... Well, that was a letdown!
8469 : What a borrring outcome.
8470 : The overdue book was called %, was it? Hmm...
8471 : Oh...? Not that I'd have any rrreal interest in such a thing!
8472 : Tehehe... I keep going out into East Sarutabaruta, hunt a whole lot of Mandragora, collect their four-leaf buds, then come back and sell them off here to make a killing-willing! I'm so richy-wichy now!
8473 : Once I've saved up enough gil, I'm heading off to the shops on the docks of the port area. Any respectable black mage should at least equip herself with %, don'taru think?
8474 : The Cat Burglar-wurglar...? Oh, you mean Nanaa Mihgo! Of course I know her!
8475 : She gets angry-wangry all of a sudden, so she can be kind of scary at times, but she knows a lot of interesting story-wories.
8476 : Elvaan are all so high and haughty. It almost seems like they look down on us Tarutaru at times.
8477 : Huh...? How dare you say that's because we are so short that everyone can't help but look down on us! Beat it before I bite your kneecaps!
8478 : Magical energy is strong all around the vicinities of Windurst, so magical plants thrive here!
8479 : The apothecary down the way combines her Mithran skills with the local flora to create all sorts of new medicinal products.
8480 : Hmm...there's gotaru be some interesting stories floating around somewhere. Hey, you there, [mister/missy]...have you heard any juicy tidbits of information lately?
8481 : I was expecting there to be a fuss among the Mithra over who assumes the chieftainness's throne, but nah... I guess good stories don'taru come that easy.
8482 : We Mithra are often called the people of the woods because we originally lived in forrrests.
8483 : Well, due to varrrious circumstances, we came to live in Windurst. This is a nice place, although I don't think we'll ever come to underrrstand the Tarutaru ways...but they aren't bad people at hearrrt.
8484 : It is trrrue that the Mithra of Windurst obey the Star Sibyl...
8485 : ...But that's only because our chieftainness, Perih Vashai, is doing so herrrself.
8486 : Whenever you look around Windurst Woods you see Mithra, rrright? But just until a few decades ago, this whole arrrea was full of Tarutaru.
8487 : That was until the warrr years when the Mithran chieftainness, Perih Vashai, came across the seas from the Mithran homeland with her arrrmy of fighters.
8488 : Have you seen those automaton guarrrds called Cardians? They are made at the Manustery, herrre in Windurst Woods.
8489 : The Manustery is famous for being the poorrrest of Windurst's five ministries of magic.
8490 : Those automaton guards they call Cardians are said to grrrow smarter and smarter by the day as they learrrn more and more.
8491 : It's only a matter of time until they all start developing their own perrrsonalities and then begin to fight among themselves. Won't that be fun?
8492 : How's it goin', mate? Enjoyin' a spot of adventurrrin', I see...
8493 : Life's long, and you can put off till tommora what you don't wanta do today. So don't you be wearin' yourself out with all that adventurrrin', you hear?
8494 : It's that very attitude that's stoppin' you from ever findin' the old pirate king's treasure, y'know-wow!?
8495 : C'mon, we've gotta getta move on, Gottah! Hurry up and buy that armor you've been wantin' at the port-wort so we can go out and level up some more-wore!
8496 : The firrrst rrrule of the Starrr Onion Brrrigade...!
8497 : Show kindness to any stupid-looking adventurrrerrrs you meet!
8498 : It's firrrst come, firrrst serrrved when it comes to the items put on auction. You'rrre competing in bidding against people frrrom all overrr the worrrld, so don't hesitate if you'rrre not surrre. Just do it!
8499 : I'm starrrving! I'm so hungrrry I could eat a... Hey...can you eat chocobos? I bet they taste like chicken!
8500 : Perih Vashai is a Mithran heroine who rrrendered great service during the war twenty years ago.
8501 : She lost a great many things back then, but never did she lose her pride or break her pledge. It just goes to show that physical strength is not the sole rrrequisite to be a hero.
8502 : Our chieftainness is verrry old... It seems that she wants to pass the chieftainness's bow onto the Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna.
8503 : But I doubt if Semih Lafihna would accept that honorable responsibility. Quite a prrredicament we're in, eh?
8504 : I don't think we've achieved any rrreal peace by making a pact with those Yagudo beastmen!
8505 : But try explaining that to the Tarutaru, and they'll just be all stubborrrn and insist that it's the Star Sibyl's will!
8506 : It's purrr-etty darn hard to catch a dhalmel, you know? Only we Mithra have the necessary abilities to do it propurrrly!
8507 : To carry out that ability, you need something in purrrticular. To give you a hint, it's something that only Mithra have... Purrr...
8508 : The centrrral hub of Windurst is the Windurst Walls distrrrict, with Heavens Tower encompassed by that overgrrrown star tree. You'll get there if you head north strrraight along this path.
8509 : But it's too quiet there, with too many brrridges for my liking. I don't find it the least bit interrresting.
8510 : You know about that mad hatter in the Tarutaru district of Windurst Waters, rrright?
8511 : Well, those Tarutaru have nothing on us Mithra in Windurst Woods! Why, we have our own mad apothecary herrre!
8512 : Hey... How come all the otherrr Mithrrra speak so badly of the Captain of the Sibyl Guarrrds from Heavens Towerrr? She is so strrrong and so cool-looking! Hey... Is she going to be ourrr next trrribal leaderrr?
8513 : Windurst Woods is famous for its dhalmel farm up the rrroad there. You've just got to check it out!
8514 : The cheese made from dhalmel's milk is an acquirrred taste, but once you come to appreciate it, you just can't stop eating the stuff!
8515 : Where did I drop it? Damn, that's going to be impossible to find, too! What a catastrophe...!
8516 : I heard that this was a land with strange animated dolls used as guards, but this surpassed all expectations.
8517 : They say they make these magic dolls in a place called the Manustery. If I were to visit there, I wonder if they would permit me to go a round with one of those ungodly contraptions...
8518 : Ha-ha... Now I get it!
8519 : It's against the rules to ride a chocobo into the town. So that's why those strange automaton Cardian guard things chased me around and around like that!
8520 : Phew-wee... I came all the way over here in search of hints for a new kind of business, but I can't believe my eyes!
8521 : What in Vana'diel are those long-necked animals they have here? Are these also creations conjured up with Tarutaru magic?
8522 : Wee... We're now waltzing in Windurst Woods. Whoa! Want to whirl over to Windurst Waters? Then let me move you in a moment with my mighty magic, maybe?
8523 : Warp to Windurst Waters? Yes. No.
8524 : Welcome to the Windurst Chocobo Stables.
8525 : Huh...? If you be wanting anything therrre, [mister/missy], then hurry up and decide, then get the heck out of herrre!
8526 : Are you in urgent needy-weedy of anything? I have a variety of thingy-wingies you may be interested in.
8527 : I know, I know... I can tell at a glance that you're an adventurer.
8528 : I'm always receiving shipments of goods that you will no doubt find useful. Remember, I'm here to help you. Best of luck on your adventures.
8529 : I am Tapoh Lihzeh the apothecarrry. Is there something you want from me, or are you looking for my daughterrr?
8530 : If you are after my daughterrr, then I suggest you head overrr to Windurst Waters. She's studying at the School of Magic there.
8531 : From humble Mithran cold medicines to the legendary Windurstian ambrrrosia of immortality, we have it all...
8532 : Psst! Hey, you... Yes, you there!
8533 : You like the type of [guy/gal] who'd be interested in my secret cache of wares. Wanna have a little look?
8534 : Psst... Interested in some rrreal hot property? From lucky chocobo digs to bargain goods that fell off the back of an airship...all my stuff is a rrreal steal!
8535 : You're interested in some cheap shopping, rrright? I'm real sorry. I'm not doing business rrright now.
8536 : Ladies and gentlemen, kittens and cubs! Do we have the sale that you've been waiting forrr!
8537 : Sorry, but our shop is closed rrright now. Why don't you go to Gustaberg and help the situation out therrre?
8538 : Why don't you buy something from me? You won't regrrret it! I've got all sorts of goods from the Zulkheim region!
8539 : I'm taking a brrreak from  the saleswoman gig to give dirrrections.  So...through this arrrch is the residential  area.
8540 : Ooh...do I have some great merchandise for you! Man...these are once-in-a-lifetime offers, so get them while you can.
8541 : <pant> I am but a poor  merchant. Mate, but you just wait! Strife...one day I'll live the high life. Hey, that's my dream, anyway...
8542 : Yes. This is the consulate of San d'Oria. How may I be of service?
8543 : I see... You have no business with me. Sorry, but I have work I must return to, so please allow me to continue with it. Good day.
8544 : If I may, allow me to tell you a little about San d'Oria...
8545 : San d'Oria is a land of the sword and of great faith. It is famous for its gallant Royal Knights and loyal Temple Knights, its grand regal chateau, and its glorious cathedral.
8546 : The hymns sung in the cathedral are particularly divine. Even the stoniest of hearts cannot help but be moved by them.
8547 : It is rather impossible to say that the Windurstian government is the most logical system. However, the Tarutaru believe in their Star Sibyl and maintain strong bonds with each other.
8548 : And is it not the faith and the bonds of its citizens that make a country strong? Only when the hearts of the individuals are unified can a government really work.
8549 : This is the consulate of San d'Oria. Our role is to serve and protect the citizens of San d'Oria residing in Windurst.
8550 : But of course, we shan't forsake non-San d'Orian citizens who require our assistance. For we San d'Orians are indeed a just people.
8551 : The light shines where there is righteousness, so do not be afraid, citizen of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]. The soldiers of San d'Oria only unsheathe their swords in the name of justice.
8552 : The light shines only where there is righteousness. Fellow citizen of San d'Oria, never lose the pride you have in your country.
8553 : Welcome to the consulate of San d'Oria. If you wish to speak to Consul Mourices, enter his office through the door on your right.
8554 : So you've come all the way from San d'Oria, eh? Your dedication to serving the motherland is most admirable.
8555 : Unfortunately, I am in one of my moods today. After I read the mission request from Windurst, I became most disgusted.
8556 : Forine, please explain to the [brave man/nice lady] here what the mission entails.
8557 : Yes, Consul. Allow me to explain...
8558 : The mission from the Windurstian government entails the oblation of magic armor to Giddeus, the frontline to the abode of the Yagudo beastmen.
8559 : A magic shield will be handed to you at Heavens Tower in Windurst Walls. Your orders are to deliver it to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep in the underground of Giddeus.
8560 : Have you had the misfortune of meeting the Yagudo yet? They have made a nasty practice out of ganging up to attack the travelers who pass through Sarutabaruta...
8561 : These are the same beastmen who sided with the Kindred twenty years ago, and killed many of our comrades in the war.
8562 : However, the Windurstians have grown too complacent and show their love of pacifism--even if it is nothing more than a one-sided faade--by forming amicable relations with the Yagudo beastmen.
8563 : And now they dare ask us proud San d'Orians to carry a tribute to a pack of beastmen. It would almost be laughable if it wasn't such a slap in the face.
8564 : However, this mission has to be accomplished as part of our pledge to Windurst. We Elvaan are not ones to break our promises, are we?
8565 : And yet, at the same time, as San d'Orians, we cannot allow this injustice to go unchecked.
8566 : The situation is most exasperating. However, I must command you to go and give the Yagudo their magic shield. But at the same time, I entreat you to deprive the other Yagudo you meet along the way of two of their shields, making up for the imbalance.
8567 : Now, off with you!
8568 : However exasperating the situation, I must command you to go give the Yagudo their magic shield. At the same time, I entreat you to deprive the Yagudo you meet along the way twice the number of the shields to make up for the imbalance.
8569 : No Elvaan would ever do something as dishonorable as breaking a promise to another.
8570 : Your orders are to proceed to Heavens Tower in Windurst Walls, where a magic shield will be handed to you.
8571 : In order to accomplish this mission as assigned by Windurst, you are to deliver the shield to the Yagudo treasure chamber, deep underground in Giddeus. However, that is not all...
8572 : While we cannot break our promise to the Windurstians, to ensure justice is served, we would secretly like you to take two shields off of the Yagudo who you meet en route.
8573 : Act according to our convictions while fulfilling our promise with the Tarutaru. This is indeed a fitting course for us, the people of glorious San d'Oria.
8574 : Fool! Did you not hear our orders correctly? Or are you just out to start a war?
8575 : Can you not remember the most important part of the mission? You had to deliver a magic shield to the Yagudo treasure chamber. And you call yourself a San d'Orian!?
8576 : Fool!
8577 : You only handed over Windurst's magic shield to the Yagudo and skipped back, leaving the balance of power skewed. Such action would be considered treason back in San d'Oria!!!
8578 : Humph. Seems as if you were able to maintain the path of righteousness.
8579 : You are now to head to the Consulate of San d'Oria in Bastok.
8580 : Do you know the way to Bastok from here? You can travel by sea from Mhaura back to Selbina. From there, you have to cross the highlands to the south.
8581 : Glory to the Kingdom of San d'Oria. Farewell and safe passage.
8582 : Head to the Consulate of San d'Oria in Bastok.
8583 : The best way to journey to Bastok from here is to ride a ship from Mhaura back to Selbina. From there, you have to cross the highlands to the south.
8584 : The Republic of Bastok is occupied by two races, the Hume and the Galka, who are the exact antithesis of each other.
8585 : Occasionally they break out into fights, so it is imperative that you maintain neutrality as you assess the situation and then avail yourself to the righteous ones.
8586 : Now that you have completed that little mission of amity, you are just an ordinary San d'Orian citizen again. So that frees you to go to Giddeus and really give those beastmen what they deserve.
8587 : However, we shan't take responsibility if you get seriously hurt in the process.
8588 : Your efforts are well noted. Take care on your journey to Bastok.
8589 : So you've come all the way from San d'Oria, eh? Your dedication to serving the motherland is most admirable.
8590 : This mission on the behalf of the Windurstian government displays our country's level of friendship towards Windurst.
8591 : Forine, please explain to the [brave man/nice lady] here what the mission entails.
8592 : Yes, Consul. Allow me to explain Windurst's request...
8593 : A giant monster has appeared in the depths of Giddeus, the borderland to the theocracy of the Yagudo beastmen. The Windurstian government wants it exterminated.
8594 : You are to receive a key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district and head to the innermost part of Giddeus, where the creature awaits.
8595 : Ha-ha! What a jolly tale that is. A ferocious monster appearing in the heart of Giddeus, scaring the Yagudo so much they ask Tarutaru to help them?
8596 : It's most fortunate for those beastmen that the Windurst government had sought amicable relations with them in order to maintain the peace of their country.
8597 : What? Don't tell me you hadn't heard of Windurst's little peace pact with the Yagudo?
8598 : Of course, we San d'Orians have no need to show to those vulgar beastmen any courtesy whatsoever, but this is an agreement between our two countries, so we have no choice but to go through with it.
8599 : So go ahead and exterminate the ferocious monster plaguing the depths of Giddeus, but don't think you have to hold back from also giving those whining beastmen what they deserve.
8600 : Anyway, enough chatter. Godspeed on your assignment.
8601 : Go and exterminate the ferocious monster plaguing the depths of Giddeus, but don't hold back from also giving those whining beastmen what they deserve.
8602 : To access the innermost part of Giddeus, you must receive the key from Heavens Tower in the Windurst Walls district.
8603 : Report back here once you have defeated the ferocious monster that is menacing the Yagudo in the depths of Giddeus.
8604 : I would not try to deny the Tarutaru of this land from pursuing peace. It is just that I desire lasting peace, not the temporary faade that Windurst has now.
8605 : The apparent tranquility of this place can be considered an illusion born from idealism. Until we wake Windurst from its dream it will continue to be beyond help.
8606 : Becoming a soldier is a completely different way of life than being a mere fighter.
8607 : You are caught between intricate orders and chivalry, and sometimes you have to go against your personal convictions...
8608 : What is this you speak? The Shadow Lord is being resurrected!?
8609 : This cannot be! We'll have to report this to the royal family!
8610 : I shall write an epistle. I will need you to deliver it posthaste to Monarlais Halver back in the motherland.
8611 : You must protect this letter with your life. Now hurry and deliver it to San d'Oria!
8612 : What are you dawdling for, [boy/girl]? Did I not order you to hurry back to San d'Oria and pass my letter on to Halver, the Monarlais?
8613 : Consul Mourices's face has blanched. Did you say something to upset him? Did you not complete your mission correctly?
8614 : The ferocious monster was really a trap set by the beastmen...? What a horrid turn of events this has proved to be.
8615 : Moreover, there is talk of a nether beast appearing? Could it be...? No! Do not tell me that we are marching forthright into another Great War?
8616 : You mentioned that when the nether beast appeared, a Mithra guard came to your aid?
8617 : The only Mithra with that degree of strength would be one of the Sibyl Guards from Heavens Tower.

8644 : How about this for a mission? The School of Magic, conducted by the Aurastery, is seeking an able adventurer to help them out.
8645 : However, it seems that this mission will rrrequire several days of hard effort. What do you think? Will you give it a try?
8646 : Accept the mission? Accept. Decline.
8647 : The Aurastery's School of Magic is on the eastern side of Windurst Waters. Just head north from Windurst Waters's rrresidential area entrance.
8648 : The school is full of children striving to become tomorrow's politicians and scholars. Putting up with them is a greater test of endurance than any mission I can issue you!
8649 : The Aurastery's School of Magic is on the eastern side of Windurst Waters. Just head north from Windurst Waters's rrresidential area entrance.
8650 : The school is full of children striving to become tomorrow's politicians and scholars. Putting up with them is a greater test of endurance than any mission I can issue you!
8651 : The, the kiddy-widdies who study at the School of Magic are all super-smart. Once they gra-graduate, they can automatically enter one of the m-ministries.
8652 : In, in fact, m-most go on to become the m-ministers of the m-ministries! S-saying they have great potential is an understatement-batement!
8653 : Why would Tarutaru children everrr want to study at a School of Magic?
8654 : Grrr... I'd hate to be forrrced to sit in front of a desk all day. It sounds like a punishment to me.
8655 : Come to think of it...therrre is a Mithra girl in the advanced class of the School of Magic, y'know?
8656 : She's the firrrst Mithra to make it into the advanced class...y'know? Someone should give herrr a pat on the back, I think.
8657 : Oh, what a cleverrr little kitten you are. Herrre, I'll give you some pocket money from my kitty.
8658 : Hmm... Our top seller is too popularrr for its own good. Even ourrr hidden stash has almost run out.
8659 : I'll need to get my paws on some good % and % in orderrr to make some more.
8660 : Oh! Hey...you're an adventurerrr, aren't you? I'm surrre you've seen either one of these at some time or another. Well, if you happen to come by any of them, would you be so good as to bring me some?
8661 : Agree to help? Yes. No.
8662 : I'll give you # gil forrr three % and # gil forrr two %. Please sell me whateverrr you find.
8663 : I'll give you # gil forrr three % and # gil forrr two %. Bring me whateverrr you can find!
8664 : Mmm... Thanks forrr bringing me such exceedingly good quality material. I'll be able to make some prrretty good lipstick out of this lot.
8665 : Mmm... Thanks forrr bringing me such exceedingly good quality material. These will make perrrfect holders for my special lipstick.
8666 : Traditionally Mithra never worrre lipstick, but lately it's all the rage among the young cubs.
8667 : My lipstick is always selling out, so keep the supply of % and % coming! As you can see, I pay a good price, so please sell whatever you find directly to me.
8668 : If you come across any more % or %, then please sell whateverrr you find directly to me. I'll make surrre to give you the best price around.
8669 : Soni-Muni's me name. I'm currently travelin' the world in trainin' to become the greatest fighter who ever lived, and to git me hands on the greatest treasure that ever was!
8670 : Over there's me mate, Gottah. As you can see, she's one spunky monk-y. Unfortunately, she's lost her motivation and has begun to take it all too easy as of late.
8671 : I'd just luv to rekindle her passion for adventure once again, but blow if I know what to do...?
8672 : Come to think of it...the other day, when I told her the story of the great monk Scorpio who fought a giant scorpion with his bare hands and broke off its %...well, she showed a bit of interest for once...
8673 : My mate Gottah over there has lost all motivation as of late. I'd like to rekindle her passion for adventure, but blow if I know what to do...?
8674 : Come to think of it...the other day, when I told her the story of the great monk Scorpio who fought a giant scorpion with his bare hands and broke off its %...well, she showed a bit of interest for once...
8675 : Of course I've lost me passion for adventurrre! I've come all the way to Windurst lookin' for the old pirate king's treasurrre, only to have 'em tell me that all that talk o' pirate treasurrre is just a fairy tale.
8676 : Speakin' of which...I bet that legend o' the great monk Scorpio who fought a giant scorrrpion with his bare hands was also just made up to excite the kiddies, too.
8677 : Whoa, looky-looky...ain't this somethin'? You didn't happen to break this off with your bare hands, now, did you?
8678 : Hah! Yeah, right...as if...? But anyway, here goes nothin'...
8679 : Oi, Gottah! Getta load of this I've gotta!
8680 : This here adventurer took out a giant scorpion to get [his/her] hands on it. Ain't it somethin'!?
8681 : Ho-hum...
8682 : Oi, oi! Don't be givin' me no ho-hums there, chum! Don't you feel anythin' anywhere in that heart of yours?
8683 : Think about how this wishy-washy excuse for an adventurer went through all that trouble just to bring back and show us one of these! Speakin' of which, where did you get your hands on this, mate?
8684 : What's that, you say...? North of Tahrongi Canyon in the Maze of Shakhrami? Well I'll be amazed and shock-whammied!
8685 : Oh!?
8686 : Ah!?
8687 : The pirate king departs his throne To cross the valley of Deathy With tattered flesh and splintered bone He digs till his last breathy.
8688 : His eye carved out by a briny blusterrr His heart pierced by a scorpion's sting Cloaked in his treasure's golden lusterrr Beneath the earth sleeps that pirate king.
8689 : Who'd have thought there were scorpions in the ol' Maze of Shakhrami!? We've gotta go check this out, eh, Gottah!? Oh, and thanks a lot, adventurer.
8690 : Hold your horrrses, Soni-Muni! I've hearrrd that maze is no walk in the park. We don't stand a chance at our current level, so we'd better get some trainin' in firrrst!
8691 : That's what I've been sayin'-wayin' all this time! We could have been out there levelin' up instead of standin' here all day! Arrrgh!!!
8692 : But then we wouldn't have heard the lowdown on the Maze of Shakhrami, would we? Rrright?
8693 : Our chieftainness recently invited Semih Lafihna over to open dialogue, but Semih Lafihna did not take her up on the offerrr.
8694 : That's no rrreal surprise. As far as Semih Lafihna is concerned, her Mithran heritage is of no consequence in her position in Tarutaru society. Why, she may as well have been born a Tarutaru.
8695 : I wonderrr if the chieftainness was going to tell her the truth. But I guess it doesn't matter whetherrr the truth is told or not, as the bad blood will still run thick between them.
8696 : Nothing rrreally would change... But that is a matter which is out of our paws...
8697 : Out of honor for our old chieftainness, we must help in the preparations to crown Semih Lafihna as the new chieftainness.
8698 : I guess you are right... Oh, and what good timing, for there is an adventurerrr passing by now! Why don't we ask [him/her] whetherrr [he/she] can help us out with that task?
8699 : Yes, let's... Excuse me, [sir/miss]... You wouldn't be intending to hunt monsters in the Meriphataud Mountains any time soon, would you?
8700 : If you happen to come upon %, could you please hand it over to us? Oh, and please don't ask why, just do it as a favor for us. Thank you!
8701 : Excuse me [sir/miss]... You wouldn't be intending to hunt monsters in the Meriphataud Mountains any time soon, would you?
8702 : If you happen to come upon %, could you please hand it over to us? Oh, and please don't ask why, just do it as a favor for us. Thank you!
8703 : The % that can be found in the Meriphataud Mountains belong to the Mithran warriors who were felled there twenty years ago. If you find any, please hand them overrr to Gioh Ajihri, thank you.
8704 : Oh good, you found one. Here, I'll give you this as a sign of our appreciation...
8705 : (I just hope it can fit that other gem properly...)
8706 : Deep in the Meriphataud Mountains, there is a bastion of the Yagudo called Castle Oztroja. It is a place where terrific wars were fought.
8707 : Innumerable Mithran fighters were felled there. This % belonged to one of those fallen warriors.
8708 : Twinstones are, as their name suggests, a perrrfect pair of gemstones that are originally found joined as one.
8709 : No otherrr stones can come close to matching them once they are separated. Since they were once a single stone, only their corresponding halves fit perrrfectly back as one.
8710 : Utilizing this very properrrty, twinstones are used as proof of bonds between Mithra back in our homeland.
8711 : Hello again, adventurer. May I again make the same rrrequest as I did before.? I'd like you to search for % in the Meriphataud Mountains.
8712 : I'll pay a good price for any that you find. Once you find one, please bring it back to me as promptly as you can.
8713 : Welcome to the auction house. Do you have any questions about our establishment?
8714 : What do you want to know? What is the auction house? How are auctions run? Are there any fees? Are there any limits? How do you check up on merchandise? How do you remove an item? My Sales Status list is full! Nothing right now.
8715 : Auction houses can be found in all of Vana'diel's major cities. Here adventurers gather to bid on battle spoils, unwanted items, old armor...almost anything.
8716 : Currently, the auction houses in Bastok, San d'Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno all work independently. Therefore, prices differ from city to city.
8717 : Adventurers may use any auction house regardless of nationality.
8718 : The first adventurer to bid at or above the asking price will automatically purchase the product.
8719 : Once put up for auction, merchandise will remain there for a maximum of thirty weeks Vana'diel time (nine-and-a-half days Earth time).
8720 : If merchandise does not sell within this time limit, it will be returned to the seller's current residence.
8721 : Transaction fees are proportional to the amount for which an item is put up on auction. The method of calculating this fee is different for single items and stackable items.
8722 : A transaction fee is collected when any merchandise is put up for auction. This fee is nonrefundable.
8723 : The International Auction House Committee, or IAHC, has declared that a maximum of seven items may be put up for auction at one time.
8724 : However, the IAHC has recently removed the limit to how many items one may purchase.
8725 : A small amount of time is required before new merchandise appears on our bid list.
8726 : Once an item appears on your Sales Status list, it may not immediately appear on the bid list. If you do not see your item on the bid list, try looking again at a later time.
8727 : If you would like to withdraw an item from an auction, you must travel to the auction house, and select Stop Sale from the Sales Status menu.
8728 : To remove an item from your Sales Status list, you must visit an auction counter to acknowledge the sale or return of your merchandise.
8729 : Otherwise, previously sold or returned items will fill up your list and prevent you from selling any more merchandise.
8730 : At any auction counter, open the Sales Status menu and acknowledge the transaction to clear it from the list.
8731 : Press the confirm button to remove any transaction colored yellow (sold) or red (returned).
8732 : Is there anything else you would like to know?
8733 : In the past, many have amassed great wealth through the auction house. I hope you find fortune, too!
8734 : Vana'diel is abuzz with Adventurer Appreciation fever, kupo!
8735 : We moogles have prepared some nice little goodies and gathered lots of top-secret information on adventurer activity, kupo! Let me check my journal for your statistical data...
8736 : Chat Frequency: # Conversations With NPCs: # Parties Joined: # Alliances Joined: #
8737 : Battles Fought: # Number of Times KO'd: # Enemies Defeated: # GM Calls Made: #
8738 : There's your adventuring life in a nutshell!
8739 : There's your adventuring life in a nutshell! And this time, there's an extra-special anniversary present involved! Oh, just be careful you don't accidentally throw it away or anything, because you'll never be able to get another one...ever, kupo!
8740 : Take a look--and to think, you can select # more amazing anniversary items!
8741 : Take a look--and to think, you can select # more amazing anniversary item!
8742 : Which would you like? (# remaining) I need time to think. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
8743 : Ah, I understand. With some many goodies to choose from, it's no surprise that you'd want to think about it a bit more. I'll be here once you've decided, kupo.
8744 : %? (# remaining) Yes. No.
8745 : An excellent choice! I hope you enjoy your brand-new %!
8746 : There's your adventuring life in a nutshell! And because it seems you're so eager to get your hands on some more goodies, I guess I could find it in my heart to spare another...but just for you, kupo!
8747 : You have the choice to either receive your present now, or wait to build up the suspense, kupo!
8748 : If you choose to wait, you might find yourself receiving an even better present, kupo.
8749 : What will you do, kupo? Lemme think, kupo. Gimme my present, kupo! I'll wait, kupo.
8750 : Take all the time you need, and talk to me when you're ready, kupo!

8752 : Kupopopo! A patient one! Let's see how long you can wait before the suspense finally gets to you, kupo!
8753 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
8754 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
8755 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
8756 : Oh, what a cruel, cruel master, kupo!!!
8757 : Thank you, kupo! I...have one more favor to ask. It's almost time for the festival in the moogles' hometown, kupo!
8758 : Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him % as a gift, kupo!
8759 : Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and % would make the perfect present, kupo!
8760 : But I have no idea how to go about finding % or %, kupo... I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...
8761 : Papa Moogle will be entering the archery contest, so I want to bring him % as a gift, kupo!
8762 : Mama Moogle always likes to dress up for the occasion, and % would make the perfect present, kupo!
8763 : But I have no idea how to go about finding % or %, kupo... I can't go home empty-handed, kupo...
8764 : Master! I'm overwhelmed by your kindness, kupo!!!
8765 : I'll bring you a nice present from the moogles' hometown, kupo! I'll be back in a few days, kupo!
8766 : Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!
8767 : Here's your present--a shiny new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 60 items, kupo!
8768 : Looking at that shabby old bed makes me feel homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
8769 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
8770 : Sleeping on that % has made me homesick, kupo. Will my benevolent master give [his/her] moogle some time off to visit with Mama and Papa Moogle, kupo?
8771 : Give your moogle a vacation Sure, kupo!  No, your time is mine!
8772 : Thank you, kupo! I have one more favor to ask... I want to take my family on a picnic, kupo!
8773 : Papa Moogle is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
8774 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!
8775 : But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
8776 : Papa Mog is mad for fishing, so I want to give him %, kupo!
8777 : Mama Moogle would bake a scrumptious mooglepie to take with us, but she'd need %, kupo!
8778 : But...I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get either of these things, kupo... Whatever am I to do, kupo?
8779 : Master! I'm overwhelmed by your kindness, kupo!!!
8780 : I'll bring you a nice present from the moogles' hometown, kupo! I'll be back in a few days, kupo!
8781 : Master! I'm back from my vacation, kupo!

8783 : The capacity of your Mog Safe has increased!
8784 : Master, Master! I have a favor to ask, kupo!
8785 : After resting on the %, I noticed a letter had arrived from some old moogle friends, kupo! Will my magnanimous master give me some time off to go visit my old buddies?
8786 : Give your moogle some time off? Have fun, kupo! No, I am your only friend now!
8787 : Oh, thank you, master! My moogle friends live across the seas, so I have another favor to ask you, kupo!
8788 : The sun beats down mercilessly in the land beyond the west sea, so I need to take % for my friends there, kupo!
8789 : And my other buddies need % for the torrential rains that scour the lands across the east sea, kupo!
8790 : I can't help out my friends if I don't have % and %, kupo...
8791 : I'll be sure to bring you a souvenir from my overseas trip, kupo! See you in a few days, master!
8792 : Master! I'm back from visiting my old moogle friends, kupo!
8793 : We all got together and made you a new Mog Safe, kupo! Now you can store as many as 80 items, kupo!
8794 : I was looking for you. It seems like you've been prrracticing to become a master thief.
8795 : Usually I don't mingle with my competition, but the Tenshodo has put out a call for able-bodied thieves.
8796 : The Tenshodo came to us, so don't even think of turning down their offer.
8797 : Well, I'll see you in Jeuno! As those little wizards say, ta-taru!
8798 : I'll see you at the Tenshodo headquarters in Jeuno.
8799 : The Tenshodo is one of the biggest dealers of merchandise in all of Vana'diel. An adventurer like you has surely heard of it.
8800 : Ahh, Jeuno... How long has it been since I last got my paws into the pockets of those bigwigs?
8801 : You say you've already met up with the rrremains of Atarefaunet's band? Did they tell you anything?
8802 : The guy I talked to was acting like he was so much better than us. He sure rrrubbed my fur the wrrrong way.
8803 : You don't hearrr the name Atarefaunet around these parts that often. I heard that he was pretty famous in the west, though.
8804 : At the time, Atarefaunet's band was loaded with the best of the best. They say that some of the memberrrs were even professional killers, so you had better watch your back.
8805 : <Sigh> The top cat can surrre be difficult at times...
8806 : The weapon you got... What's it like?
8807 : Getting such a fine weapon for such a cakewalk job... It's almost like stealing!
8808 : Ah, I've been looking for you. You know how we got those papers from the Tenshodo and delivered them individually?
8809 : Did you check the signature you got from the Atarefaunet member before giving the papers to Vauderame?
8810 : You know, the last signature on the %? It was a single letter. Did you see it?
8811 : Did you see the signature? Yes. No.
8812 : Are you rrreally a thief? Un-be-liev-able!!
8813 : Let me tell you, then. The signature you got was a V.
8814 : How do I know, you ask?  I can tell what's written on a piece of paper just by touching it.
8815 : Ah! That's my little thief! ...So, what was the letter?
8816 : What was the signature? T A V I...forget.
8817 : Rrright. The signature you got was a V.
8818 : But the prrroblem is, the initial you got doesn't match the initial of the member's name, rrright?
8819 : The signature that I got didn't match either.
8820 : This didn't happen to only you and me. I also asked Esca of San d'Oria and Nbu Latteh of Bastok, and it was the same with them.
8821 : Doesn't all this seem just a little bit fishy? Doesn't it get your whiskers twitching?
8822 : After that task, I did some digging on Atarefaunet's band. It seems that the treasure from the last big heist they pulled off has yet to be found.
8823 : The way I see it, those signatures were some sort of code. To contact the rrremaining members of Atarefaunet's band after all this time just doesn't make sense otherwise.
8824 : Vauderame of the Tenshodo is searching for that treasure. So he threatens Atarefaunet's cutthroats, and collects the code letters...
8825 : I'm gonna collect the signatures from the other six members. Will you help me?
8826 : Help out? Where do I sign? I'll keep my paws out of this one...
8827 : Scaredy-cat! You'll never become a world-famous thief at this rate...
8828 : Are you up for it?
8829 : Okay, take these. I made copies of the % you rrreceived before. Use them in the same way to get signatures from those brrrigands.
8830 : Huh? What should you say? I'm sure you'll think of something...
8831 : The last obstacle is finding the members' hideouts... At the moment, we know the location of two of the bandits, so why don't you go pay them a visit?
8832 : We tailed them to their hideouts. Herrre, I wrote the locations down for you.
8833 : If the top cat says something is fishy, you better believe it!
8834 : First things first! Get ahold of those signatures. Oh, and by the way, don't even think of drrropping this little errand halfway through...
8835 : The location of the hideouts are wrrritten on the %, right?
8836 : Find the hideouts, and get those signatures. Go on, shoo!
8837 : From what I saw, to meet with the member in the Goblin store in Jeuno, you have to try your hand at a game of chance.
8838 : Esca was furrrious at being forced to play over and over just because of her bad luck. Are you feeling lucky?
8839 : Just a minute! I completely forgot. To climb the towerrr in Sauromugue Champaign, you need to have %.
8840 : But even if you have one, you won't be getting up that tower if you're a fat cat!
8841 : Did you get those signatures? I have the last two rrright here.
8842 : Okay, eight letters... Let's put them together... V, Z, A, N, A, T, A, I...
8843 : Hmm... If I put this here... Umm...
8844 : Huh? You still here? Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.
8845 : Huh? You still here? Here, take your loot and scoot. I'll let you know when I figure this out. Come and see me later.
8846 : We had our troubles, too. The member I went after told me, Thieves need to be fleet on their feet. I had to chase that villain around for hourrrs.
8847 : Ow, I hurt... What use is beauty in thieving? My m-muscles are so sore!
8848 : I finally figured out the code. All those letters we got from the Atarefaunet band...I know what they mean.
8849 : When I rrrearranged the order of the letters, I came out with Tavnazia.
8850 : Tavnazia... In other words, the Tavnazian Marquisate. A nation to the west that was obliterated by the beastmen in the Great War.
8851 : Tavnazia pledged allegiance to San d'Oria and was ruled by Marquis Altedour. But after some investigation, I discovered some slightly more interesting facts.
8852 : Just before the nation was swarmed under by the beastmen, the knights of Tavnazia carried away the rrroyal treasure. However, the knights themselves were attacked by brigands and the treasure was stolen.
8853 : If you listen to the old thieves, they'll tell you it was the work of the Atarefaunet band. But since the leader of the band died, the truth is anybody's guess.
8854 : Isn't this exciting? The rrremaining members of the Atarefaunet band must hold the key to the location of the Tavnazian royal treasure!
8855 : Vauderame of the Tenshodo must be arranging a deal with them to get his greedy hands on the goods.
8856 : Now that I know his plans, I'll have to work my way into his circle and get my paws in the pie, too.
8857 : Don't rrrush into anything just yet. There's something wrong. Vauderame hasn't made a move yet.
8858 : If he had made some sort of deal with the brigands, you would think they would get together somewhere first, then head off to get the treasure.
8859 : Vauderame is a man of many secrets.
8860 : Nobody really knows his background, and he loses us every time we try to tail him. There's something dangerous about that man.
8861 : ...Hmm. A very mysterious character, indeed. Speaking of mysteries, there's one thing that I don't quite understand.
8862 : Why did the brigands send the word Tavnazia to Vauderame?
8863 : Surely he would have already known about the Tavnazian royal treasure before planning to meet with them.
8864 : ...That's it!
8865 : %, I want you to go and ask these two thieves a question.
8866 : The person who wrote the papers from the Tenshodo, the name at the top...what was wrrritten there?
8867 : Quickly now! There's no time!
8868 : We'll deal with the rest, so hurry! Be on your way!
8869 : A nation with allegiance to San d'Oria, ruled by Marquis Altedour... It's supposed to lie farrr to the west of here...
8870 : Anyway, let's put the geography lesson aside and go pull the rrrug out from under the Tenshodo! Things have started to get interesting...
8871 : Vauderame is a very mysterrrious character. He's been in the Tenshodo for ten years, quietly building up his current standing.
8872 : I get the sense that he's made a deliberrrate effort to rrreach a position that allows him to move freely while keeping a low profile.
8873 : Did you get the information I asked for? Okay, let's put it all together and see what we have.
8874 : You've probably already noticed, but the name of the person who wrrrote the papers is different on each one. However, the contents are all exactly the same. A little odd, don't you think?
8875 : This must have some other meaning. If we lay out the letters that we both discovered, we have... D, L, E, L, O, R, E.
8876 : ...What was the letter you had for the papers you delivered originally?
8877 : What was the signature? M Q Blank I forget
8878 : Exactly. Your papers had a blank area where the signature should have been. So, rrrearranging the seven letters, we get...
8879 : If you keep playing the fool, I may have to bite you. Your papers had a blank area where the signature should have been. So, rrrearranging the seven letters, we get...
8880 : Ordelle!
8881 : We must hurry to Ordelle's Caves!
8882 : Vauderame used us to tell the bandits to gather at Ordelle's Caves.
8883 : We must hurry to Ordelle's Caves!
8884 : Vauderame used us to tell the bandits to gather at Ordelle's Caves.
8885 : What's all the fuss about? You've brrroken the code!? Terrrific!
8886 : Atarefaunet's band is rumored to contain prrrofessional killers, so keep on your toes and keep out of sight. They're a dangerrrous bunch.
8887 : It's great that we found the treasure... But I get the feeling there's something important I'm forgetting... What could it be...? Grrr, that's rrreally gonna annoy me...
8888 : Thanks for looking after the top cat. If something happened to her, we'd just go back to being a couple of strrrays.
8889 : When I checked at the Tenshodo, Vauderame was nowhere to be found. It's like he just popped out of existence...
8890 : So you have come, my fellow ranger. I thank the winds for your safe return.
8891 : I have a task for you.  It is said that adventurers follow the winds, traveling far and wide across Vana'diel.
8892 : I wish for you to meet with Sibyl Guard Semih Lafihna with all haste. Give her this. She should rrreturn here with you.
8893 : Currently, Semih Lafihna is conducting an investigation in a place called Ranguemont Pass, located on the western continent.
8894 : There is little time. ...The blessing of the winds go with you.
8895 : Find Semih Lafihna and give her the earring. She should rrreturn here with you.
8896 : Currently, Semih Lafihna is conducting an investigation in a place called Ranguemont Pass, located on the western continent. May the winds protect and guide you, adventurer.
8897 : A Mithran Tracker from the homeland has arrived.
8898 : It's been decades since... The sin will not be forgiven. Even if what happened was destiny...
8899 : For Mithra, there are three laws that are inviolate.
8900 : The Mithran Tracker is the one who brings judgment for those sins. The family who perpetrated the sin is extinguished from the land, from the sky, from time itself.
8901 : I see you were able to find Semih Lafihna...
8902 : ...Just a moment... That prrresence...
8903 : Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I apologize for this interruption.
8904 : ...You are the Mithran Tracker, I prrresume?
8905 : If your visit concerns the sinner's daughter, we are prrresently focusing all our efforts on finding the one who can confirm her passing.
8906 : Attempt to rrreturn the past to dust if you will, but it will avail you naught. Dust is swept up by the wind, its scent carried on. The scent of my quarry.
8907 : I will tell you once morrre. I have no rrreason to hide the past. The bearer of the bow does not oppose the trrruth.
8908 : Be that as it may, the loss of the Bow of Light does not sit well with me.
8909 : I will speak bluntly. Perih Vashai, I believe you strrruck some kind of deal with the sinner.
8910 : Your daughter's age was close to that of the sinner's. Is it possible you sympathized with their plight?
8911 : ......
8912 : As I'm sure you are well aware, I won't be leaving this land until I have hunted down the sinner. I will enlighten the people of the Outlands on the evils of hiding sin.
8913 : Chieftainness Perih Vashai!
8914 : The Mithra I just saw... She was the Mithran Tracker from the homeland, wasn't she?
8915 : Yes, but do not seek to hinder her. She is here to see justice done, and serves nature as we do.
8916 : I want you to give me a clear answer. I come as a keeper of the peace of Windurst. Is the daughter of the sinner really dead?
8917 : Do you doubt it...? I see, you were questioned by the Tracker.
8918 : Yes, she followed me to Jugner Forest. It seems the sinner carries a scent that we cannot detect.
8919 : But I was not the daughter the Tracker was seeking. Did you send the earring out of concern for me? If so, your fears appear to be unfounded.
8920 : ......
8921 : I will take this opportunity to tell you, even if you are found to be guilty, I have no intention of becoming the next Chieftainness of Windurst.
8922 : However, I also have little desirrre to aid that Mithran Tracker in her hunt. I have no interest in the mysterrries of the past. The future is all that concerns me now.
8923 : %. You see us in troubled times. On occasion, even the Mithra fight amongst themselves.
8924 : I feel that your talents will become necessary before this struggle comes to an end. Will you promise to lend us your strrrength in our time of need?
8925 : Take this as a symbol of your pledge. May the path cleared by the wind always lie before you.
8926 : %. You see us in troubled times. On occasion, even the Mithra fight amongst themselves.
8927 : I feel that your talents will become necessary before this struggle comes to an end. Will you promise to lend us your strrrength in our time of need?
8928 : The Mithran Tracker has come from the homeland of our people.
8929 : There was another time, twenty years ago, when a Mithran Tracker arrived from across the seas. However, that was not the same Mithra that was here a moment ago.
8930 : For Mithra, there are three laws that are inviolate.
8931 : No matter how far we roam from the homeland, we cannot escape these laws. For those who break the laws of nature, only oblivion awaits.
8932 : Good luck, [citizen/comrade]. I will bestow upon you your nation's Signet.
8933 : I cannot help you. You should go find a guard from your own country.
8934 : I cannot accept crystals from someone whose rank is still 1. I advise you to either keep them until your reach rank 2, or to use them in craftwork.
8935 : Since we are allied with San d'Oria...
8936 : Since we are allied with Bastok...
8937 : Since we are allied with Windurst...
8938 : I am sorry. I am too busy with other matters to be speaking with you.
8939 : Ah, you have brought us supplies. These will help us indeed. I thank you.
8940 : Hmm... These supplies you have brought us are too old to be of any use. We will dispose of them promptly. I do commend you for your effort. May you succeed next time.
8941 : You've earned conquest points!
8942 : You've received your nation's Signet. You are now taking part in your nation's conquest campaign!
8943 : I am , a Temple Knight. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing San d'Oria's conquest campaign.
8944 : I am , an Iron Musketeer. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Bastok's conquest campaign.
8945 : I am , a War Warlock. I am one of the guards charged with overseeing Windurst's conquest campaign.
8946 : What is your business? Would you cast Signet on me? I want to spend my conquest points. [I want to join the Expeditionary Force./Teleport me to the E.F. area.] I want to quit the E.F./change my E.F. I want to go on a supplies quest. I have some questions... Nothing, sorry to bother you.
8947 : What do you wish to know about? Nothing. Conquests. Conquest results. Donating crystals. Conquest points. The effects of controlling regions. Regions controlled by other nations. Regions under beastman control.
8948 : All three nations are striving daily to put more regions under their control. This is what we call conquests. You can take part in it and serve your country by defeating enemies while you have Signet cast on you.
8949 : Each region comprises several areas, and the nation that rids those areas of the most monsters gains control of the region.
8950 : Nations receive goods and resources from regions under their control.
8951 : So, the more regions we control, the richer our nation becomes.
8952 : Border guards are also placed in outposts within regions under our control. They are there to cast Signet on adventurers like yourself.
8953 : Once you have your nation's Signet, you will be able to acquire crystals from enemies you defeat.
8954 : Not only that, but you will also receive conquest points. You get more conquest points if you defeat enemies in regions that are not under your nation's control. These points can be used to purchase items from guards like myself.
8955 : So you see...conquests benefit nations and adventurers alike. We expect you to do your best to serve your country.
8956 : You can see the current state of conquests by selecting Region Info from the main menu. Conquest results in all regions are regularly recalculated, so you may want to check them from time to time.
8957 : Shops in our city will be selling different items according to our conquest rank. The Troupe Valeriano will also visit the nation that finishes first and bring a little joy to its citizens.
8958 : You can donate crystals to your nation once you achieve rank 2. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
8959 : We would like you to donate crystals to your nation from now on. Just trade them to guards like myself, and we will ensure they are sent to the proper place.
8960 : You can acquire crystals by defeating enemies while you have your nation's Signet. Having Signet cast on you is also the only way of taking part in conquests.
8961 : Rank points will be awarded to you for each crystal you donate, and you may be offered new missions as your rank goes up.
8962 : You also receive rank points for completing missions. Complete missions and take part in conquests to raise your rank and serve your country.
8963 : You are awarded conquest points when you defeat monsters while you are taking part in conquests. Select "Region Info" from the menu to check your current number of conquest points.
8964 : You can purchase items from guards like myself with your conquest points, but be warned that the number of points you spend will be subtracted from your current total.
8965 : When conquest results are announced, you will be told which country controls the region you are in at that time. Sometimes regions may become neutral, or beastmen may even gain control of regions.
8966 : If we gain control of a region, border guards will be placed at its outposts to help adventurers like you.
8967 : Merchants will also be placed there, and goods from that region will find their way to the local shops here.
8968 : Gaining control of regions is the basic principle behind conquests. We need each of you to do your best, and bring our nation to the top of the ranks.
8969 : Of course, sometimes we lose regions to other nations...so we must try to take them back before the next conquest results are announced.
8970 : As an incentive, we will award you with more conquest points for defeating monsters in those regions.
8971 : But if we are allied with another nation, you will only be awarded the regular rate for defeating monsters in our allies' regions. On the other hand, we will award you with more points for fighting in the top-ranked nation's regions.
8972 : Our paramount concern lies in the beastmen gaining control of our regions. If too many of us are defeated in a region, the beastmen will gain control of it.
8973 : If this happens, not only is it a great blow to our pride, but you will be unable to acquire any crystals in that region.
8974 : The beastmen are a menace to all nations. If they rise to power, we must all unite and drive those vile creatures from that region.
8975 : We need you to bring supplies to the outpost border guards who are placed in regions under our control.
8976 : There is one outpost in each region. Select Region Info from the menu, and look for the areas with a small flag mark on the map. That is where they are.
8977 : Here are the supplies. Just give them to the guard at the outpost and your mission will be complete. Now, choose which outpost you want to go to. We give different rewards for each region, so choose carefully.
8978 : Where do you wish to take the supplies?      The Ronfaure Region.[/ (Done)] The Zulkheim Region.[/ (Done)] The Norvallen Region.[/ (Done)] The Gustaberg Region.[/ (Done)] The Derfland Region.[/ (Done)] The Sarutabaruta Region.[/ (Done)] The Kolshushu Region.[/ (Done)] The Aragoneu Region.[/ (Done)] The Fauregandi Region.[/ (Done)] The Valdeaunia Region.[/ (Done)] Qufim Island.[/ (Done)] The Li'Telor Region.[/ (Done)] The Kuzotz Region.[/ (Done)] The Vollbow Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Lowlands Region.[/ (Done)] The Elshimo Uplands Region.[/ (Done)] Tu'Lia.[/ (Done)]  The Tavnazian Archipelago.[/ (Done)]        Cancel.

9020 : Word has it that the entire set of mog tablets has been recovered.  Oh, happy day! In honor of the occasion, I can teleport you to your home country free of charge.
9021 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough gil.
9022 : I am terribly sorry, but it seems as if you do not have enough conquest points.
9023 : However, due to your home country's lack of influence in the region, this is the only transaction I am authorized to perform with you at the moment.
9024 : I am looking forward to doing business with you again in the future!
9025 : Thank you. This will increase your nation's region points by a small amount. If you have anything else, by all means, trade them to me.

9039 : We are currently conducting an international exchange campaign. You may spend your conquest points to purchase items from foreign guards.

9041 : Adventurers from nations that are ranked higher than ours in the conquest race may purchase items from us, but at a higher rate.
9042 : You cannot currently purchase this item. Please choose another.
9043 : Currently our nation is dispatching Expeditionary Forces across Vana'diel, and requests the participation of brave adventurers such as yourself.

9048 : Your party doesn't have enough members, or some of the members are not in this area. Gather all those who are participating and return here.
9049 : One of your party members is not a citizen of this country. We do not allow any foreign participants in the E.F.
9050 : One of your party members has not achieved rank level 3. We cannot reveal any of our tactical strategies to those who have not shown their loyalty to our country.
9051 : One of your party members is below level #. For the safety of the adventurer and those accompanying him or her, we cannot allow anyone below the limit to participate in the E.F.
9052 : I see that you are ready. I grant you permission to join the current Expeditionary Force. When you are ready to teleport to the outpost, talk to me once more.
9053 : Are you ready to be teleported to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Remember that party members who have not been granted permission to attend the E.F. will be left behind.
9054 : Teleport to [Ronfaure/Zulkheim/Norvallen/Gustaberg/Derfland/Sarutabaruta/Kolshushu/Aragoneu/Fauregandi/Valdeaunia/Qufim/Li'Telor/Kuzotz/Vollbow/The Elshimo Lowlands/The Elshimo Uplands]? Ready! Wait just a minute...

9056 : Quit the E.F.? Yes. Change locations. No.
9057 : Are you sure?
9058 : Really quit the E.F.? Yes. No.
9059 : I see. If you ever wish to participate in the future, I will be waiting here to take your application.
9060 : Your EF Badge vanishes!
9061 : Katsu-yaku pointos : #!
9062 : This % is no longer valid. We will dispose of it here.
9063 : Your invalid ensignias have been disposed of.
9064 : Welcome back from the expedition. Our nation was successful in its campaign. Let me give you your reward.
9065 : You received # conquest points!
9066 : When participating in an Expeditionary Force, concentrate your efforts on fighting foes that give you the most experience points. And don't forget to confiscate the contents of any beastman treasure chest you happen to come upon.
9067 : I will now hand you your insignia. Be sure to read the inscription on the back before you begin your duties. Once Signet has been bestowed upon you, prepare to be teleported.
9068 : You could not be teleported. Ask me again, please.
9069 : The conquest results are currently being tallied. Come back later.
9070 : You have received permission to join the Expeditionary Forces!
9071 : Currently we rank first in Vana'diel's conquest, but that must not be taken for granted. We must continue our fight to remain on top.
9072 : We had first place in our hands, but we let it slip away. If we want to be ranked first in Vana'diel, each and every one of us must do their part. I look forward to hearing of your achievements.
9073 : Our country has fallen to third in the conquest of Vana'diel. We must step up our efforts to improve the situation.
9074 : You must fight in battles that gain high levels of experience. This is the only way we can bring areas under our country's control.
9075 : Currently, our country is the dominant force in this region. If we can maintain this level, control of this area will be ours.
9076 : Currently, our country is a major force in this region. However, we cannot take this for granted. If we let down our guard, we will surely lose control of the area!
9077 : Currently, our country has only minor influence in this region. We're counting on you to get us out of this hole we've dug ourselves into.
9078 : Currently, our country's influence in this area is minimal. If we do not act quickly, control of this region will certainly be taken by a rival country.
9079 : Take care when passing through, as this area is currently overrun with beastmen! Something must be done, or the enemy will have control of the entire region.
9080 : Your inventory is full. You could not accept the %.
9081 : You already possess a gate glyph. You cannot hold any more.
9082 : I am Jeunoan Ducal Guard, . My duty is to support the conquest efforts of Windurst, San d'Oria, and Bastok.
9272 : PAUSE
9274 : Have the winds sent you to me once more...?
9275 : I have just had word that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.
9276 : Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.
9277 : You have your task. The blessing of the winds upon you.
9278 : I have learned that one who knows of the fate of the sinner's daughter can be found in the Blacksmiths' Guild of Mhaura.
9279 : Upon hearing this, the Mithran Tracker immediately set off on her way. I wish for you to also travel to Mhaura and meet with this perrrson.
9280 : Twenty years prrrevious, there was a sinner who escaped from her prrrison and fled to this continent.
9281 : There are few Mithra in Windurst who know of her tale. It is a low point in our historrry, and not a thing that is often spoke of...
9282 : There is little point in asking those of us who rrremember. We do not talk about it willingly.
9283 : We are of the trrribe to the south. The events that trrranspired among us at that time are taboo. That is all I can tell you.
9284 : You have rrreturned. ...And the Mithran Tracker with you.
9285 : After learning the location of the daughter's final rrresting place, we trrraveled to a place known as the Eldieme Necropolis.
9286 : There, we found %. Piecing togetherrr everything I have heard, I believe it must belong to the sinner's daughter.
9287 : However, one problem rrremains. Where is the other half of the stone? Where is the grrrave of the mother?
9288 : We were unable to discover the mother's body.
9289 : Since she was held captive in the prison of Castle Oztroja, her rrremains should lie there still.
9290 : It is said that the King of Oztroja forces prrrisoners to fight his Yagudo in a hall on the highest level of the castle. The bodies of the fallen are then supposedly thrrrown into a large pond.
9291 : If you search the pond thorrroughly, you may find what you are looking for...
9292 : Well, I will leave this task to you. Rrreturn here as soon as you find the %.
9293 : I must apologize, adventurer. I would like to send a parrrty of warriors to aid you, but we do not have permission from Heavens Tower to enter Castle Oztroja.
9294 : The blessing of the earth upon you.
9295 : In the time of the Great War, the warriors held in Oztroja were forced to fight with Yagudo in a hall on the castle's highest floor.
9296 : The fallen warriors were then thrrrown into a large pond on the upper levels.
9297 : I believe the % that fits with the % of Syu Befrathi can be found there... However, the talents of a ranger will be needed to discover it.
9298 : You found it... Yes, it's a perrrfect match with Syu Befrathi's %.
9299 : I'm impressed. Tales of mighty adventurers are often little more than exaggerated rumor.
9300 : However, while this adventurer was perrrforming [his/her] task, I was busy talking with an important witness.
9301 : This witness claims that the use of a shining bow was rrresponsible for your loss of sight.
9302 : The witness also mentioned that the prisoners of Oztroja were saved by a bow that loosed arrows of light so dazzling, the Yagudo were struck blind. This could only describe the Bow of Light.
9303 : It is time for the truth to be known. You are concealing the Bow of Light, aren't you? Have you been seduced by its powerrr, Perih Vashai?
9304 : Even for one who is blind, surely you can see this has gone on long enough!
9305 : ......
9306 : Very well. It is said that you are not one to run and hide.
9307 : I am in no hurry. Let us leave it at this for now.
9308 : And this, adventurer, I give to you. May you always be on the side of justice.
9309 : ...The Bow of Light. Thirty years have passed since its creation. And all it has brought us is death and misfortune.
9310 : This all started when we came to this continent. The elders called this place the Forbidden Land, and were opposed to the crossing. It all started here...
9311 : We Mithra receive the blessing of the earth in creating the chieftainness's bow.
9312 : Chieftainness Perih Vashai received the blessing of this land when she made the Azure Bow.
9313 : The Bow of Light belongs to the Fire Tribe of the south. The arrows fired from that bow are said to be so powerrrful and so destrrructive, no enemy can stand before them.
9314 : But no matter how powerrrful a weapon is, our chieftainness would not take up that bow. Its use would contrrradict the code of the ranger.
9315 : ...? The one who follows you here...
9316 : Perih Vashai. There is something I wish to ask you. Please give me an answer.
9317 : ...And what might that be, Semih Lafihna? You wish to ask me about the lost Bow of Light?
9318 : No, not that. It's about my past...
9319 : I rrrealized something with all this talk of the Bow of Light. The Sibyl Guards, every one of us, were prisoners in Oztroja twenty years ago.
9320 : I listened to everyone's stories, and they all have memories of being saved by that bow. But for some reason, I have no recollection of it...
9321 : I was one of those prisoners as well, wasn't I? I was taken in by Heavens Tower to keep the secrets of the Bow of Light hidden from the world.
9322 : Or was there some other reason that only affected me? I don't know how you managed to erase the scent of sin from me, but I must be the sinner's...
9323 : Semih Lafihna, I swear on the Azure Bow. You are not the sinner's daughter.
9324 : Then why? The Mithran Tracker assured me there was no record of my parents. And there's one thing I dimly rrrecall...
9325 : At the time of the Great War, I rrremember my % was switched with another. My past...why...?
9326 : Why doesn't anybody know about my past?
9327 : I meant to tell you after all this was over, but I see I have no choice.
9328 : Go to Mhaura and meet with Koh Lenbalalako.
9329 : If you take the % I entrrrusted to this adventurer, she will talk with you.
9330 : Once Semih Lafihna meets with Koh Lenbalalako of Mhaura, she will understand.
9331 : I would like you to follow her to Mhaura. She will need your strrrength to help bring an end to this tale.
9332 : The chieftainness wishes Semih Lafihna to see the trrruth with her own eyes.
9333 : Everything becomes clear when you choose to see of your own free will. Will represents the eye of the spirit. As a ranger, the vision of your spirit must not become clouded...
9334 : The Mithran Tracker is unwavering in her search for the Bow of Light.
9335 : But, no matter how she tries to sway us, we will not betrrray our chieftainness. We have sworn to obey the chieftainness in all things.
9336 : So, you will follow Semih and trrravel to the Northland?
9337 : The Northlands are a place of death that we Mithra avoid above all others. It is a land that rrrobs us of the blessing and grace of nature. May the winds watch over you.
9338 : I now have the Bow of Light in my possession. The magicite that gave this bow its cursed power has been rrreturned to the land where it belongs.
9339 : I wish to express my heartfelt grrratitude to you, Semih Lafihna, for rrretrieving it from the wilds of the Northlands.
9340 : It was not I who found the bow. That honor belongs to the adventurer %.
9341 : I see. I have much to thank you for.
9342 : Ah, but words of thanks have little value to an adventurer, do they? Instead, I will give you these.
9343 : It is %. Please take them as a symbol of my rrrespect for your skill as a ranger.
9344 : And so, Chieftainness Perih Vashai, I leave this land behind me to begin my next hunt.
9345 : ...And just like that, she leaves...
9346 : ...Hmmm, the Tracker's real task here was most likely the destruction of the Bow of Light.
9347 : And not catching the sinner?
9348 : I don't know for certain, but the homeland was definitely more concerned with the Bow of Light than the sinner's daughter.
9349 : In that case, the magicite's power must truly be dreadful.
9350 : ...... Magicite rrresembles crystals. Or rather, the power contained in magicite is similar to, or perhaps greater than, that contained in crystals.
9351 : But both are unnatural creations. The powerrr of magicite is an ominous, cursed energy. It is a manifestation of evil that we cannot tolerrrate.
9352 : The Chieftainness of the Fire Tribe, Nhev Befrathi, knew this. And after seeing the bow for ourselves, the Mithran Tracker and I knew it too.
9353 : That crystal calls to those of Mithran blood. It awakens feelings of envy, of jealousy. It darkens the nature of the heart.
9354 : Nhev Befrathi and her daughter, however, had the strength to rrresist its influence. Even though they used the bow, the light in their hearts rrremained.
9355 : ...I understand now. Perih Vashai, you lost the light when you drew back the string of that cursed weapon.
9356 : Yes. I saw the power of that bow and closed my eyes to it.
9357 : You desire nothing in a world where you see nothing. There is nothing to be afraid of.
9358 : ...... I rrrespect you, Perih Vashai. I don't know if I could have done the same in your place.
9359 : But for that, I twisted the path you were to walk. To save Syu Befrathi, I erased the existence of my own daughter...
9360 : ......
9361 : ...Perih Vashai. I have no feelings of hate towards you. It is my duty to listen to the voice of naturrre.
9362 : I will come to see you again. Until then, may the wind guide your footsteps.
9363 : Occasionally, you too should try seeing the world through closed eyes.
9364 : What is there, in your inner world? ...Who do you see?
9365 : All of the children taken in by Heavens Tower lost their mothers. Under normal circumstances, they would be sent to our homeland to be cared for by other Mithra.
9366 : You rrrealize why they were not sent to the homeland, don't you? The chieftainness wished to watch over the growth of her child, Semih Lafihna...Even if it meant being despised...
9367 : We know what the chieftainness felt when she gave up her child for the sake of rrreturning the Bow of Light to its rrrightful place.
9368 : She had to abandon her rrrole as a mother in order to fulfil her duties as a chieftainness, and as a ranger. I wonder if Semih Lafihna understands this?
9369 : Ho there, adventurer. Have you come to take on the search for the %?
9370 : There's actually no longer a need for it... But we should honor the brave warriors who brought about this time of peace.
9371 : Well, if you find any, bring them here the same as usual.
9372 : Ah, you've arrived. With your help, Semih Lafihna has become a little more rrreceptive to the words of the chieftainness.
9373 : Now we have some peace around here. Especially since the Mithran Tracker has returned home convinced of the fate of the sinner's daughter.
9374 : Hmmm? You also went to Eldieme Necropolis to confirm her death?
9375 : Heh-heh-heh. That wasn't the rrremains of the daughter. It was the final rrresting place of her mother, Nhev Befrathi.
9376 : We had another adventurer like you find a set of ownerless-earrings. We placed them in the necropolis long before you got there.
9377 : Chieftainness Perih Vashai had predicted that another Mithran Tracker would show up eventually.
9378 : But if you do happen to find any % in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them here. I'll buy them from you.
9379 : They belonged to the Mithran warriors responsible for bringing about this time of peace. They should be properly honored.
9380 : If you ever find any % in the Meriphataud Mountains, bring them back here. I will buy them from you to honor the fallen.
9381 : We found many earrings but had a terrible time trying to find the missing halves...I thought furrr was going to fly.
9382 : I wonder if the Mithran Tracker really believes that the daughter is dead... We can't let our guarrrd down yet.
9383 : You found some? Here, take this with my thanks.
9384 : Hello, adventurer. If you find any %, bring them here to me.
9385 : Let us honor the Mithran warriors who fell in the Meriphataud Mountains.
9386 : Captain Rakoh Buuma was sooo angrrry, y'know? She was saying something like, Lately the guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off! Slacking off completely!...I think.
9387 : Now that the airship route to the southern continent has been reopened, there might be some trrrouble amongst the Mithra of Windurst...I think. ...Gotta stay alert, y'know?
9388 : Captain Rakoh Buuma has been fuming that the guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off, slacking off completely!
9389 : I wonderrr if she found out about me fishing during patrol duty? I'm not gonna fish anymorrre! I'm gonna do my job properly!
9390 : W-we were r-reprimanded by Captain Rakoh Buuma. She was growling that we guards of Windurst Woods have rrreally been slacking off... Slacking off completely, she said!
9391 : I, erm, I think she was angry b-because I, I don'taru get along with Mithra very well... M-maybe I sh-should try to invite Sola Jaab along on a fishing trip s-sometime.
9392 : Ajido-Marujido... Minister of the Orastery and head of the Mage Academy. This mission has been issued by him.
9393 : It says here that you should head to the Orastery right away. There's nothing written about the nature of the mission, but...it's a direct order from the ministerrr. You should hurry along.
9394 : ...This is a mission ordered by Ajido-Marujido, head of the Mage Academy. He wants you to head to the Orastery rrright away.
9395 : The mission parameters are strictly confidential... I wonder what he'll ask of you?
9396 : Where did she hear about it, I wonder...? Semih Lafihna, she like, totally wanted to know everything about this mission from Ajido-Marujido.
9397 : She seemed kinda on edge, y'know? Even Captain Buuma, who like, totally hates Semih, was like, Oh, okay, this is what the mission is about,...or something like that.
9398 : Things are so easygoing herrre lately. It's nice to have some peace in Windurst for a change.
9399 : Up until now there have been so many heart-stopping incidents. Farrr too many. We should try and preserve this peace for a while.
9400 : S-speaking of Minister Ajido-Marujido, I, I heard Minister Tosuka-Porika of the Optistery c-calling him a thiefy-wief.
9401 : I, I mean, they've never been the besty-westy of friends, but I w-wonder what else could have h-happened? It gives me b-butterflies in my tummy-wummy.
9402 : ...... I mustaru help my brother...! I havetaru be strong...!
9403 : You have been summoned to Heavens Tower by order of the Star Sibyl.
9404 : Could this be rrrelated to the arrest of Minister Ajido-Marujido by the Sibyl Guards? You will probably be interrogated on the details of your previous mission. Make haste to Heavens Tower.
9405 : You have been summoned to Heavens Tower by order of the Star Sibyl.
9406 : ...Ah yes, if you happen to meet with Semih Lafihna, tell her this: No matter what the Star Sibyl says, we Mithra will follow the path of our beliefs.
9407 : The D-Dark D-Dungeon is the w-worst punishment that a criminal can g-getaru.
9408 : There's n-no leaving the Dark Dungeon until you d-die. H-h-h-how h-h-h-horrible!
9409 : What an uproarrr! There's been anotherrr incident!
9410 : ...But being a Tarutaru problem, it's probably nothing to get worked up about. He'll just get a slap on the wrist and a week in jail or something similarrr, I would think.
9411 : I always thought Heavens Tower just did, y'know, prophecies and stuff. But the Star Sibyl rrreally, like, lays down the law when she has to.
9412 : What did the Orastery minister get up to, anyway? I mean, what's under that crumbly old tower, like, y'know?
9413 : Now that the Sibyl Guards are checking all the missions, it really gets my hackles up.
9414 : Well, leaving all that aside, your next mission comes from the Optistery. They are rrrequesting assistance with tidying up the book vault.
9415 : The Optistery must have been happy with your past performance to ask for you by name.
9416 : Go to the Optistery and talk to the minister for the details of your mission.
9417 : ...Oh, it's a little late, but... Congratulations on rrreaching rrrank seven.
9418 : I, I, I don't like to talk aboutaru people this way, b-b-but please take c-c-care around the Sibyl Guards.
9419 : I, I, I think they're k-k-k-eeping a close eye on y-y-you. W-w-watch your back on the streets at n-n-night...
9420 : I despise cleaning, but I love those frog books.
9421 : If I were a rank seven adventurerrr being offered this mission... Rrr, what a dilemma!
9422 : You know the Minister of the Manustery...Miss Apururu? She doesn't like, y'know, smile as much as she used to.
9423 : Even when she does smile, it's like, not rrreally a smile, y'know? I'm a girrrl, too. I know these things... I think.
9424 : This is a mission issued by the Rrrhinostery.
9425 : The Rrrhinostery wishes your help in a certain matter. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.
9426 : I have a feeling something bad has happened. I hope you're able to straighten things out for them.
9427 : This mission entails helping out the Rrrhinostery. Speak with the rrresearcher Leepe-Hoppe for the full details. He can be found on the second floor of the Rrrhinostery.
9428 : The Sibyl Guards had nothing to say about this mission. Does this mean the Rrrhinostery is considered above suspicion? Or does it mean that something more sinister already has their full attention?
9429 : I, I, I've heard that Minister R-R-Rukususu of the R-R-Rhinostery is investigating a-a-ancient ruins in the Northlands.
9430 : S-S-She is looking into things like, erm...the reason why the Northlands have towers similar to the ones found in S-S-Sarutabaruta. Wh-wh-why would that be, I wonder?
9431 : We Mithra came to Windurst from a village far to the south.
9432 : ...I don't really rememberrr much about it, though. Just that it was always hot.
9433 : Have you ever been to the southern continent? There are lots of, like, rrreally rrrare plants and stuff... I think.
9434 : We use those plants to make, y'know, medicine and weapons and stuff like that. We Mithra are, like, children of nature, y'know?
9435 : Before I explain your mission, I wish to congratulate you.
9436 : Well done on rrreaching rrrank eight. There aren't many people who can make it this far.
9437 : Rrright, down to brass tacks. Your next mission is from the Aurastery. You can get the details from the teachers at the School of Magic.
9438 : The School of Magic is another name for the Aurastery. The teachers there will explain your mission objectives.
9439 : Rrrecently, there have been rrrumors of feral Cardians gathering at the magic towers of the Horutoto Ruins. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
9440 : D-d-did you know that they h-h-have lots of m-m-magical dolls at the Aurastery?
9441 : O-o-originally there were only a f-f-few types, but Professor Koru-Moru has re-re-remodeled them for various tasks.
9442 : Let me see... ...You have [50/60/70/80/90/100] points!
9443 : What do I mean, [50/60/70/80/90/100] points? Ah, now that would be telling!
9444 : F...f...froggies!
9445 : Meow!
9446 : The Principal of the School of Magic is Professor Koru-Moru, y'know? But, like, a few years back, there was a different guy doing the job, y'know?
9447 : What's really weird is that you don't hear anything about that guy. Tarutaru are, like, totally into their rumors, so I thought it was kinda strange.
9448 : This mission has not been officially approved. However, all of the gatehouse guards have agreed to ask you to perform this task.
9449 : Go to the Manustery and assist Minister Apururu. Those are your orders.
9450 : I don't think I need to tell you this, but don't tell anyone about this mission. Be especially careful of that Semih Lafihna. She has a habit of picking up on rrrumors from the most unlikely places.
9451 : Don't make me rrrepeat myself. Head to the Manustery and talk with Minister Apururu. This is your mission.
9452 : Keep your orders to yourself, and be especially careful that Semih Lafihna doesn't get wind of what you're doing.
9453 : Th-th-this is not a b-b-betrayal of the S-S-Star Sibyl.
9454 : W-w-we just want to h-h-help Minister Apururu. The Orastery needs your h-h-help too.
9455 : Things are getting exciting now! All the guards arrre in on this secret together!
9456 : I can hardly contain myself! But I won't let on to anyone. I'll just flick my tail and keep it in.
9457 : Miiri-Wohri is, like, totally freaked about this mission.
9458 : But even if we, like, y'know, get found out and stuff, they'll just throw us all into the dungeon for a couple of days. It'll be like a sleepover!
9459 : You have my thanks. I'm sure you've heard from the guards how terribly-werribly important this mission is to me.
9460 : As you know, my brother, Minister Ajido-Marujido, has now spent a considerable amountaru of time in the Dark Dungeon.
9461 : My brother is a very resilient person.  However, the Dark Dungeon is a chamber that drains magical power. To spend this much time in there...
9462 : I beg of you! Please help me save him! I know this goes against all the rules, but I have to help my brother!
9463 : Help out? Leave it to me! It's too risky.
9464 : ...... That's true... But I know you can do it.
9465 : ...Thank you. %...
9466 : I've been researching a way to save my brother.
9467 : The chambers that lie beneath the central tower are sealed with the power of the stars and the moon. This means that the doors to those chambers can only be opened with an item imbued with that same power.
9468 : The rings carry-warried by the ministers are such items. Every time a minister is appointed, a ring is made and presented to the new minister by Heavens Tower.
9469 : After learning this, I took the % and set off for the Dark Dungeon...
9470 : Give it up, Apururu. That seal is beyond you.
9471 : Professor Shantotto...
9472 : I heard you were sneaking around, asking people about the Dark Dungeon. Why don't you just stand at the top of Heavens Tower and yell, I'm going to break my brother out of jail. Arrest me, someone!
9473 : How imprudent. And you were always such a bright student.
9474 : I won'taru just stand by and let my brother waste away in there! But I can't...the door won't...
9475 : I understand how you feel. I don't want to lose him either. Especially after all the trouble I've gone through to raise a tough-as-nails, wicked-wand-wielding, savage-spell-slinging wizard to take over as Orastery minister...
9476 : Listen up and I'll explain about the door deep below the tower.
9477 : This door, as you've discovered, can be opened by the power of the stars and the moon. Everything in the Horutoto Ruins is governed by this power.
9478 : However, the magic sealing these doors was weakened when several of the towers were severely damaged during the Great War.
9479 : And so up until now, these doors could have been opened with a single minister's ring--no need for a charm created by Heavens Tower, like before.
9480 : ...!
9481 : Haven't you figured it out? What does that head of yours contain? You would have realized it by now if you were using that melon you call a brain.
9482 : If you'll recall, Ajido-Marujido restored the power of the ruins, my dear dumpling. Now, you are no longer able to open the doors by using just a single ring.
9483 : Ohoho, such stupidity!
9484 : ......
9485 : ...Ah, forgive my amusement. I didn't come just to laugh at you. I have a brilliant idea to help your brother through.
9486 : Really, Professor Shantotto? Please tell me what I have to do.
9487 : Ohoho! You must gather the rings of the five ministers. Yes, yes. It is a chore. But, using their combined power, you should be able to dispel the seal on the door.
9488 : Bring the five rings to my house in Windurst Walls. We can only get started when you have them all. Ohoho!
9489 : Thank you so much, Professor. I will never forget this.
9490 : You'd better not. Ah, and there's one more thing you'd better not forget. Don't think of going after the rings yourself. It would be something you'd regret.
9491 : Leave it to an adventurer who's capable. Do you know %? [He's/She's] very useful and usable.
9492 : It almost boggles the mind how eager [he/she] is to stick [his/her] nose into some dangerous squeeze. There's no reason not to take advantage of %'s natural tendencies.
9493 : This is why I need your help. Here... This is my %.
9494 : I know it's a lot to ask, but...please save my brother. I beg of you.
9495 : With the rings of the five ministers, I should be able to open the Dark Dungeon. Please gather all five rings and take them to Professor Shantotto.
9496 : Please, save Ajido-Marujido. My poor, dear brother...
9497 : We have a lot to thank Minister Ajido-Marujido for. He might have mumble-grumbled about it, but he was always there to bail the Manustery out of money troubles.
9498 : We justaru follow whatever Minister Apururu decides. No mattaru what happens, we're behind her until the fat Galka sings.
9499 : Minister Ajido-Marujido succeeded in reactivating the towers, didn'taru he?
9500 : Isn't that a good thing? Why'd they have to go and throw him into the Dark Dungeon?
9501 : Rules were made to be broken. That way of thinking got Minister Ajido-Marujido thrown in the slammer-wammer.
9502 : And now his younger sister, Minister Apururu, has taken up the motto: Jails were made to be broken.
9503 : Of course! I had totarully forgotten. When my brother was arrested, his % was confiscated by Heavens Tower...
9504 : There's no way Semih Lafihna will just hand it over for no good reason. Maybe if you try talking with Kupipi...
9505 : What's that!? The Cardians have chosen a king!? What on Vana'diel are they thinking!?
9506 : I understand when Cardians no longer follow the orders of their masters. This happens when the concept of master ceases to have meaning to them.
9507 : But after this has happened, they shouldn't be taking on a new master. For that to happen...
9508 : ...... No. It's not possible!
9509 : ...... But putting that aside for the moment, please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.
9510 : I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...
9511 : ...Please take the rings to Professor Shantotto in Windurst Walls.
9512 : I mustaru apologize, I was a little-bitty distracted by what you told me...
9513 : You've completed the preparations for opening the Dark Dungeon!? Wonderful! You have my mostaru heartfelt thanks!
9514 : Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go! ...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.
9515 : We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, %.
9516 : Now, to the Dark Dungeon we go! ...Oh, that won't do. Professor Shantotto said I shouldn't be seen traveling with you.
9517 : We'll rendezvous by the door. Please be careful, %.
9518 : %. ...My brother has yet to open his eyes...
9519 : Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do... If he doesn't regain consciousness...
9520 : ...... But I must stay strong. Thank you, adventurer.
9521 : I will never forget what you have done to help my dear brother.
9522 : Oh, and about the %... Professor Shantotto still...
9523 : Well, perhaps you should go and ask the professor.
9524 : %. ...My brother has yet to open his eyes...
9525 : Professor Shantotto came to check on his condition, but there was nothing she could do... If he doesn't regain consciousness...
9526 : Things don'taru look good. If Ajido-Marujido doesn't wake up, Minister Apururu may have murder-wurder to answer for...not just a jailbreak!
9527 : Wait a minute. Wasn't there an adventurer who went to the dungeon with the minister? What if we shift all the blame onto [him/her]...?
9528 : You're worried, rightaru? I'm worried about Minister Ajido-Marujido, too.
9529 : I'm so worried, the Cardians I've made have learned how to sigh from me. What a dilemma. <sigh>
9530 : I can'taru believe there was a jailbreaky! Minister Apururu is so cooly!
9531 : But I get the feelingy there was someone along to help her... It went just a little too well for one of Minister Apururu's schemeys.
9532 : There's a Windurst Waters merrrchant making a big fuss over a Mana Orb, you say?
9533 : Ahaha, serves him rrright! That old coot, Honoi-Gomoi, always trrrying to get what he wants by any means possible.
9534 : He seems terribly anxious to get his hands on that orb. Why don't you be a sporrrt and give it back? I promise I won't say anything.
9535 : You want to talk to me about Mana Orbs? I'm sorry, but I'm up to my earlobes in work at the moment. Could you come back another time?
9536 : This is... This is a terribly-werribly old Cardian card...
9537 : But there's something strange about it. There's no mark, just this odd-bodd picture. I can't sense any magic from it, either.
9538 : How unusual. Ordinarily, Cardian cards are imbued with powerful magic.
9539 : The Cardian cards were a creation of my father, the previous Minister of the Manustery. The holder of the card could use it to remove the magic animating the card's respective Cardian.
9540 : Do you understand the whammy-ramifications of this? The older Cardians could use the cards in their possession to deactivate other Cardians.
9541 : ...My father had essentially made it possible for Cardians to kill each other, just like people can. Isn't that horrible-worrible...?
9542 : Ah, forgive me! I seem to have drifted on to a darker topic. Enough of that, back to this card!
9543 : This card holds no power over its respective Cardian. Which means it's more than likely just a reject.
9544 : Either that...or could it be... This card has no respective Cardian? That would mean that this is a unique card...
9545 : %, please let me buy this card off you! I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye!
9546 : Have you heard? Ajido-Marujido has rrregained consciousness.
9547 : Word of these goings-on has yet to rrreach Heavens Tower, so keep up the charade on your way to the Manustery.
9548 : Ajido-Marujido had been in a coma since collapsing in the Dark Dungeon, rrright?
9549 : He would probably be dead by now if no one had gone to save him. What an awful place.
9550 : Th-the Orastery Minister has finally r-regained c-consciousness.
9551 : D-do you realize now what a t-terrible-werrible place the Dark Dungeon is? Even a p-powerful mage like Ajido-Marujido wasn't immune to its e-effects.
9552 : These Tarutaru sure can be a vicious little bunch.
9553 : We Mithra would neverrr leave someone anguishing in torment like that. Those who transgress against Mithran law are cut down cleanly and face-to-face by the Mithran Trackerrr.
9554 : Heavens Tower is gonna, like, totally notice that the Dark Dungeon is empty at any time now.
9555 : We Mithra are born with, you know, a sixth sense and stuff. You can bet that Semih Lafihna's tail is totally twitching right now.
9556 : Ah, %--my dear brother has finally woken from his coma!
9557 : He's right here. Please come with me!
9558 : %, we have some serious-werious problems!
9559 : Thanks to you, I was able to see all that was written in the Book of the Gods. We must act before Windurst is wiped off the face of Vana'diel...
9560 : After I found you missing from the Dark Dungeon, I knew I'd find you here, Ajido-Marujido!
9561 : Semih Lafihna!?
9562 : Great galloping gigas, I just can't get away from you...
9563 : I'm not here to arrest you this time. You must come with me to Heavens Tower immediately!
9564 : The bearer of darkness has returned!
9565 : The bearer of darkness!? What of the Star Sibyl?
9566 : We don't know. We haven't been able to open the door to her chambers. But with your magic, we should be able to get in...
9567 : I don't think I've ever seen Semih Lafihna in such a tizzy-wizzy.
9568 : The Star Sibyl... Ajido-Marujido... I hope they'll be okay...
9569 : Goddess! Are you certain? Ajido-Marujido has received a pardon from the Star Sibyl!?
9570 : And permission to enter Karaha-Baruha's Animastery... No matter how many times I hear it, I just can'taru believe it...!
9571 : Apururu. I know you have-ethy a lot on your mind with Ajido-Marujido and all, but I wonder if I might have a moment-ethy?
9572 : Doctor Yoran-Oran!
9573 : Ahem. I was given this letter by an adventurer. Apparently it was dropped-ethy by a mandragora inside the Boyahda Tree...
9574 : ...?
9575 : Wait, this handwriting...!?
9576 : I see you recognize-ethy the author. He's being held-ethy prisoner somewhere in the Boyahda Tree, and needs help to escape.
9577 : But I figured-ethy, considering who... I figured-ethy I should leave this mattaru up to you and your brother.
9578 : So much has passed-ethy between you siblings and the author of that letter. I'll justaru pretend-ethy that I never saw it.
9579 : Well, I've taken up enough-ethy of your time. Keep your chin up, little Apururu.
9580 : What should I do...? I can't think straightaru. All this time I thought he had died.
9581 : Goddess above! My father, alive! I don't know what to do. What should I do, adventurer?
9582 : What to do? We must save him! Leave him to rot!
9583 : Usually, that would be my firstaru thought, but...
9584 : I almostaru wish I could, but...
9585 : Could I ask you to help me? I want you to go to the Boyahda Tree and find my father...Zonpa-Zippa.
9586 : And when you do find him, if...if he really is alive, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?
9587 : Help Apururu? Leave it to me! Leave him to rot!
9588 : I'm begging you. I have no desire to see my father again. I don'taru want to end up hating him even more than I do now.
9589 : %, thank you for being so understanding!
9590 : Ah, one more thing. Please don't tell any of this to my brother. I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his importantaru research.
9591 : If my father really is alive in the Boyahda Tree, I have some questions I want you to ask him. Why did the Cardians rise up against him? Who is this Cardian they have chosen for a king?
9592 : I really should be asking my dear brother's advice on this mattaru, but I wouldn't want news of our father to interfere with his research...
9593 : ... I still can'taru believe my father was alive...
9594 : Hmm? You have a letter from him? An explanation for the actions of the Cardians?
9595 : This is incredible...! Joker was created by the famous Karaha-Baruha...!?
9596 : What was that bit about Karaha-Baruha?
9597 : ...Ajido-Marujido!
9598 : What's wrong with you? You went all pasty-wasty white as soon as you saw me. What mischief have you been up to?
9599 : I...
9600 : I don't know what to say. To hear this...and on top of knowing the old coot was still breathing...
9601 : The King of the Cardians is the creation of a dead genius? What on Vana'diel is going on!?
9602 : There's something I don't understand. Who brought the Cardian back to life in the first place? How was this possible?
9603 : You need a massive amountaru of magic to restore life to a Cardian. Not to mention the use of forbidden rituals...
9604 : ...
9605 : Even more importantaru is the fact that the ritual would have brought Karaha-Baruha back from the dead.
9606 : And if he really is alive and kicking again, why hasn't he been to see the Star Sibyl?
9607 : Is there something preventaruing him from putting in an appearance? Or is he planning something, off in the shadows...?
9608 : ... A summoning...
9609 : That's it! Karaha-Baruha was focused on perfecting a complete summoning.
9610 : Karaha-Baruha wasn't trying to enlist the aid of the Great Beast, Fenrir. He wanted to completely enslave its will.
9611 : If he had succeeded in his efforts... Karaha-Baruha wouldn't be the only one brought back to life...
9612 : %! The Full Moon Fountain! We mustaru stop the Star Sibyl!
9613 : %, please go after my brother!
9614 : The Full Moon Fountain...! I've got an awfully bad feeling about this!
9615 : ... I g-got an advance on my s-salary...
9616 : This m-month I have to try to g-get by on %...
9617 : ...... Grrr...
9618 : Captain Buuma said something that really upset me...! I'm in such a state, my furrr is starting to fall out...!
9619 : I just saw Ajido-Marujido leaving the Manustery in, like, full view...
9620 : Should he be, y'know, walking around outside and stuff? Shouldn't he be using, like, some sorta invisibility spell thingy?
9621 : What happened at the Full Moon Fountain? I wanted to ask my brother, but he hasn't visitarued the Manustery at all lately.
9622 : Maybe I should go to the Animastery to talk with him. Something about all this is really giving me the heeber-jeebers...
9623 : I heard that Minsiter Ajido-Marujido was pardoned for his crimes. Well, isn'taru that a surprise?
9624 : This is, y'know, one of those high-level, governmentaru things. There's gotta be some back room, political-type dealy-weals going on here.
9625 : Do you know what's going on, %? Ajido-Marujido has been pardoned for his crimes, and the guards have escaped any disciplinary action, despite our insubordination...
9626 : Has something happened within Heavens Tower? They've sent us another mission for you.
9627 : According to the mission statement, the Yagudo have proposed a rrrevision to the peace treaty...
9628 : ... I'm well aware I shouldn't be poking my nose where it doesn't belong, but my Mithran instincts are making my tail twitch.
9629 : Heavens Tower has rrrequested your presence. The Yagudo have sent a proposal to the Star Sibyl asking for a rrrevision of the peace treaty.
9630 : The Star Sibyl is more likely to keep the peace, rrrather than object to any of the Yagudo's rrridiculous demands...
9631 : ... Naturally, I have been informed of Semih Lafihna's report to Chieftainness Perih Vashai.
9632 : Let us worry about the Yagudo--You just keep your mind on the task you have been given. Are we clear?
9633 : M-Minister Ajido-Marujido has been a-absolved of his crimes! N-now Windurst can f-finally return to a state of peace!
9634 : ...Wh-what? Wh-why are you l-looking at me with p-pity like thataru...?
9635 : P-please don't t-tell me something else is wr-wrong!
9636 : Captain Buuma was saying that our work might dry up completely after this next mission. If that happens, I'm gonna go hungry.
9637 : That's why I've started fishing again. I bought the most amazing fishing rod! It was so nice of Miiri-Wohri to lend me the money!
9638 : Even though you, like, totally trrrashed the beastmen's boss guy, the Yagudo still act like they're tougher than us.
9639 : Something fishy's going on. It's like, the Yagudo are prrreying on our weaknesses...or something like that. You're, y'know, all important and stuff, so you should know what's going on, rrright?
9640 : %, you have the task of gathering the three verses left by the ancient ones, don'taru you?
9641 : Ajido-Marujido mentioned Ro'Maeve, the Chamber of Oracles, and The Temple of Uggalepih...I'm pretty sure.
9642 : All this talk of ancient peoples and places I've never-ever even heard of... My brother seems to have gained some amazing knowledge.
9643 : I'm certain that we'll be able to save the Star Sibyl now that he's back with us. We mustaru play our parts, too.
9644 : Minister Apururu has been up late every night, researchingy the old Cardians made by Zonpa-Zippa.
9645 : It's really very simple if you wanted to disabley the old Cardians. All you would have to do is searchy out Minister Zonpa-Zippa and takey him out of the picture...
9646 : Wa-wa-wait! That justaru slippedy out! I don'taru want to go to the Dark Dungeon!
9647 : You would definitely be able to slow the Cardians down with a big ol' blast of magey-wagey power.
9648 : But the problem is where do you get that kinda power, and who do you get to handle it? To be perfectaruly honest I don't think Miss Apururu is up to it.
9649 : Hmmm...if you could draw on the Mana Orbs of all the Cardians in town then maybe... I better not suggestaru that to the minister, she would just keel over from worry.
9650 : Minsiter Apururu is doing her bestaru to hide something from us...
9651 : But she's so bad at lying-wying it makes it hard for us to pretend that we don't notice.
9652 : ...I have heard from Semih Lafihna that a time of rrreckoning has come to this land.
9653 : We Mithra have always known that the world is but a sharrrd of a greater power.
9654 : The abundant life and light born from that sharrrd, that single destiny...
9655 : ...Leave the Yagudo to us. We will not fall against the tides of evil. You, too, must make your stand.
9656 : There is no need for panic. We alrrready have details on the enemy's army within our grrrasp.
9657 : We have done more than simply glare at the Yagudo these past twenty years.
9658 : Several of our units are already concealed near the Yagudo strrronghold.
9659 : As soon as the enemy makes its move, we'll go straight for the thrrroat. I can almost see the panicked faces of those Yagudo wrrretches.
9660 : The magic doll...builtaru by Professor Koru-Moru...
9661 : Wearing the %...made by Doctor Shantotto...
9662 : Then have Doctor Yoran-Oran constructaru the seal...
9663 : Oh, adventurer! You've brought all three verses!?
9664 : It's time then! I mustaru go to Doctor Yoran-Oran's manor and pick up the finished work.
9665 : My brother should be waiting in Heavens Tower. Please tell him that I'll be rightaru there!
9666 : Adventurer! We mustaru hurry to the Full Moon Fountain!
9667 : I have no idea what's going to happen, so we should be prepared for the doom-gloomiest worst. It may come down to a battle with the Bearer of Darkness!
9668 : You have done your utmost for Windurst these many months. As the Captain of the Windurst Woods guards, I formally extend to you our gratitude and friendship.
9669 : If I had my way, you would be permanently stationed in Windurst. However, I know that your adventurer's blood would never allow you to settle down for long.
9670 : Be sure to come back and visit on occasion, though, and bring us tales and aromas of the new lands you pass through on your travels.
9671 : Ah, %! S-so good to s-see you!
9672 : S-so many t-terrible-werrible things were g-going on that we d-didn'taru know about...
9673 : B-but everyone p-pulled together and s-saved the day! I'm j-just s-speechless!
9674 : Fishing is fun, but I'm a Windurst Woods guard first and foremost! The safety of this city is my top priority!
9675 : Oh, and by the way, I finally learned your name. You're %, right?
9676 : It could be just my imagination, but I feel like, y'know, all the Mithra in Windurst have finally become united in spirrrit.
9677 : I also feel that we've become, like, buddies with all the little Tarutaru. And you, of course, %. You're, like, my hero!
9678 : I still can'taru believe it. Everything that happened at the Full Moon Fountain seems so surrealy-weal.
9679 : It was so scary-wary, and so heartbreakingly sad. But both my brother and the Star Sibyl have come back to us safely.
9680 : There was nothing I could've done by myselfily-welfily, but with everybody's help, we've broughtaru the light back to Windurst!
9681 : Thank you, everyone! I'm going to work even harder to make the world a better place for everybody to live in.
9682 : Minister Apururu is still studying the Cardians builty by her father, Zonpa-Zippa.
9683 : With all the queasy-weasy experiments detailed in the previous minister's notes, though, I don'taru thinky Minister Apururu really wants to read through them...
9684 : Maybe she's foundy some clues on how to stop those Cardians. Don't give up, Minister Apururu!
9685 : Many Cardians died willingly for the sakey-wake of their king, the Cardian Joker.
9686 : Former minister Zonpa-Zippa loved to build in those sorts of tragic loyalties... He probably put in a self-destructaru mechanism, too.
9687 : The ring of the Manustery has finally-winally made its way back to the hand of Minister Apururu. Now I can make new and improved Cardian-wardians!
9688 : Hmm, I think I'll inventaru one that has a spinning staff attack. That should make a nice breezey-weeze for those hot summer days...
9689 : It has rrreturned. The great power that belongs to this land...
9690 : I have come to realize that the world exists to help us find a way to bridge the gaps between the races.
9691 : And we people are here to fill the emptiness that is borrrn in that world.
9692 : Let us move forward to a new future. When you lose sight of tomorrow, just lie upon the earrrth, hear the voice of the wind, and gaze into the endless sky.
9693 : ...Adventurer. I prrray that the Windurst that lives in my heart will bloom in your heart as well.
9694 : There was a place in Kazham where you could feel the power of the land.
9695 : Twenty years ago that same grrreat energy overflowed from the plains of Sarutabaruta. All of our trrroubles began with the loss of that power.
9696 : After the Great War, the Star Sibyl kept the truth of events from Chieftainness Perih Vashai.
9697 : Considering the nature of Tarutaru, this is not altogether an unusual occurrence. But considering how we fought and died beside them for this land, I can't help but feel betrrrayed.
9698 : Tada!!! The All-New C-3000!
9699 : This new Cardian is truly amazing, I tell you. Not only can it defeat its enemies before you can say Now, where's that darn Cardian got to? but it also brings back the booty from the battleground!
9700 : All the loot my new boy'll bring in should stretch the Manustery's coffers to bursty-wursting! Not to mention the hefty raise that'll be added to my salary. <wink-wink>
9701 : But first I have to teach him to bring back the good stuff and leave the junk... And that's where you come in, my fine adventuring friend! Do you think you could get me % and %?
9702 : Let's get cracking! Time is gil, you know!
9703 : Have you broughtaru the items for the All-New C-3000 to look at?
9704 : I need you to bring me % and %. Whatcha waiting for?
9705 : Excellentaru work! Here's something for your troubles!
9706 : I'm going to make oodles and scoodles of All-New C-3000s, so bring me all the % and % that you can find.
9707 : Hmm, paying you that reward has put me in the red, but it's all part of a larger investmentaru. I'm gonna be rich!
9708 : I'm going to make oodles and scoodles of All-New C-3000s, so bring me all the % and % that you can find.
9709 : If you find any more of those % and %, hand 'em over to me!
9710 : I don't understand it. The All-New C-3000s haven't been bringing in any % or %...
9711 : Where did I go wrong? All my calculations and adjustments were spot on. Even Minister Apururu said the craftsmanship was perfectaru.
9712 : I can'taru let a little hiccup like this stand in the way of my impending fortune! I'll just keep giving the All-New C-3000s more % and % until they get it right!
9713 : Keep on bringing me those items! This is going to work, I can feel it!
9714 : Aren't the new Cardians that Kopuro-Popuro is making supposed to be for patrol duty?
9715 : All they're doing is wandering around Sarutabaruta, not fighting anything. I wonder what they're doing out there? Looking for buried treasure?
9716 : Hmmm. Has it all become clear, my fledgling arrrcher?
9717 : Do you know where your place is? The time for the hunt? The prey your arrows should seek?
9718 : Do you everrr experience moments of hesitation? It is that confusion that sends your arrows wide of the mark.
9719 : Take this untrrried bow. It is kindrrred to the slender sapling. As a young tree is bent by the fury of a storrrm, so will this bow's path be warped by your indecision.
9720 : Now, my fledgling arrrcher. Go forth and overcome the winds of doubt that taunt your arrow's flight. Trrrain until the sapling bow has become a steady oak in your hands.
9721 : What trrroubles you, my fledgling arrrcher? Do you seek counsel in some matter?
9722 : What trrroubles you I have no questions. I lost the %... I give in to the winds.
9723 : To lose your bow is to lose yourself. If you forget who you are and what you strrrive for, your future holds only stagnation.
9724 : My fledgling arrrcher, were you unable to master the doubt within you...?
9725 : Give in to your doubt? Yes, I cannot go on. No, I will try harrrder.
9726 : That is a pity indeed. You must set the bow free by your own hand. The withered branch rrreturns to the earth. This is the way of nature.
9727 : When you feel the bow no longer rrresponds to your inner conflict, rrreturn it here to me.
9728 : The bow still appears to rrretain the greenness of youth, and your doubt has yet to be rrresolved.
9729 : There is no need for haste. The sapling grrrows slowly into the forest giant.
9730 : This bow is no longer the sapling I gave you. It has become a mighty tree, grown straight and strong and true.
9731 : You have grown as well, my fledgling arrrcher. It is time to test the new maturity of your archery.
9732 : I have prrrepared a battlefield for you at Cape Teriggan. Use this map to find your foe and bring back the % to prove your victorrry.
9733 : Cape Teriggan is the battlefield where you will test your newfound maturrrity. Was there anotherrr matter you wished to discuss?
9734 : That is most unforrrtunate. However, I'm sure you have just rrreason for your decision. If you ever wish to banish the doubt within you, come once again to my side.
9735 : It appears your arrows flew fast and true. I will imparrrt to you a technique worthy of your rrresolve.
9736 : With strrrength comes potential for new abilities.
9737 : Do you see, my arrrcher? Strength is the grrreat trunk of the tree, and the rrresultant skills its many branches.
9738 : You have learned the weapon skill Empyreal Arrow!
9739 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'll recall your past. Your stories of love, anger, triumph, and shame, The river of memories runs deep and vast.
9740 : The minstrel of melodies is my name, For a mere # gil I'd recall your past. But I find that you're lacking in cash or in fame, So until that time, my kind offer will last.

9752 : If you put this on and walk around, something...unexpected might happen...
9753 : Thank you...
9754 : If two people with the same costumes form a party and approach a bomb balloon, then...
9755 : The Troupe Valeriano, at your service! Well, I'm more of a behind-the-scenes kinda gal, not an entertainer.
9756 : People call me Nokky the Tree-shaker! While the other guys are doing their thing, I work on the sidelines as a quiver-maker. Basically, I can make it easier for you to lug around those bundles of ninety-nine arrows or bolts or whatever.
9757 : I've been doing this for a while now, so I've learned to bundle all sorts of stuff...
9758 : %, %, %, %, %, and % I've always been able to do...
9759 : But now I can also bundle %, %, %, %, %, and %.
9760 : Not to mention %, %, %, %, %, %, and %.
9761 : %, %, and plain old %!
9762 : And of course, %, %, %, %, and %!
9763 : Then there's everyone's favorite %, %, and %.
9764 : Finally, new to my bundling repertoire, we have %, %, %, and %!
9765 : I can even bundle those elemental cards that corsairs use!
9766 : Aren't you imprrressed? Keeping up with all these new types of ammunition is hard work!
9767 : Oh, and for the rrrecord, anything else is too much trrrouble to deal with. Not my thing.
9768 : This ain't no charity, though. I'm not really interested in gil, but... Let's see here... Flowers...? Yeah, you bring me % for every ninety-nine arrows, bolts, or whatever you want organized, and we got a deal.
9769 : I can make a quiver or pouch for up to seven sets of the same kind of ammunition. So you could bring me, say, one hundred ninety-eight % and two of those %, for example. I like to do things real efficient-like, you see, so make sure they're in multiples of ninety-nine.
9770 : smiles slyly at you.
9771 : What kinda smart-alecky baloney is this!? I told you to bring me the same kinda ammunition in complete sets. And don't forget the flowers, neither.
9772 : Just a moment there, my fine friend, got a call coming in on my linkshell. Come back in a bit and I'll sort you out.
9773 : And here you go! Come back soon, and bring your friends!
9774 : I'm real sorry, but there's nothing I can do with those.
9775 : It's time for the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza, kupo! Here, take this initial egg. Collect and trade eggs until you have made a First 3 combination. When you're done, bring the combo back to me for an egg-squisite prize, kupo!
9776 : This year, those who make special undecennial combinations will receive particularly egg-ceptional prizes, kupo!
9777 : Of course, we wouldn't want you counting your chocobos before they hatch. Please egg-xert the effort to make a First 3 combination before going all out on these spegg-tacular new ones, kupo.
9778 : When you've gathered a First 3 combination, bring the eggs back to me! Also, if you want, I can trade you more initial eggs, but you'll have to make it worth my while, kupo!
9779 : Well, that's it for my anniversary egg-splanation. Happy hunting, kupo!
9780 : Egg-cellent! Here's your prize, kupo! Now if only somebody would bring me a super combo... Oh, egg-scuse me! Forget I said that, kupo!

9785 : Eggs-actly what I wanted! Here's your reward, kupo!
9786 : Ku-kupo! Such an egg-stravagant item, for little old me? Here's a whole basketful of initial eggs for you, kupo!
9787 : My eyes! My eyes! Get out of here, and take those egg-ceptionally nasty things with you, kupo!
9788 : Kupo... Kupo! Please! No more, kupo! Here, take these and get out of here, kupo!
9789 : Hey, I can only trade with you once a day. We wouldn't want to make the egg hunt over easy, now, kupo!
9790 : Hey, you look new here, kupo! If you need anything, just let me know!
9791 : Heh heh heh... I have something egg-specially egg-citing in store for you, kupo!
9792 : And, because you're [as cool as egg salad/as hot as a fried egg, sunny-side up], I'm going to give you a super-duper present, kupo!

9818 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
9819 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!

9824 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!

9826 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
9827 : You haven't earned my really special present yet! Only truly dauntless dungeon-delvers get that, kupo!
9828 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!

9837 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
9838 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
9839 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
9840 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
9841 : You can only carry one %.

9845 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
9846 : Boo-hah-hah...kupo!
9847 : Huh? Why aren't you jumping out of your skin in absolute terror? I would've died of fright, kupo!
9848 : Here, take this as a testament to your courage. Exchange it for the item your partner received so you can prove that you both reached the goal safely, kupo!
9849 : Return with the evidence of your success to the moogle in town. Handing over your partner's item will prove that you were both able to reach me, kupo!
9850 : Oh, and here's a picture of how your partner's face looked when I popped out of nowhere to scare you. You should hand this in at the same time, kupo! Kupupupu...
9851 : This place is crawling with nasties. You should probably head back to town so you can testify to your partner's bravery.
9852 : Why do ghosts say boo, anyway?
9853 : I heard that going to a dark, scary dungeon is the best way to test your courage. This place definitely qualifies, kupo!
9854 : Maybe I'm doing something wrong, kupo?

9899 : <Match #> Entry period begins:  Briefing begins:
9900 : I apologize, but your level is too low to participate in an official Brenner match.
9901 : Official matches are scheduled to begin at the following times: Match 1: # Match 2:  Match 3:
9902 : Teleportation to the Isle is free of charge, but a participation fee of # gil is required before each match.
9903 : Travel to the Isle? Yes. Not yet.
9904 : What would you like to know about? Basic rules. Official/private matches. Flammen-Brenner. Flamme. Match score. Petras and quarrying. Sprint. KO. Return.
9905 : The basic rules of Brenner are as follows:
9906 : First, the participants divide into two teams. Each side's camp contains the same number of Flammen-Brenner.
9907 : At the beginning of the match, half of each side's Flammen-Brenner will be ablaze with Flamme, or flame, while the other half will remain unlit.
9908 : Participants can seize a Flamme from the opposing side's Flammen-Brenner and carry it around the Isle.
9909 : The goal is to steal your opponent's Flamme and use them to light your side's Flammen-Brenner.
9910 : The side that succeeds in lighting all of its Flammen-Brenner will be declared the winner after a specified amount of time.
9911 : If neither side is victorious before the match ends, the outcome will be judged based on the score. The match score section of the rulebook contains more information on this subject.
9912 : Brenner is significantly divided into public and private matches. Official matches are held periodically according to level and feature general participation.
9913 : You cannot reserve the Isle when an official match is being held.
9914 : No items are necessary for participation, but a minor fee will be collected. You will be unable to participate if your level is too low.
9915 : The match outcome will be recorded unless the number of participants fails to exceed # members, or if there are fewer than # members in a match where the two sides' numbers differ. In such cases, the game will be considered a training match and will not be recorded.
9916 : Private matches require a reservation, and participation may be limited. The Master of Ceremonies (MC) can freely adjust the rules and control match proceedings.
9917 : LS Liga is a form of private match. You can learn more about LS Liga by speaking to a Marshal.
9918 : A Flammen-Brenner is a device that contains a Flamme (flame). The Flammen-Brenner is covered by a grate that will open after taking a set amount of damage, exposing the Flamme.
9919 : The participants must utilize this chance to seize the Flamme before the grate recloses. Once the grate is closed, the Flammen-Brenner will begin recovering from the damage it has been dealt.
9920 : If you manage to open the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner and capture their Flamme, you should make haste to light one of the Flammen-Brenner on your side.
9921 : After a certain amount of time, the Flamme will burn out and the opposing team's Flammen-Brenner will be relit.
9922 : Also, please note that you cannot quicken your pace using any special abilities while you are in possession of a Flamme.
9923 : In the event that neither side fulfills the conditions for victory, the outcome of the match will be evaluated based on score.
9924 : Ten points are awarded to each side for every lit Flammen-Brenner, while one point is awarded whenever a Flamme is captured, used to light a Flammen-Brenner, or recaptured from an opponent. One point is also awarded for protecting the Flammen-Brenner for a certain period of time.
9925 : Like Ballista, quarry (/quarry) can be used while playing Brenner. Participants may use this ability to dig up Petras and temporary items.
9926 : However, unlike Ballista Petras, Brenner Petras have no effect on the match score. You can trade a Petra to a Pursuivant to recover your HP and MP at no expense to TP.
9927 : Sprint cannot be used while carrying a Petra. Also, please note that the scout ability cannot be used in Brenner.
9928 : Petras will be lost in the event of a KO, but can be carried over from one match to another.
9929 : The sprint (/sprint) ability can be used to increase the player's speed when not in possession of a Flamme or Petras.
9930 : In the event of a KO, you will be returned to your team's camp. However, recovery will take longer the more often you fall in battle.
9931 : In other words, you will receive a penalty if you fall immediately after recovering from KO. In addition, your TP will be reduced to zero and you will lose any Petras in your possession.
9932 : I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Could you start over from the beginning?
9933 : You wish to hear of Al'Taieu, adventurer?
9934 : A moment. To ask questions in such a blunt manner does not befit a [lady/gentleman].
9935 : My most humble apologies for the intrusion, Chieftainness Perih Vashai.
9936 : My name is Louverance N Mistalle. To save the people of Vana'diel, I seek the truth that hides behind the veil of history.
9937 : A time of apocalypse is at hand. I beg you for the guiding knowledge of ages, passed down through the Mithran race...
9938 : I understand your situation. However, I know nothing of the city painted in that picture.
9939 : Even if you were to ask the Mithran Trrrackers, I doubt they would have an answer for you. They are on a journey to fulfill an important duty.
9940 : ...? If I may be so bold, are the Mithran Trackers following the scent of some grave crime?
9941 : Yes. They came to demand atonement for the sins of the Tavnazian cardinal.
9942 : The cardinal? What crime could she have committed?
9943 : Strrrangely enough, her sins are related to the picture you speak of.
9944 : That picture was stolen from the Temple of Uggalepih.
9945 : A Mithran Trrracker traveled to Tavnazia to recover it, but was instead presented with a deal by the cardinal.
9946 : A deal?
9947 : The cardinal apparently knew everything about the legend rrrecited by the Mithra, and the duty that it entails.
9948 : She also stated that the means to carry out that duty had been prepared in Tavnazia.
9949 : The trrracker had no choice but to accept the deal. The fate of Vana'diel's people was placed in the hands of the cardinal.
9950 : Chieftainness, indulge me if you will.
9951 : What is this legend, and what of the duty it reveals? What had your people intended to do?
9952 : That duty was given to the Mithra by the ancient race depicted in the picture. A duty to awaken the sleeping gods...
9953 : The sleeping gods...!?
9954 : Surely you have heard the tale of the ancient rrrace that wounded Vana'diel by opening the Gates of Paradise?
9955 : The Emptiness that poured from that wound tried to swallow everything in its path: the mountains, the seas, the skies, the forests, even life itself.
9956 : The living beings of Vana'diel decided to use the tears that Altana had shed to cleanse the world.
9957 : However, a battle erupted between the king of people and the king of dragons over the fifth tear. A conflict that knew no end...
9958 : The people that survived used the power of the sleeping gods to heal the wounded land.
9959 : And that is the legend told by the Mithra?
9960 : Adventurer. In your trrravels you would have seen the giant, glowing crystals that lie hidden far away from civilization.
9961 : Those crystals are the rrresting places of the gods.
9962 : Slumbering within are the immortal beings who were called forth to heal the land in the age of legend.
9963 : The wounded land of Vana'diel bleeds forth dreaded Emptiness...
9964 : It is now time for us to awaken the sleeping deities, and mend our sufferrring world.
9965 : And this is the role that the cardinal attempted to fill? But how...?
9966 : That has not yet been rrrevealed to me.
9967 : But if you must learn the answer to that question, you should ask the Tavnazian theologian who was a survivor of the Great War.
9968 : Before she is punished for that crrrime...
9969 : ...!
9970 : Do you need further explanation? The Mithran sin hunters never forgive a crime. The sin does not die with the sinner.
9971 : Be careful with your actions. It is not our place to judge your sins, but in time, your sins may come to judge you.
9972 : What do you make of her words, %?
9973 : The theology of the Mithra veers quite dramatically from that of the San d'Orian Cathedral in several respects.
9974 : The legend concerning the five tears of Altana is especially at odds with what the Elvaan believe...
9975 : That is why I warn you not to swallow her tale without question.
9976 : Talk of legends aside, the chieftainness's description of the Emptiness that has appeared in every corner of Vana'diel is an indisputable truth.
9977 : However, the Mithran Trackers are now chasing after the theologian, Prishe, and not Cardinal Mildaurion.
9978 : Which would mean that even the trackers were unable to locate the whereabouts of the cardinal.
9979 : Does this mean that the cardinal has already bid farewell to this world?
9980 : Has my astonishing luck finally failed me...?
9981 : It is nice to see you after so long, sir. I wonder if you remember old Honoi-Gomoi?
9982 : I thought you might have informed me of your presence. I was mightaruly surprised to hear that you were in town.
9983 : As always, your visits cause quite a stir...
9984 : ...
9985 : But I do babble-wabble on. Your subordinates bade me pass this on to you.
9986 : It is an item that should help tremendously in your task.
9987 : But this is...!
9988 : Yes, indeed. It was broken when you crossed swords with that detestable Vukki.
9989 : I went to greataru lengths to have this repaired for you...
9990 : What's more, I finally made progress on the task you entrusted to me so long ago.
9991 : That despicable bounty hunter that caused you so much trouble, Goldmane...
9992 : You have information?
9993 : Yes. According to some Mithran pirates, the rascal has purchased a small, desertarued island south of Mhaura...
9994 : I see. My luck has not forsaken me after all...
9995 : %. I ask that you leave the rest of this task to me, alone.
9996 : My incredible luck does not extend to those around me. It may prove to be more of a hindrance than a help. Until next we meet...
9997 : Adventurer, I would advise against traveling with that Elvaan. He has a dark, dark past.
9998 : If one does not cleanse oneself of that darkness, it will rrreturn to haunt them. That is Mother Nature's way...
9999 : Please have a look at these wonderful products from Qufim Island! You won't regret it!
10000 : Now that I've finally learned the language here, I'd like to start my own business. If I could only find a supplier...
10001 : Hey! You're an adventurer, right? You're supposed to help people with stuff, right? Take this letter to that [cool guy/cute lady] in the red hat, okay?
10002 : Excuse me, [mister/lady]. Would you take this letter to the [guy/lady] in the red hat?
10003 : Adventurer-[man/lady]! Could you take this letter to that funny [guy/lady] in the red hat?
10004 : I would like to take this letter to a certain [fellow/woman] wearing a red chapeaux; however, my parents do not allow me to stray far from home. Kind adventurer, might you deliver it in my stead?
10005 : Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
10006 : Whoa! Thanks, [misterrr/lady]!
10007 : Thank you so very much, [sir/ma'am]!
10008 : Another present? Sorry, but I only have two hands, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer!
10009 : Wow! Another present! Ah... But I don't think I can carry all these home at once. Why don't you come back later?
10010 : Hey, didn't you just give me a prrresent? You're starrrting to scare me, [mister/lady]...
10011 : I just accepted a gift from you, kind [sir/ma'am]. I could not possibly accept another.
10012 : ou've brought joy to the children of Vana'diel!
10013 : ou've brought barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel!
10014 : ##
10015 : Have you seen the trees? Have you seen the trees? It must be that time of the year again, kupo! It's time for the Starlight Celebration, kupo-po-po!
10016 : I've even heard rumors that the craftsman that built the trees has crossed the seven-and-a-half seas to work here in Windurst, kupo!
10017 : And if that's not enough, there's this suspicious character in a red hat calling himself a smilebringer that's been hanging around the city's innocent children!
10018 : He said he was here to deliver presents, but I smell trouble. If anything were to happen to Windurst's children... That's why I've been keeping an eye on the stranger by pretending to assist him and his underlings, kupo!
10019 : Speaking of children... There were some kids that were looking for an adventurer to do a favor for them, kupo...
10020 : [None in Windurst Waters/One in Windurst Waters/Two in Windurst Waters/Three in Windurst Waters]... [None in Windurst Walls/One in Windurst Walls/Two in Windurst Walls/Three in Windurst Walls], and... [None in Port Windurst/One in Port Windurst/Two in Port Windurst/Three in Port Windurst]...
10021 : Why don't you try helping them out, kupo? But if I find out that you laid a grubby finger on any one of them...
10022 : (Ah! One of the strange hat-man's underli--) Merry holidays, [Mr./Ms.] Adventurer! It looks like you [haven't brought any joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been slacking off on bringing joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing a tad bit of joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing a fair amount of joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing barrelfuls of joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing ridiculous amounts of joy to the children of Vana'diel,/have been bringing caravans loaded with ludicrous quantities of joy to the children of Vana'diel,] kupo!
10023 : Now, if you want, I could warp you to another nation so you could bother--I mean, bring joy to the wee ones there, kupo.
10024 : What do you say? I'm staying right here! Off to San d'Oria! Off to Bastok! Off to Windurst!
10025 : Bye
10026 : Hmph. It doesn't look like you've been bringing much holiday cheer, kupo... You can only obtain true joy by spreading it among others, kupo!
10027 : Have you seen any crazy Goblins riding around on chocobos lately, kupo?
10028 : Oh, you don't have to worry. They probably won't attack you. They're playing a game with us moogles, kupo!
10029 : You see, we take these cards and bury them around the outskirts of town. Then the Goblins go out and try to find them. If they do, they can bring them back to us and exchange them for different prizes, kupo.
10030 : This time, we spread them out all over the area, thinking that the Gobs wouldn't be able to cover that much land, kupo.
10031 : But that was before we learned that they had their own chocobos!
10032 : It's just not fair, kupo!
10033 : Now it's only a matter of time before those stinking beastmen find all the cards and we moogles lose the game, kupo!
10034 : And that's why we need your help, kupo! Would you go out into the field and find the cards before the Goblins do?
10035 : There is a variety of different sets. For each set you bring back safely, I'll secretly give you the present that we were going to give the Goblins, kupo!
10036 : For starters, why don't you try finding %, %, and %? That should throw those smelly Gobs for a real spin, kupo!
10037 : Great! A whole set, kupo! Ah, I wish I could be there to see the look on those Gobs' faces when all they find is an empty hole. Oh, right! Here's your reward, kupo!
10038 : If you have any extra time on your hands, try finding more card sets, kupo! We really have to stick it to those Gobs this year to show them who's boss!
10039 : Wow! Another set! You don't know how much this means to us, kupo! Here, take this!
10040 : You hand the clerk the % and # gil, and your set of armor is returned.
10041 : Hello, [sir/ma'am]. Have you ever found yourself throwing away items because your Mog Safe is overflowing with dusty sets of armor collected on your many adventures? My colleagues and I have heard the cries of our fellow adventurers and joined together to aid all those in need.

10065 : Have you seen the decorations? The Doll Festival has started, kupo!
10066 : I heard from my moogle sources that this is a celebration for the health and happiness of girls, kupo.
10067 : Apparently, the young lady and her beau would play empress and emperor, and would be joined by eight of their friends for the festivities, kupo.
10068 : Why don't you try making a ten-person party as well? We can all have fun celebrating the Doll Festival, kupo!
10069 : It looks like you have all the members you need. Time for the festival to begin, kupo!
10070 : After squeezing my moogle sources some more, they told me that people used to eat these during the festival. Here, you take one as well, kupo!
10071 : It looks like you have all the members you need, kupo!
10072 : In fact, the moogle grapevine tells me that this is the perfect Doll Festival combination, kupo!
10073 : As a reward for your blind luc--I mean, resourcefulness, I'm going to give you lots of these treats, kupo!
10074 : Just in case you didn't know, the three girls in your party represent ladies of the court who wait on the empress. Moogles know everything about festivals, kupo!
10075 : And by the way, the five guys in your group represent musicians who entertain the empress and emperor. I wish I could play an instrument, kupo!
10076 : Kupo!? Something's not right... Ah! This is a girl's festival and you don't have a girl in your party, kupo!
10077 : Kupo... I know I said this was a girl's festival, but you need at least one guy to play the emperor, kupo.
10078 : You obtain % and %!
10079 : You obtain %, %, and %!
10080 : You obtain %, %, %, and %!
10081 : You obtain 3 %, 3 %, 3 %, and 3 %!
10082 : Kupo? What happened to your ten-person party? You can't trick presents out of me, kupo!
10083 : Ooh, a shiny new adventurer! Join in the fun, kupo!
10084 : You can only celebrate the Doll Festival once a day. Try again tomorrow, kupo!
10085 : Hey! Your party has different members all of a sudden! Well, I guess I can give you this for having the right number of people at least, kupo!
10086 : Hey! Your party has lost touch with its feminine side! You need to find yourself a lady, kupo!
10087 : Hmm... You seem to have lost your male element. Can't have the guys running away from you, kupo!
10088 : At the request of a certain society, I am investigating the effects of the dreaded Emptiness on living beings.
10089 : You appear to be a well-traveled adventurer. Perhaps you have seen one of the Emptiness-ravaged creatures of which I speak?
10090 : We have labeled these monstrosities Empty Notorious Monsters, or ENMs...
10091 : Have you seen one? Indeed I have. I'm not quite sure...
10092 : Aha, so you have firsthand experience. You probably don't need a scholar's explanation, but please indulge me...
10093 : The material presence of ENMs has become temporary and insubstantial, meaning that those who have witnessed a particular ENM's existence are unable to encounter it again until a period of time has passed.
10094 : My research has allowed me to measure the length of time between ENM manifestations. Tell me, which ENM would you like to know about?
10095 : I wish to know about the ENM in... Nowhere in particular. The Spire of Holla. The Spire of Dem. The Spire of Mea. The Spire of Vahzl. Monarch Linn. The Shrouded Maw. Mine Shaft #2716. Bearclaw Pinnacle. Boneyard Gully.
10096 : You won't be able to encounter that particular ENM until  ( Earth time).
10097 : The ENM in that area should be sufficiently manifest for your next encounter.
10098 : You have no need of my expertise at the moment? Very well.
10099 : And now we come to the crux of the matter...
10100 : If there is an ENM that you are currently able to locate, I strongly urge you to take action.
10101 : These...creatures...are no longer natural beings of Vana'diel. They must be destroyed.
10102 : I cannot elaborate on the details, but know that the fate of the world depends on the early elimination of this threat...
10103 : Then perhaps it is best if you forget this conversation entirely.
10104 : I hope I have been of some assistance to you.
10105 : This dark plague grows ever stronger... If it is not stopped soon...
10106 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Vicious villains are venting violently outside the city walls, kupo!
10107 : We've divined that these creatures are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
10108 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these invaders! Behold the wondrous %, kupo!
10109 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit before you engage the enemy, kupo.
10110 : But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!
10111 : Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
10112 : The % will absorb a part of the villain's aura every time you attack, kupo.
10113 : Even if you don't topple the terror, bring the weapon to a moogle and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!
10114 : By the way, these monsters are running around in samurai-style armor. They may be hiding among other adventurers, so be on your guard, kupo!
10115 : Here's a new %. Bring it back to a moogle if you deal any damage to those samurai-styled scoundrels, kupo!
10116 : If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
10117 : Bring the weapon to a moogle after you've inflicted some damage to the marauding monsters and you'll get a reward to match the amount of aura you've absorbed, kupo!
10118 : I can see the aura you've absorbed from the enemy! Here's your reward, kupo!
10119 : With all the aura you've absorbed with the %, we've managed to create a new weapon. We'd like you to have it, kupo!
10120 : Which item will you use to enter? %. %.
10121 : ...
10122 : ...Outta my face, [buddy/lady].
10123 : I told you to scram! Or would you like a piece of me, huh? If I didn't have to waste my time bundlin' together ninja tools for sissy adventurers like you, I'd fill your ugly mug with bloody bolts faster than you could say Galkan sausage.
10124 : Eh? You're here to get your ninja tools bundled? Curse Altana! And people ask me why I hate this stinkin' job!
10125 : Well, don't just stand there like an idiot! I can't do any bundlin' until you fork over a set of 99 tools and %! And I ain't doin' no more than seven sets at one time, so don't even try it!
10126 : looks like he's ready to bite off the head of a baby coeurl...
10127 : What the hell is this!? Why don't you try bringin' what I asked for before I shove one of my sandals up your...nose!
10128 : Can't you see I'm busy right now!? Go play with your mommy, sissy!
10129 : Here, take 'em and scram. And don't say I ain't never did nothin' for you!
10130 : What the hell is this junk!? Why don't you try bringin' what I asked for before I shove one of my sandals up your...nose!
10131 : Have you ever heard of Blitz Buffalo, kupo? It's a fast and frenzied buffalo-chasing fiasco ferried in from a land to the far west of Quon!
10132 : We moogles thought it sounded like fun! So we rounded up a bunch of buffalos and set them loose in several places, kupo!
10133 : Also, we've tied an item to each buffalo! Anyone who catches one can keep the item as a reward! It's a great opportunity for adventurers, kupo!
10134 : But the buffalos aren't going to take a bunch of frantic adventurers chasing them lightly! You may have to knock one out before it yields its precious item, kupo!
10135 : If you manage to lay your hands on a buffalo, you better prepare to be flung around, kupo... Kupohoho.
10136 : Of course, it wouldn't be too good if you ended up being the one chased either, kupo! Just take care, and good luck, kupo!
10137 : It's time once again for the Starlight Celebration!
10138 : We moogles have collected piles and piles of presents for the adventurers this time, kupo!
10139 : We'd like to give them to each person individually, but everyone always seems to be off on some adventure or another, and we can't keep them all straight! Could you help us, kupo?
10140 : Give this card to an adventurer and tell him or her to bring it to a moogle. We'll have a present waiting, kupo!
10141 : There are four cards in all. Once you hand the first card out, I will ask the adventurer who brings it back to help with the next.
10142 : You'll help us out, kupo?
10143 : Help the moogles? I'll give it a try. I have other things to do.
10144 : Oh, I just remembered! I think that the cards are all addressed to people who are wearing red...
10145 : Good luck!
10146 : If you change your mind, just let me know, kupo.
10147 : This card is addressed to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, kupo!
10148 : This card is addressed to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, kupo!
10149 : I've been waiting! I've got a present for you, kupo!
10150 : I have a request, too. I've got presents for all the other adventurers, too, but I can't find everyone. I need your help, kupo!
10151 : I need you to give this card to a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s, and have them bring it back to me, kupo!
10152 : Oh, and the person should be wearing the same red clothing you are!
10153 : I'll wait here and get the present ready! Thanks, kupo!
10154 : Did you hand out the % yet, kupo? If you forgot who to give it to, just bring it to a moogle and you'll get a reminder.
10155 : You forgot who to give the % to? Find a [warrior/monk/white mage/black mage/red mage/thief/paladin/dark knight/beastmaster/bard/ranger/samurai/ninja/dragoon/summoner] with a level range in the #s and hand it over, kupo!
10156 : You can only hand out one card a day, kupo!
10157 : Love is in the air! It's time for Valentione's Day celebrations, kupo!
10158 : There is an amazing type of chocolate whose filling is influenced by your feelings! When chocolate halves from a boy and a girl are matched together, the resulting whole produces a wonderful taste if the couple is meant to be, kupo!
10159 : Young men and women in this town have broken their chocolates in two, hoping to meet that special someone!
10160 : We want adventurers to help each of them find their perfect match, kupo!
10161 : Here's what you should do, kupo: Take the two halves of a piece of chocolate from a Valentione Single.
10162 : There are four lonely guys and four forlorn girls who need your matchmaking expertise. Try talking to someone of the same gender as you, kupo!
10163 : When they hand over their chocolate halves, the singles will give you hints about the type of person they're head-over-heels for, kupo.
10164 : You should be able to find an adventurer of the opposite gender who is holding a chocolate half from the perfect paramour for your Valentione Single.
10165 : Trade the right halves of the chocolates with your adventuring colleagues and try to match them with the left half you received from the Valentione Single.
10166 : When matching the halves, the single who gave up the left half may also meet the preferences of the single who gave up the right half.
10167 : If both the singles meet each other's preferences, you'll have a match made in heaven, kupo!
10168 : Don't forget who you got your chocolate from! Try to do too many things at once and you'll end up confused, so we suggest you hand in the chocolate halves to a moogle one pair at a time, kupo.
10169 : We moogles can take your lonely pieces and make them into one whole, complete chocolate!
10170 : Then all you have to do is return the finished chocolate to the person who gave you the original piece. One bite will tell them if they've found their perfect partner!
10171 : After you've returned a whole chocolate to four Valentione Singles, return to a moogle and collect your reward, kupo!
10172 : While you're playing matchmaker, you might meet someone who puts a sparkle in your eye, too. Kupohoho!
10173 : Or maybe you could take advantage of this romantic occasion and make a party with that special someone while you exchange chocolates, kupopopo!
10174 : Want to try again? Match up all the lovebirds you can, kupo!
10175 : Something wrong, kupo?
10176 : Something wrong? Listen to the rules again. Give up. Not really.
10177 : Four people hold the chocolates you seek. Make them into four whole chocolates and give one to each person. When you're finished, return to a moogle, kupo!
10178 : You aren't planning on giving up, are you?
10179 : Quit the game? Yes. Not yet.
10180 : If you want to start over, you'll have to get rid of the chocolates you have now.
10181 : Really give up? Yes! No, not yet!
10182 : Just think of all those poor singles! You'll come back and help them later, won't you, kupo? You should get rid of your chocolates in a subtle manner, so that you don't hurt anyone's feelings! ...We wouldn't want you getting a stomachache either, now would we, kupo?
10183 : You've managed to gather complementary pieces of chocolate! Wait just a moment, now...
10184 : ...
10185 : Kupopopo! What a beautiful piece of chocolate! No need to thank me, now. Hurry and give it to the Valentione Single!
10186 : Great work, kupo! You delivered chocolates to everyone! I've been getting lots of feedback about it! The response has been...
10187 : Excellent! I thought my heart was going to flutter out of my furry little chest--you score # [point/points]! The power of love is amazing, kupo!
10188 : Decent. You score # [point/points]. Everyone seems relatively happy! Not bad, kupo.
10189 : Well, let's just say that some things just weren't meant to be. You score # [point/points]. Sorry, but I won't hand out a reward this time, kupo.
10190 : My bag is filled with goodies for helpful adventurers like yourself! Take your pick!
10191 : Which item would you like? Let me think. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %.
10192 : Are you absolutely sure, kupo?
10193 : You really want %? Yes, that's the one! On second thought...
10194 : You must wait a bit longer to try again, kupo.
10195 : You have to throw away all of your chocolates before playing again, kupo! It might seem a waste, but a rule is a rule!
10196 : Oh, I've been waiting for this moment! You'll help me find my perfect woman, right? Wow, thank you!!!
10197 : I really like [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! They're fantastic! Here's a piece of chocolate. I hope you bring back the best chocolate ever! Good luck!
10198 : You still haven't brought any chocolate? I've been waiting so long for this, so hurry up!
10199 : Hey, what do you want? You could go see a moogle or something!
10200 : <gasp>! Y-you brought me a chocolate! I'm going to savor its delicate flavor...and then I'll let you know what I think! Thank you!
10201 : Hey. I heard you're playing the matchmaker around here.
10202 : Hmph, guess I might as well let you know my type. I like [Humes/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra], and I like 'em [cheerful/kind/shy/modest]. I leave this chocolate, and my future, in your hands. Well, go on. Get on with it.
10203 : What? Still...? Oh well, keep it up. Looking forward to the results.
10204 : What do you want? I don't think I know you.
10205 : Well, you were able to get a finished chocolate after all. I need some time to think, though. After all, this could determine my future, so I will taste it later. Thank you.
10206 : I have been waiting all my life for this! You'll match me up with a girl, right? Wow! Me and a girl, together! Imagine!
10207 : Oh, oh, let's see...I'll tell you exactly what I want! I want a [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! She also must cook things like steamed catfish every night, love watching Ballista, and have an interest in airship mechanics...er, ignore those last few requests. Anyway, here's some chocolate! Go get me a woman!
10208 : Oh wow, thanks for doing this for me! I can't wait for my chocolate!
10209 : What? What do you need? Nothing? Okay, then!
10210 : Wooow, you really got a chocolate for me! I'll let you know how it tastes later! Oh, thank you, thank you! I hope you can get a real, live [girlfriend/boyfriend] someday, too!
10211 : N-no way! I can meet...a woman? One that...likes me!? ...Oh, wow!
10212 : Okay, okay...I'm going to tell you my type. Let's see...I'd like an, um...ack, this is so embarrassing. I'd like a [cheerful/kind/shy/modest] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Mithra]! Y-yes, that's my order! (Oops...maybe I went too far just now...) Anyway, h-here's a chocolate!
10213 : Ahhh! By Altana, you scared me! Not finished yet? O-oh, I'm sorry!
10214 : What!? ...Oh, you want something? I-I'm fine!
10215 : Ahhh! You really got a chocolate for me! B-but, I don't see anywhere I could eat it now! I'll have to tell the moogle what I think later. Wow, this is great! See ya!
10216 : Hiya! I've been waiting for you, sugar! Going to find a real sweetheart for me, are you? Yay!
10217 : Listen closely, now! I liiike...[cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boys! Teeheehee! Here's a chocolate! Doesn't it look yummy? Good luck!
10218 : What's wrong, pumpernickel? Not having trouble, are we? I really want a man, so please hurry up!
10219 : Hm? Want something? You should go talk to a moogle!
10220 : Oh, I've been waiting! I wonder what it tastes like! I'll let you know what I think later. Thank you so much!
10221 : Why, hello! This looks like quite an exciting event, doesn't it? I hope I can also meet a nice guy.
10222 : [Cheerful/Cool-headed/Honest/Shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] guys are just my type. Here's a chocolate. You have my support! I wish you the best of luck!
10223 : Hello! You seem to be working very hard. I'm really thankful! But you needn't rush around so fast. Take your time! I can wait if it makes the job easier for you!
10224 : Yes? You have a question? Oh, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong person, but don't worry about it!
10225 : Wow, you brought back a finished chocolate! Thank you so much! I wonder what it tastes like. Teeheehee, I can't wait to try it. I hope you meet someone special, too!
10226 : Aaah! Oh...hi! Um, today is...and I...well, that is... <sigh> I can't bring myself to say it!
10227 : Well, here goes nothing. I want [a cheerful/a cool-headed/an honest/a shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] boyfriend! A-and here's a chocolate... Th-thank you! (I can't believe I just said that!)
10228 : Eep! Oh, y-you haven't brought a chocolate back yet? You really scared me, you know! Anyway, good luck!
10229 : Y-yes? What is it? I...um, I don't need anything...
10230 : What? Th-this...could it be? You got me a chocolate! I can't eat it here, though...that would be sooo embarrassing. But I will eat it later, so thank you!
10231 : Hello... I may not look like much, but I do hope to meet a nice guy...
10232 : I really like [cheerful/cool-headed/honest/shy] [Hume/Elvaan/Tarutaru/Galkan] men. Please take this chocolate. It may not be the best in the world, but I hope you can use it to find someone.
10233 : You're not finished with the chocolate yet, are you? I knew it would be hard to find someone for a girl like me...
10234 : What's the matter? I don't think there's anything I need...
10235 : I see you got a chocolate for me. I can't tell how good it will be until I taste it, but maybe there's hope for me after all. Thanks so much for helping me.
10236 : Come and celebrate the Doll Festival with us, kupo!
10237 : We've got items for everyone! Here you go, kupo!
10238 : Come again and bring your friends! Each of them will also get an item, kupo!
10239 : You can get items only once each day, so come back again tomorrow, kupo!
10240 : You obtain # ), # ), # ), and # )!
10241 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords, kupo!
10242 : The villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
10243 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created a weapon that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans! Behold the wondrous %, kupo!
10244 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
10245 : But be warned--this magic has the side-effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole days, kupo!
10246 : Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
10247 : If you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip the % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
10248 : Kupopo! The Sunbreeze Festival's main event is back and better than ever!
10249 : And this time, it's called Azimuth Circle...II!
10250 : Would you like to know more, kupo?
10251 : Want to know more? Fill me in! I'm okay for now, kupo.
10252 : To play Azimuth Circle II, you'll need to team up with a partner and use a compass to search for a specific point.
10253 : So your first step is to find that special somebody and form a party!
10254 : Then talk to an event moogle, and we'll send you both out of town, kupo!
10255 : We've set up several checkpoints outside.
10256 : The goal is to find the correct one, kupo!
10257 : What's that? You want a hint to help you find your checkpoint? Never fear, kupo--that's where Azima's portable compass comes in!
10258 : And it couldn't be easier to use! All the adventurers have to do is sit there and wait!
10259 : Once the compass has stabilized, it will give you a hint to help you find your partner's checkpoint, kupo.
10260 : But be careful not to relax too much! Just sitting there staring at the clouds won't help you at all, kupo. You have to concentrate the way you do when healing your wounds!
10261 : And keep in mind that you will only learn about your partner's checkpoint.
10262 : So help each other out and nothing should go wrong!
10263 : Once you reach your checkpoint, you should find something buried there that will prove that you made it! You and your partner should trade your items with each other and then hand them to a moogle, kupo!
10264 : That's all there is to it, kupo! You'll get a prize if you succeed, so I hope you do well!
10265 : You'll need a partner, so come back when you have one!
10266 : Three makes a crowd, kupo! I'm looking for parties of two, and no more!
10267 : Do you want to go outside and try the event with the person you're in a party with now?
10268 : Is this partner okay with you? Perfect! I want to go with someone else...
10269 : Come back when you've decided on a partner, kupo!
10270 : Kupo? Where'd your partner go?
10271 : I hope you enjoy the event together, kupo! When both of you are ready, just talk to one of us moogles to start!
10272 : I'll be waiting here, so just let me know when you're prepared, kupo.
10273 : Kupopo! Congratulations! You were wonderful together! This is all yours now, kupo...
10274 : Kupo? This isn't your partner's item! Trade with your partner first, and give their item to me!
10275 : We're just waiting on your partner now, kupo! Or would you like to cancel your participation?
10276 : Your partner isn't ready yet, kupo. I'll wait, though.
10277 : It looks like your partner doesn't want to go yet. Just let me know when your partner is ready, kupo.
10278 : Are you ready now, kupo?
10279 : Leave town? Send me out! Not yet...
10280 : Oh, you're both wearing yukata! You must be ready for a real challenge, kupo! Don't worry, though--the prize is worth it!
10281 : Kupo? That's not the partner you were with before! Changing partners in the middle of the game is against the rules, kupo.
10282 : If you want to play with a different person, you should talk to one of us moogles and start the game over!
10283 : I can only give each person one item a day!
10284 : Later, I'll check to make sure you both found your checkpoints. I'll also give you this gate glyph so you can return to town, kupo!
10285 : Kupo? You already have %...
10286 : Kupo! I almost forgot the most important thing of all! Here, take this!
10287 : The moogle hands % a small compass made from scintillant ore.
10288 : If you both manage to find your checkpoints, I'll give you a reward... So do your best, kupo!
10289 : What? You found a doll, kupo? Then trade it with your partner and give it to one of us moogles!
10290 : Sorry, but if you don't reach the checkpoint yourself, I can't give out a reward, kupo...
10291 : Looks like you weren't successful... Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...
10292 : Better luck next time, right, kupo? I'll take the compass back now...
10293 : % returns the compass to the moogle.
10294 : You know what to do now--get right back on your feet and try again! Just let me know if you're feeling up for it, kupo.
10295 : What is it? Do you want to start over?
10296 : Start over? Yes, please. No thanks.
10297 : Are you spreading joy to the children of Vana'diel? Hey, I can tell you something you should know!
10298 : Listen close, now! To make the children happy you must...give them presents! You should think hard about what to get them! You might say it's the thought that counts, but unfortunately, the children think otherwise!
10299 : You should also wear a red hat like the one I have on now! It'll prove you're a smilebringer, so the kids won't think you're a creep.
10300 : Where can you find a hat? Well, I saw someone selling them around here earlier. I'm sure you can find them if you look!
10301 : [You haven't brought any happiness to the children!/You've done some good./You have done fairly well./You have given the children much joy!/You have brought smile upon smile to the children!/You have the children bursting with glee!/The children love you!] [What a disappointment./You just need to give a little extra effort!/Keep it up!/You make a good smilebringer./Excellent work!/Stupendous job!/Even I think you're great!]
10302 : You can make good use of some of that joy you've brought to transport yourself to another nation. The children in other parts of Vana'diel need smiles, too!
10303 : Transport to another nation? Not now. Go to San d'Oria. Go to Bastok. Go to Windurst.
10304 : See ya!
10305 : Sorry, but it looks like you don't have enough joy and happiness in your life to do that. You can earn some by giving presents to children, though!
10306 : Leave this heap of future firewood to us, kupo! All we need from you is a couple cheers!
10307 : We have to run this monster out of town, kupo! The moogles will do all the work. All you have to do is cheer us along!
10308 : Bad tree! Bad tree! We won't let him get any further, kupo! Just keep cheering us on!
10309 : Thanks, everybody! Keep it up and there's no way we can lose, kupo!
10310 : 10000... 15000... 30000! The tree is gaining too much power! This doesn't look good, kupo!
10311 : Unnnnnngh... Bad tree! We won't let you get in the way of our plans this time, kupo!
10312 : Nnngahhh, kupo! I can't hold him back!
10313 : The Twinkling Treant sheds a solitary tear as it fades into nothingness...
10314 : Well, that was interesting. Who would have thought that one of our festival trees would just get up and start walking around? I'm just glad that it is all over.
10315 : However, there is something that still bothers me... It is like a dark cloud hanging over our fair city...
10316 : I've been so busy fighting treants and spreading love to the children, that it wasn't until recently that I heard the rumors of the other smilebringers...
10317 : I don't know what these imposters are cooking up, but if they are even thinking of laying a finger on the city's innocent children...
10318 : I hate to ask this of a stranger, but you look like someone I can trust. Would you please be so kind as to search out the false smilebringer and bring him to me so we can straighten this whole mess out?
10319 : You're back! Were you able to find the imposter?
10320 : You located him, but he managed to escape? Well, I guess that is better than nothing. Now that he knows we are on to him, perhaps he will cease to prey on the Kingdom's children.
10321 : I heard from another kind adventurer that the false smilebringer was passing out strange-looking boxes to the young ones... Why, for all I know, there could be live scorpions hiding in those packages, just waiting to sting the cute little button noses of all my little friends.
10322 : You don't know how much your kindness means to me. You're a little old to be my friend, but I'd like you to have this as a token of my appreciation.
10323 : Wow! That was pretty frightening. I'm all for tree's rights and everything, but once those guys start walking around my town...
10324 : Chop 'em up and toss them on the campfire, that's what I say. The only good tree is the one toasting my marshmallow.
10325 : Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you something before you interrupted me there.
10326 : There are these strange midgets running around town claiming that they're smilebringers just like me.
10327 : I've had my hands so full chasing around the walking trees that I haven't been able to investigate. How about to make up for interrupting me back there, you go and see if you can find any juicy info on the fakes?
10328 : I'll be right here protecting the fountain from any more treant attacks. Let me know the moment you've learned something worthwhile.
10329 : Who the kewpo are you, kewpo? I'm nothing doing wrong here, see? I'm smilebringing to nice boys and girls, kewpo! Move along! Move along!
10330 : Ummm... I can explaining, kewpo...
10331 : Just not today! Kew-pooooooooo!
10332 : Back at last. Did you learn anything worth my partially divided attention?
10333 : Uh-huh... So you let the thing get away... Well, I guess that's what I get for relying on an amateur. My bad, my bad.
10334 : One of my other contacts told me that the little spud was passing out some strange kind of pastry to all the kids. So far I haven't heard of any diarrhea breakouts, but the day is still young.
10335 : I guess your scaring him off will put an end to this fiasco, but we can't be one hundred percent sure. Keep your eyes out for that pest and next time don't let him escape!
10336 : What? You want something for helping me out? Well, it is the Starlight Celebration. Why not? You only get what you give, right?
10337 : Arrrg, that there walkin' tree almost stepped on me and me parrot! One step closer and I'd be makin' meself a new peg leg out of its head.
10338 : Aye, speakin' o' peg legs, there be this mighty fishy landlubber swaggerin' 'round Windurs' posin' as a smilebringer. What's that got t' do with peg legs? Arrrg, never ye mind.
10339 : Ye only needs t' concern yerself with the fact that this imposter is encroachin' on me territory
10340 : Nobody, not even Davy Jones, has the right t' drop his anchor in me harbor without me express permission.
10341 : Arrrg, ye looks like a trustworthy soul. Could ye find it in yer heart t' help out a fellow pirate in need?
10342 : I've got a bad feelin' 'bout that tree, an' I want t' be 'round if anythin' goes awry.
10343 : Arrrg, did ye find that scurvy dawg an' make 'im walk the plank?
10344 : Ye say he just up an' vanished, now do ye? Well, I guess yer not t' blame.
10345 : One of me other mateys said they saw the rotten bringer prancin' round like a puppet an' passin' out strange presents t' the kiddies.
10346 : But now that ye've frightened 'im off, the city should be safe. Here, take this bit o' plunder. Ye've earned it, matey!
10347 : Kupopopo! This is terrible! Some sneaky scoundrels have swiped the armor we brought in for the Feast of Swords...again, kupo!
10348 : As you probably already know, the villains wearing the armor are invulnerable to normal weapons! And as if that wasn't enough, they're surrounded by a powerful aura that prevents them from being attacked at all, kupo!
10349 : But never fear! Our top moogle researchers have created weapons that can injure these armor-thieving hooligans--the wondrous % and the marvelous %, kupo!
10350 : The nomad moogles have also developed a magic that will annul that anti-attack aura, so be sure to pay them a visit while wearing the weapon before you engage the enemy, kupo.
10351 : But be warned--this magic has the side effect of preventing you from attacking any other monster for three whole Vana'dielian days, kupo!
10352 : And that's not all! This time we want to make sure that the wretched thieves have a hard time coming back, kupo!
10353 : You see, even if you take one of them down, the power of the armor will slowly restore his health, and before you know it, the scoundrel will be back up to full health!
10354 : That's why we want you to plant (trade) your % or % into the ground near a fallen fiend. It will create a ward that should slow the equipment's regenerative properties, making it easier for you to defeat them again and again, kupo!
10355 : Just remember that the further away you travel from the ward, the weaker it becomes. We recommend staying in the same area for best results.
10356 : Alright. Here's your %. Now you're ready to do battle, kupo!
10357 : Oh, and you'll find that the prizes we have for you this time are even better than the last ones. You might even be one of the lucky adventurers who wins a spiffy, new... Ah, you'll just have to see it to believe it, kupo!
10358 : Now, if you want to cross swords with the invincible interlopers, equip % or % and talk to a nomad moogle, kupo!
10359 : Vana'diel is under attack by villains in our stolen samurai armor! Help the moogles in each nation defeat this menace, kupo!
10360 : We've mixed up some moogle magic to crack that aura, but you'll need to equip a special weapon to even cause a scratch, kupo! Equip, I tell you! Equiiiiiip!
10361 : Th-that %... It may be just the thing for whacking those wacky samurai! Hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
10362 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % when you've defeated one!
10363 : You'll be able to really hurt those harbingers of harm with %. Now hold still while I work my moogle magic, kupo!
10364 : Oh, just don't forget to place the ward with your % or your % when you've defeated one!
10365 : And whatever you do, don't wander too far from the area; your weary wards will weaken, kupo!
10366 : No, no, no! That % is way too sharp! Just think of the damage it will deal to the poor armor! Now go get yourself % or % and hurry back, kupo!
10367 : Well done! On to the next one, kupo!
10368 : That thief has already been weakened by a ward. Try to find one that hasn't, kupo!
10369 : Wonderful! Here's your reward, kupo! If you're still up for it, why don't you go out and whack yourself some more?
10370 : Unbelievable! Now, maybe those Far Eastern traders won't mix us up into moogle mincemeat! Here's your reward, kupo!
10371 : I-I'm speechless! We didn't think anyone could match wits with that Mithra menace! Here's your reward, kupo!
10372 : The shadow of the thief still lingers within the armor...
10373 : The thief's shadow has almost disappeared completely.
10374 : Hey [mister/lady], hold it right there! Are you an adventurer?
10375 : 'Fess up. Yes, I am. No way!
10376 : That's what I thought! Here, put this on, quick! Heheh!
10377 : No way!? B-but...this would just look so good on you! Here, take it! Heheh!
10378 : Ibwam tacks the % on you while you aren't looking...
10379 : Now you're in style! See how this badge is shaped like a wildcat's head? That's the mark of our mercenary company, Salaheem's Sentinels!
10380 : Our company is highly renowned for its excellence in the Near East, where we're officially approved by the Empire! It's just that no one there wants to joi--um, what was I saying!? Oh yes, we are currently recruiting!
10381 : We'd give a hearty welcome to a rugged adventurer like you! Hey, why don't you go tell all your friends about us? Thanks! Go on now!
10382 : Hey, listen! Listen! People are showing interest in Salaheem's Sentinels! This is fantastic!
10383 : Shhh! I don't wanna say this out loud, but the wildcat's eyes on the % will shine brightly near people who have heard about Aht Urhgan!
10384 : %! %! We're swamped with inquiries about Salaheem's Sentinels now! This is stupendous! How can I thank you!?
10385 : Yikes! The wildcat's eyes are glazed over like a fish ripe for the carving... It must be all out of juice!
10386 : Ibwam snatches up your %!
10387 : Here, I'll let you have this. It's a little present from me! You'll get a warm welcome when you come join our company in the Near East!
10388 : You obtain a %!
10389 : You're the master of promotion that everyone at our company is talking about! The next time you visit Al Zahbi, make sure you go to Salaheem's Sentinels.
10390 : %'s badge flashes brightly.
10391 : This Empire of Aht Urhgan story is shaping up to be a big scoop! Then again, I still don'taru have enough information to write on it...
10392 : Anyway, it looks like they've haggled the price down on a bunch of decommissioned ships from Bastok to use in hauling mercenaries off to Aht Urhgan...
10393 : Those giantaru scraps of metal could sink any time, not to mention the scores of dangers awaiting on the open seas! The Near East obviously cares nothing for the mercenaries' lives.
10394 : Who do you think you arrre? Yeowrrr! Isn't that from Aht Urhgan?
10395 : I heard that land has heaps of trrreasure for the taking. A fishy story if I've everrr heard one. Don't you start believing it, too.
10396 : I know you wouldn't go out in search of treasure ahead of me, but get any ideas, and I'll carrrve you into a new pickling stone for Chamama, 'kay?
10397 : That badge! It makes my hot Mithran blood boil! It looks like things are going to get interrresting soon!
10398 : Arrrgh, if only I were an adventurer! I would take off to the Near East as soon as I could!
10399 : One rrrule of the Starrr Onion Brrrigade...!
10400 : Tell a special secrrret to any adventurer you meet wearrring a special badge!
10401 : The rrrumored Salaheem's Sentinels is located in the town of Al Zahbi!
10402 : Hey chap, have ye heard? They say there be treasures in Aht Urhgan that nobody's laid eyes on as yet!
10403 : Ye hear that, Gottah? Pack yer bags, 'cause we're takin' off for the high seas!
10404 : Hi! I'm Pulonono, advanced chocobo trainer and proud member of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society!

10557 : Choose a word category ([first name/last name]). 1-letter words. 2-letter words. 3-letter words. 4-letter words. 5-letter words. 6-letter words. 7-letter words. 8-letter words. 9-letter words. 10-letter words. 11-letter words. 12-letter words. 13-letter words. 14-letter words. Return. Cancel.
10558 : Is this name okay? % %? Yes! On second thought...
10559 : That name is currently unavailable. Please try another combination.
10560 : Choose a word.(%)                               Cancel. View other options.
10563 : I can issue you a card that contains all your chocobo's important information.
10564 : If you trade the card to the chocobo matchmaking authority in Jeuno, you can match up your animal with other chocobos. You can buy a chococard for # gil.
10565 : Purchase a chococard? (# gil each) Yes. Not now.
10566 : To enter your chocobo in one of the CRA-sanctioned races, you must first receive %.
10567 : Then, simply trade that document to a CRA agent to complete the registration process.
10568 : Would you like a free form? Right away! Maybe later.
10569 : You can register a chocobo to respond to your call in the field. The chocobo will come to you when you use your %.
10570 : Your chocobo's registered data determines certain features, such as its saddle, so it is wise to re-register from time to time.
10571 : You can register a retired chocobo by trading % to me.
10572 : However, I will require a small fee.
10573 : Register a chocobo? (# gil) Yes. Not now.
10574 : I shall make the necessary preparations, then.
10575 : I will now register % to come when you call.
10576 : I require # gil for preparations.
10577 : I shall ready your chocobo, then.
10578 : You lost your %? Of all the irresponsible...
10579 : Anyway, I can give you a new %, but you're going to have to pay # gil for it.
10580 : Purchase %? (# gil) Yes. Not now.
10581 : Hm... This seems to be in great condition! We shouldn't need to do any work on it at the moment.
10582 : Hm... This %'s power to call your chocobo seems to have grown weak...
10583 : For a small fee, I can give you a new % in exchange for it if you wish.
10584 : Pay for a new whistle? (# gil) Yes, please. Not yet.
10585 : Here you go. Take good care of it.
10586 : All right... You can have this back, then.
10587 : I cannot accept a fee from you this time. The % is all I require.
10588 : Here, take this.
10589 : Are you sure that you want to stop caring for this chocobo?
10590 : Stop caring for your chocobo? Yes. No!
10591 : You will never be able to see your chocobo again. Is that okay with you?
10592 : Understood. Care of your chocobo will transfer to the stables. Do you have any last words?
10593 : What would you like to say? Nothing. I'm sorry. It's just an animal! We weren't compatible. Take good care of it.
10594 : Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. Sorry...
10595 : Is that so? That's a good attitude to have...
10596 : ... I'm disappointed in you.
10597 : I don't think it's a matter of compatibility. A chocobo is not a toy!
10598 : We will. I'm sure you have your reasons, but it's still no excuse.
10599 : Of course not! Whew, you had me frightened for a second there! Don't say such things!
10600 : You really want to retire your chocobo?
10601 : Retire your chocobo? Yes. Not yet!
10602 : Once you retire your chocobo, you won't be able to meet it anytime you want anymore. Are you okay with that?
10603 : Understood. We hope you enjoyed raising your chocobo.
10604 : Of course not! Such a decision cannot be made in haste!
10605 : Your chocobo learns Gallop!
10606 : Your chocobo learns Canter!
10607 : Your chocobo learns Burrow!
10608 : Your chocobo learns Bore!
10609 : Your chocobo learns Auto-Regen!
10610 : Your chocobo learns Treasure Finder!
10611 : I'm afraid we still aren't finished using the %, so I will have to return your item to you.
10612 : You give the % to the chocobo.
10613 : The chocobo looks like it's already full, but it's forcing itself to eat...
10614 : Your chocobo is sleeping soundly. You cannot feed it now.
10615 : Your chocobo has run away. You cannot feed it now.
10616 : You cannot feed a chocobo that has not hatched yet.
10617 : It seems like it will have some sort of effect on the chocobo...
10618 : Let me know if you have any questions about chocobo raising.
10619 : What would you like to ask about? The Vana'diel Chocobo Society. Time required. Chocobo attributes. Care schedule. Caring for your chocobo. Feed. Abilities and personality. Retirement. Matchmaking. Calling chocobos in the field. Items. Lost chicks. Nothing.
10620 : Just let me know if you ever get curious!
10621 : The Vana'diel Chocobo Society, or VCS for short, is an international organization designed to train and dispatch chocogirls and chocoguys to stables across Vana'diel.
10622 : They provide courses on practical chocobo riding and the proper ways to care for a chocobo, as well as working to improve the treatment of chocobos from here to Aht Urhgan.
10623 : Anyone can join as long as they love chocobos. The VCS will help you with anything you need.
10624 : Chicks hatch from eggs, grow into young chocobos, and finally mature.
10625 : They grow much faster than people do. Usually it takes about 1 month (Earth time) before you can ride your chocobo.
10626 : The chocobo's traits are determined by the way in which you care for your animal. Without proper planning, you won't be able to raise the type of chocobo that you want.
10627 : But don't worry, because you have us to help! We're all in this together!
10628 : Ask about which attribute? Strength. Endurance. Discernment. Receptivity. Energy. Affection. Satisfaction. Nothing.
10629 : Strength is a term used to describe the chocobo's leg power. The more strength a chocobo has, the faster it will be able to run. Rental chocobos have been raised with an emphasis on this attribute.
10630 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
10631 : Endurance is a term used to describe the chocobo's stamina. If your chocobo has high endurance, you will be able to ride it for a long period of time.
10632 : Both strength and endurance are collectively referred to as Physical attributes.
10633 : Discernment is a must for anyone who wants their chocobo to learn new abilities. You may want to consider raising this attribute if you are interested in digging for treasure.
10634 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
10635 : Receptivity is a term used to describe the chocobo's sensitivity when dealing with others. You can foster receptivity in your chocobo by giving it lots of opportunities to communicate with other chocobos.
10636 : Both discernment and receptivity are collectively referred to as Mental attributes.
10637 : Energy is a term used to describe the amount of power the chocobo needs to stay active for the day. If your chocobo has a lot of energy, care plans are more likely to be successful and you can provide more direct care for your chocobo.
10638 : You can restore your chocobo's energy by feeding it, so remember not to skip out on feeding time after a demanding schedule!
10639 : Affection is the most important attribute of all. Your care schedule will fall flat if you don't show your chocobo proper affection!
10640 : You can raise your chocobo's affection by feeding it greens and caring for it on a regular basis.
10641 : If you really want to raise your chocobo's affection quickly, you can give it %, but I can't recommend doing so unless absolutely necessary.
10642 : Satisfaction is a term used to describe how full or hungry your chocobo is. If your chocobo is full, it will gain a lot of energy before the next day.
10643 : However, when the chocobo is very hungry, its energy will hardly recover at all and its affection will rapidly decrease.
10644 : What would you like to ask about? What is a care schedule? Basic care. Resting. Taking a walk. Listening to music. Exercising alone. Exercising in a group. Interacting with children. Interacting with chocobos. Carrying packages. Exhibiting to the public. Delivering messages. Digging for treasure. Acting in a play. Nothing.
10645 : A care schedule is a series of plans that you set up for your chocobo so that we can take care of it while you are away.
10646 : How you want us to care for your chocobo each day is completely up to you.
10647 : You can register up to four plans at once, each for up to 7 days (Earth time).
10648 : When you come to check on your chocobo, we will give you a report on the results. You should listen closely to the report and use it as reference when deciding on a new schedule.
10649 : With the basic care plan, we will provide the minimum level of care for your chocobo. This plan is the most stable, and your chocobo will probably not experience any sudden changes.
10650 : The basic care plan is good for those who don't want their chocobo's traits to change much or are still unsure of what kind of schedule to choose.
10651 : You can select the basic care plan the moment you start raising your chocobo.
10652 : The rest plan's name speaks for itself. We will give your chocobo a rest in order to restore its energy and cure any status abnormalities.
10653 : However, your chocobo will not be able to eat any food you give it during the plan, because it will be in a deep sleep.
10654 : We can take your chocobo for a walk in town to improve its physical attributes of strength and endurance. However, it will have a negative effect on its mental attributes of discernment and receptivity.
10655 : Listening to music will improve your chocobo's mental attributes of discernment and receptivity. However, it will have a negative effect on its physical attributes of strength and endurance.
10656 : Exercising alone will significantly improve your chocobo's strength. On the other hand, its mental attributes will markedly decrease.
10657 : If the chocobo is strong, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo is weak, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10658 : Exercising with chocobos will build your animal's endurance. On the other hand, its mental attributes will decrease.
10659 : If the chocobo has high endurance, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo's endurance is low, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10660 : Interacting with children helps your chocobo become a more discerning creature by interacting with people.
10661 : However, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes, as no strenuous exercise is involved.
10662 : If the chocobo has good discernment, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good discernment, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10663 : Interacting with other chocobos in the field will improve the chocobo's receptivity by fostering its communication skills.
10664 : But because the focus is on communication and not exercise, this plan will have a negative effect on the chocobo's physical attributes.
10665 : If the chocobo has good receptivity, this plan is quite effective, but if the chocobo does not have good receptivity, then you shouldn't push it too hard.
10666 : You can choose to have your chocobo help deliver packages. Not only will this improve its physical attributes, but you will even receive payment for your services!
10667 : The downside is that your chocobo's mental attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo, or you might find yourself getting cold treatment.
10668 : You can choose to exhibit your chocobo to the public, which will allow anyone visiting the chocobo stables to take a look at your animal. Being the center of attention will help improve your chocobo's mental attributes.
10669 : The downside is that your chocobo's physical attributes, energy, and affection will decrease. You must care well for your chocobo afterwards. Also, you will receive payment for this service.
10670 : You can choose to have your chocobo deliver official messages for the nation. Not only will this improve its strength, but you will even receive payment for your services!
10671 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10672 : You can have your chocobo help out VCS finances by digging for treasure. This will also improve the chocobo's discernment.
10673 : The VCS will sell the item and use the money for the organization's benefit, but will provide you with payment for your services.
10674 : However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10675 : You can choose to have your chocobo act as an extra in a play to improve its receptivity.
10676 : You will receive payment in accordance with the chocobo's performance. However, this plan consumes quite a bit of your chocobo's energy, so you should feed it well to make up for it.
10677 : What would you like to ask about? A general explanation. Watching over your chocobo. Telling a story. Scolding. Competing. Taking a walk. Nothing.
10678 : In addition to setting the chocobo's schedule, you can also care directly for your chocobo whenever you like.
10679 : Caring for your chocobo will increase its affection for you.
10680 : On the other hand, a chocobo that receives too much care will lose energy more rapidly when engaging in activities. If you do nothing but care for your chocobo, it will become fatigued.
10681 : However, not caring enough for your chocobo will have a negative effect on your relationship, so it is important to find a balance.
10682 : You can watch over your chocobo whenever you like.
10683 : Your fond gaze can communicate even more than a touch and will not have a very tiring effect on the animal.
10684 : You can tell the chocobo a story you know. This will foster the animal's sensibilities.
10685 : I've heard that by listening to the story, the chocobo might even realize it has powers it never noticed before. (I've never seen it happen before, though...)
10686 : Sometimes your chocobo might start acting spoiled or refuse to do anything but sleep. In such times, you will need to firmly scold it.
10687 : This will shame the animal and have an effect on its receptivity.
10688 : Competing against other chocobos will cultivate your animal's ambitious spirit and is highly effective for bored chocobos.
10689 : You can take your chocobo out for a walk in the field. You will be able to choose more destinations as your chocobo grows.
10690 : I like to take the chocobo out often, too, but I'm sure it prefers going out with you.
10691 : Leaving the stables every once in a while allows your chocobo to experience new sights and sounds. Maybe you'll even discover something new together!
10692 : What would you like to know about? Why feeding is important. Vegetables. Wildgrasses. Carrots. Worms. Medicines. Pastes. Nothing.
10693 : Chocobos digest feed quickly, so they are often hungry.
10694 : However, they also restore energy at a rapid pace. If you do not feed your chocobo properly, it will be unable to restore enough energy.
10695 : The chocobo stables will provide your chocobo with the minimum amount of feed required for the animal to survive, but you need to provide more in order to ensure its healthy growth.
10696 : At the same time, feeding your chocobo too much can result in a stomachache. Remember to strike a balance with both the variety and quantity of feed you give to your animal!
10697 : Some types of feed have special effects, so it is important not to neglect your chocobo's diet if you want to raise a good chocobo.
10698 : There are different methods of acquiring these special types of feed, so be on the lookout for them!
10699 : Just trade the feed to an advanced chocobo trainer, and they will give it to your chocobo.
10700 : This is the standard variety of chocobo feed, among which % are most popular.
10701 : Chocobos also seem to enjoy % and %.
10702 : These greens are the most effective in satisfying a chocobo's hunger. Chocobos also enjoy the taste, which raises affection for their owner.
10703 : Wildgrasses are a type of medicinal herb. They do not taste very good, but are highly effective at curing status abnormalities.
10704 : %, for example, works well on wounds. So although they look similar to %, the effects are different.
10705 : In addition, % is effective for illness, and % for a stomachache. It's a good idea to remember which herb to use in each situation.
10706 : Carrots are high in nutrition, and will have an effect on the chocobo's strength and discernment.
10707 : %, for example, affect the chocobo's physical attributes, and % are good for its mental attributes. % are in a category of their own.
10708 : Remember, though, that the results are very slight, and keeping a good care schedule is a far more efficient way to alter your chocobo's attributes.
10709 : Using worms as feed can have a variety of effects. They might look disgusting, but their effectiveness is not to be ignored!
10710 : For example, % will dramatically increase your chocobo's affection, and % will restore its energy.
10711 : But watch out for the side effects... Give the chocobo a worm at the wrong time, and all your effort could come to nothing...
10712 : The most curious of all the worms is the %. At first it may not seem to have any effect, but looks are deceiving...
10713 : Medicines can cure a chocobo in the blink of an eye.
10714 : % will restore your chocobo's energy in full, making it easier to care for and ensuring that the care schedule goes smoothly.
10715 : % are effective for most status abnormalities, restoring instant health to your chocobo. Of course, you still need to continue caring for your chocobo so it can fully recover.
10716 : A potion can also help fill a chocobo's stomach, so they can be useful when you are short on feed.
10717 : Feed can be ground into paste for chicks to eat.
10718 : You can make paste yourself with some cooking skill. If you don't have enough cooking skill yourself, then you might want to ask a friend to make some for you.
10719 : Chicks can also eat regular feed, though.
10720 : Which would you like to ask about? Abilities. Temperament. Weather preferences. Nothing.
10721 : Your chocobo may learn useful abilities during the course of its life at the stables.
10722 : For example, Auto-Regen will increase the rate at which your chocobo restores energy. Such an ability is sure to come in handy in a variety of situations.
10723 : Your chocobo learns abilities by listening to your words, so if you know of any story that you think might interest the animal, you should tell it often.
10724 : But remember, your chocobo can't learn all of the abilities there are. It can only learn two...or at least, that's what I read.
10725 : The chocobo's temperament is determined when it is just a chick. Its temperament and attributes are somehow related, but I'm not really sure how.
10726 : Chocobos generally like sunny days, but they could grow to like other kinds of weather depending on how they are raised.
10727 : Chocobos pay attention to the air outside when they go on walks, and grow to prefer that type of weather because of the memories.
10728 : Make the animal's schedule around its preferred weather days, and plans are more likely to succeed. However, if the chocobo has a favored type of weather, it also dislikes certain conditions, creating a weak point to watch for.
10729 : You can choose to retire your chocobo at any time after it has fully matured.
10730 : After retirement, the VCS will take up caring for the chocobo where you left off, so you need not worry about its welfare.
10731 : When your chocobo retires, you will receive %. Be sure not to lose it.
10732 : You can use the % to register your chocobo to call in the field or for matchmaking purposes after retirement. All you need to do is trade it to a VCS member.
10733 : The empty stall created after your animal retires can be used for raising other chocobos, so if you happen to come across another egg, you can bring it here to start all over again!
10734 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can breed it with another chocobo. If the chocobo lays an egg, the chick will inherit the traits of its parents.
10735 : You will need % and % if you want to breed your chocobo. Apparently, you also need some kind of ticket that they sell at the stables in Upper Jeuno.
10736 : You can ask one of the VCS members to issue you a chococard, or if your chocobo is already retired, just trade them %.
10737 : I don't really know that much about it, but you should probably try matching your chocobo up with several different animals and seeing what the results are.
10738 : When your chocobo is mature enough, you can call it in the field using %.
10739 : You need to let a member of the VCS know which chocobo you want to respond to your call, because they must choose a saddle that fits your chocobo's attributes.
10740 : That also means that when your chocobo's attributes change or it learns a new ability, you should probably let the VCS member know, too.
10741 : When you want to register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field, trade % to a VCS member.
10742 : Also, the %'s power will grow weak after you've used it several times.
10743 : If this happens, just trade it to a VCS member and they will give you a new one for a fee.
10744 : What would you like to ask about? %. Chococards. %. Nothing.
10745 : % proves that you are your chocobo's caretaker.
10746 : With this card, you can register a retired chocobo to respond to your call in the field or get a chococard for matchmaking.
10747 : If you lose it, you won't be able to get another one, so keep it in a safe place!
10748 : You can use % to call your chocobo in the field to use as a mount.
10749 : The more you use it, the weaker it will get, so eventually you will need to exchange it to a VCS member for a new one.
10750 : Only people who have been approved by the VCS President can get %, so good luck with that...
10751 : Chococards are documents that contain all the details about a chocobo's attributes and condition. They are divided into two types--one for each gender.
10752 : If you trade one to the person who's in charge of matchmaking, he'll introduce your animal to another chocobo.
10753 : Chococards contain information on the chocobo's attributes and condition at the time the card is issued, so be sure to get a new card before using this service or the match will be arranged based on out-of-date information.
10754 : If you want a chococard for a retired chocobo, then you must trade % to a VCS member.

10929 : That should be enough. Let me see the % now.
10930 : should be able to sleep well with this.
10931 : Thanks to the %,  has been sleeping soundly at night.

10951 : You would like to tend to this egg?
10952 : We will provide it with the best of care, then... Let us make a fine chocobo out of this egg.
10953 : A chick has hatched from the egg!

10961 : And I must say,  seems quite satisfied. You have raised one fine animal.
10962 : But, %... You still haven't named it.
10963 : Well then, I shall give the poor animal a name. From now on, your chocobo will be known as...
10965 : Your chocobo seems to like its new name.
10966 : I am terribly sorry, but it looks like the time has come to part with your chocobo.  will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society farms.
10967 : Do not fret; this will not be your last meeting.
10968 : will come to you whenever you call.
10969 : is injured, but I am sure it would heal quickly if we had %.
10970 : 's injury has completely healed.
10971 : seems to be a bit under the weather. % should fix it right up, though.
10972 : 's illness has completely healed.
10973 : seems to have a stomachache. Are you giving it a proper diet?
10974 : seems to have a stronger stomach these days.
10975 : seems lonely. You should venture out together sometime.
10976 : no longer seems lonely.
10977 : ...Oho, you are not afraid that it has stopped caring about you, are you?
10978 : I am not sure what to say to that!
10979 : seems quite perky lately. It should be responsive to anything you give it now.

10992 : is back, and I am pleased to say it seems to be fine.
10993 : I know you were worried, but you should give it a warm welcome. It must have missed you terribly.
10994 : has been acting strange lately. Its head is in the clouds and it does not seem to have much of an appetite...

11015 : has had quite a workout! I would say its speed has somewhat improved.

11017 : has been out playing with the children of San d'Oria. Even I felt like a kid again!

11081 : You are interested in entering your chocobo into competitions? Strange...there were three others who mentioned the same thing.
11082 : Well, it is good for their physical development, after all. I suppose it is acceptable as long as they do not fight.

11090 : Exercising alone will improve your chocobo's strength, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.
11091 : Exercising in a group will improve your chocobo's stamina, but will have a slightly negative effect on its mental condition.

11105 : What is this? Are you telling me that you no longer want to raise this chocobo?
11106 : You would not want to stop raising the poor animal at a time like this, would you?
11107 : Give up? Yes, I can't do it anymore. No, I want to continue.
11108 : You just started raising the poor creature! You are absolutely sure you want to do this?
11109 : Fine. Then you will never see your chocobo again. Is that all right with you?
11110 : If you decide to stop raising , you will never see it again. Are you really willing to give up without even seeing its face one last time?
11111 : Give up raising your chocobo? Yes. No!
11112 : Fine. Then the stables shall raise this egg. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
11113 : Fine. Custody of this chocobo will be transferred to the stables. Is there anything you wish to say before you are parted?
11114 : Fine. When  returns, the stables will begin caring for it. Do you have anything you wish to say?
11115 : What would you like to say? Nothing. I'm sorry. It's just an animal! We weren't compatible. Take good care of it.
11116 : Is that so? I guess this is hard on you too, then. I apologize...
11117 : Is that so? That is a proper attitude...
11118 : ... I am disappointed in you.
11119 : You have not even seen its face yet, have you? Once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.
11120 : No matter how incompatible you feel you may be, once you decide to raise an animal, you should see it through to the end.
11121 : We will. I am sure you have your reasons, but it still becomes no excuse.
11122 : I see. May you always continue to care for your chocobo!
11123 : You cannot retire a chocobo that has not been named.
11124 : Are you sure you want to retire ?
11125 : Retire ? Yes. Not yet!
11126 : Once you retire , you will become unable to meet it whenever you want. You have no qualms with this?
11127 : Really retire your chocobo? Yes, really! No, I've changed my mind!
11128 : Understood. Then the chocobo will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's stables. Now is the time to say your goodbyes.
11129 : Understood. It will be transferred to one of the Vana'diel Chocobo Society's farms as soon as it returns.

11734 : You're lucky our chocobo wasn't feeling that well today. You would be eating our dust any other time!
11735 : This would never have happened if Bashraf hadn't been telling the chocobo those foolish stories...
11736 : That's not true! The chocobo always looked very interested in what I had to say!
11737 : I'm sure your chocobo would be, too. You should give it a try sometime!
11738 : Now have you learned never to underestimate ?
11739 : This baby's going to earn us a mint at the races! As for you...at this rate, you'll need all the luck you can get to even earn the right to compete with me!
11740 : It's a tie!
11741 : Hey, your chocobo isn't half bad...
11742 : Hmph. If  had only been feeling up to it, we would have been here hours ago!
11743 : Luck was simply not with us today...
11744 : Well, hello there! You're out on a walk with your chocobo today, too?
11745 : Your chocobo is adorable, isn't it? It should get along with  just fine!
11746 : Cheep!
11747 : Keh!
11748 : Kweh!
11749 : becomes friends with !
11750 : Oh, you're out walkin' your chocobo, too?
11751 : Mighty fine specimen ya got there. Let's see how well it gets along with  here...
11752 : You're out on a walk with your chocobo, too?
11753 : Nice-looking chocobo. Let's see how well it gets along with %...
11754 : Good day to you, [Sir/Ma'am]! Fine day to walk a chocobo.
11755 : I must say, that is a fine specimen. I am curious to see how it would get along with my ...
11756 : Hey! You're raising a chocobo, too?
11757 : Take a look at our chocobo. Is it not a splendid creature?
11758 : What'd you mean, why are all three of us raising one chocobo? Like an amateur would understand!
11759 : We're aiming to raise the best of the best...the creme de la creme of all chocobos!
11760 : Bashraf is fostering its psychological state.
11761 : Foudeel is working on its intelligence.
11762 : And I'm making it the strongest chocobo in Vana'diel!
11763 : Brilliant, right? What better way to raise a perfect animal than to divide the tasks and focus on each aspect wholeheartedly?
11764 : Sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but our chocobo is far superior to yours.
11765 : Do you not agree? Surely you would not have the nerve to suggest that your chocobo is...dare I say...better than ours?
11766 : But if you insist, a simple race will make the difference in quality quite clear. Try it if you still have any complaints, and may the best chocobo win.
11767 : Hey, I remember you!
11768 : I'm glad you're taking the time to take  out for fresh air. Keep up the good work!
11769 : Oh, there you are!
11770 : Glad to see you're taking  out on walks! Keep it up!
11771 : Well, what a coincidence.
11772 : I'm glad to see that you're taking  outside every now and then. Keep up the good work.
11773 : Well, well! Fine meeting you here, %.
11774 : I am pleased to see that you are taking  outside every now and then. I hope you continue the fine work.
11775 : You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo!
11776 : Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important!
11777 : Let me teach you a story that I often recite to my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too!
11778 : You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo...
11779 : Don't forget just how important regular communication with your chocobo is.
11780 : Let me teach you a story that I often recite to my chocobo. You should tell it to your chocobo, too.
11781 : You should be starting to realize about now just how hard it is to raise a chocobo.
11782 : Don't forget that regular communication with your chocobo is important.

11787 : Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with . Keep it up, okay?
11788 : Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with . Keep up the good work, ya hear?
11789 : Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with . Keep it up.
11790 : Your chocobo seems to be getting along well with . Keep it up.
11791 : Well, hello! I haven't seen you in forever. Is that your own chocobo?
11792 : Ever since you showed me the error of my ways, I've been goin' to meet my old chocobo practically every day now. I know Brutus's takin' good care of him, but I just can't help but wonder how he's doing.
11793 : Today when I went to the stables, Brutus was just about to take him out on a walk.
11794 : But when he saw me, he came runnin' over!
11795 : It looked like he wanted me to take him out...
11796 : Kweh!
11797 : Anyway, I'm glad he's happy. Don't you make the same mistakes I did, now.
11798 : Cheep!
11799 : Kwee!
11800 : Kweh!
11801 : Cheep.
11802 : The chocobo appears to be lost...
11803 : The chocobo chick appears to be lost...
11804 : What will you do? Bring it home. Leave it.
11805 : Cheep...
11806 : The chocobo chick follows %...
11807 : You look like you have something you want to ask. What do you want?

11814 : I thought about it a while, and remembered something else...
11815 : It's been on my mind, but I haven't been able to remember anything else yet.
11816 : You look like you have something you would like to ask. Is there something wrong?
11817 : I see... So, you are searching for the owner of a lost chick? This is simply conjecture, but...
11818 : I saw somebody walking a chick not too long ago.

11833 : It's been on my mind, but I haven't been able to remember anything else yet. Sorry!
11834 : You look like you've got a burning question on your mind. What's wrong?

11845 : The owner is [an Elvaan man/an Elvaan woman/an old Elvaan man/an old Elvaan woman/a Galka/a Hume woman/a Hume man/an old Hume woman/a Tarutaru man/a Tarutaru woman/a Mithra].

11848 : appears to have found something.
11849 : You see something half-buried under the straw. Could it be %...?
11850 : You find something on the floor of the chocobo stall. Could it be %...?
11851 : Ah, it appears your chocobo found this during one of your walks.
11852 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
11853 : Looks like your chocobo found this on one of your walks.
11854 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
11855 : It seems your chocobo found this on one of your walks.
11856 : Chocobos like to give things they've picked up to their parents...which would be you in this case.
11857 : Obtained: %!
11858 : Inventory is full. % could not obtain the %.
11859 : Could not trade the % and %. Please try again.
11860 : Hear the report? Hear a detailed report. Hear a brief report. Skip the report. I'm done here.
11861 : Are you sure? Yes. No.
11862 : Continue the report? Please do. I've heard enough.
11863 : Skip all remaining reports? No. Yes.
11864 : One moment please...
11865 : Choose the pace for your [short walk/regular walk/long walk]. Leisurely. Brisk. Cancel.
11866 : You've got my chocobo, eh?
11867 : Thanks a million! That birrrd is so cute, she reminds me of myself. I was afraid someone had kidnapped the poor little chickadee.
11868 : Hey, you're raising a chocobo too, rrright? Let me tell you a story you might be able to use!
11869 : You've got my chocobo?
11870 : I've taught the little guy beforehand what to do if he meets up with a monster, so I was prrretty sure he'd be okay, but I was still a little worried.
11871 : Thanks for finding him. Let me thank you by teaching you a story your chocobo might like...
11872 : What? You've got my chocobo!?
11873 : You know, looking at these lifeless Cardians all the time makes me yearn for flesh-and-blood companionship all the more.
11874 : You're raising a chocobo too, right? Let me teach you a story to show my gratitude...
11875 : My chocobo's in your care, is she?
11876 : Oh, how should I thanky you? A friendy for life? A million-billion hugs? ...I know! How about a story to tell your chocobo?
11877 : Cardians and chocobos... They're both fantastically fantastic!
11878 : You've got my chocobo!?
11879 : I couldn't find the little puffball no matter how harrrd I looked for him. I was sure he was filling the belly of some black-hearted monster about now!
11880 : Thank you! You're rrraising a chocobo too, right? I know a good story you can use...
11881 : You've got me chocobo!?
11882 : Me feathered mate is livin' in safety, then? I've neverrr heard such happy tidin's! I'll be sure to watch the little fella close from now on!
11883 : Let me show me grrratitude by tellin' you a story I often tell me little mate...
11884 : You've rrreally got my chocobo?
11885 : Terrrific! Ever since the little bird flew the coop, I haven't been able to concentrate on my work at all. I was afraid I'd never get out of that rrrut.
11886 : Let me tell you a nice story to show you just how thankful I am...
11887 : Well, well, well... You've found my little bundle of joy!?
11888 : Oh, thank you! To show my gratitude, let me teach you a story I often tell my chocobo...
11889 : Hm... What kind of clothes should I make for her next?
11890 : You say you've got my chocobo, eh?
11891 : You rrreally think I'd believe that? I know you just wanted to get close to me, but surely you can think of something better than that!
11892 : You say you've got my chocobo?
11893 : A rrranger like me would never lose sight of her chocobo!
11894 : You've got my chocobo?
11895 : Whenever I take my chocobo on a walk, I also bring along a Cardian to make sure nobody gets lost! I'm afraid you've got the wrong guy.
11896 : You say you've got my chocobo?
11897 : I may not be able to animatey a Cardian yet, but I have confidencey in my chocobo-raising skills! You must have the wrong person.
11898 : You say you've got my chocobo?
11899 : I'm a rrranger, so I know how terrifying monsters can be. I would never take my eyes off a poor defenseless chocobo while we're on a walk! You must have the wrrrong person.
11900 : You say you've got me chocobo?
11901 : I'm afraid you've got the wrong person. Adventurers are bound to make mistakes from time to time, so don't let it get you down, mate.
11902 : Sorry, but you've got the wrong gal. I'd never be able to work this well if my prrrecious chocobo was missing!
11903 : Well, well, well... You think you've found my chocobo, do you?
11904 : Sorry to tell you, but it can't be mine. I was just playing dress-up with my chocobo just a few moments ago!
11905 : Out of all the darrrn Mithras in this darrrn town, you decided to talk to me... Well, then I must say you are off to a good start.
11906 : You're looking at the highest-ranking mid-level journeyman in the VCS. You don't know what that means? It doesn't matter. All that matters is what I'm about to offer you...
11907 : Treasure, matey! Gil with a capital G. Rrrich stuff so rrrich you'll have to hide it in your underwear if you want to keep it safe.
11908 : Okay, let's back up a bit. You've noticed the rrrecent influx of chocobo owners these past few moons, right?
11909 : Well, all those extra birds have the local trainers busier than bees at a honey convention.
11910 : I've started hearing rumors that a lot of the stables don't have time to give proper attention to all the chocobos in their care, leaving a lot of the birds weak and hungrrry.
11911 : (One guy even told me that the stables here have been selling extra birds to the Timbre Timbers...if you know what I mean!)
11912 : Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is, that if we don't do something quick, Vana'diel will be crawling with chocobos so weak and slow, people will start riding rarabs instead.
11913 : And that brings me back to why the VCS sent me here--treasure!
11914 : And what does treasure have to do with saving chocobos? Everything! After about fifty-seven meetings, the VCS officials came up with a brrrand-new activity to get your chocobo in shape, while lining your pockets with sweet loot!
11915 : And it's called the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game!
11916 : You love your chocobo? You love money? Well, then why not love them both at the same time by participating in this new fad that's sweeping the continent by storm?
11917 : You look like you've got some time on your hands. Why not give the game a whirl? You have nothing to lose!
11918 : We guarantee you'll have fun or your money back! Oh, and did I mention it's frrree to participate?
11919 : VCS officials have been spending the past few weeks burying chests filled with tasty treats in secrrret locations all over Vana'diel.
11920 : All you have to do is dig 'em up, and they're yours. No strings attached!
11921 : What do you say?
11922 : Yeah, you could go out and help some lady get her husband ointment to soothe his festerrring pustules, or defeat some Shadow Lord and save the world, but deep down in your heart you know what you really want to do...
11923 : Listen to your heart? Sign me up! After saving the world.
11924 : Alright, I guess everybody has their priorities. But you know where I'll be when you're finished!
11925 : Rrright answer!
11926 : Wait a minute... Let me see your map collection... You don't have the complete three-nation set, do you?
11927 : I'm talking about the %, the %, and the %.
11928 : I'm sorry, but you'll need all three before I can let you play our game. Stop by a map vendor and pick up the ones you don't have. I'll be waiting here for you, but I can't guarantee the treasure will be...
11929 : Okay, now I know you're all rrready to get started, but I'm required to go over the official VCS rulebook before letting you loose.
11930 : What do you need to know? About chocographs. About %. About how to find the loot. About chocobo abilities. About when the game is over.
11931 : Anyone who wants to participate in the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game will require a special chocograph authorizing [him/her] to dig in a cerrrtain area.
11932 : There are several kinds of chocographs for different types of treasure hidden in areas all over Vana'diel.
11933 : And once you obtain one, it's yours for life, or until you set your gobbiebag on fire.
11934 : Wait... I'm picking up your thoughts... Just where do I get my hands on a chocograph?
11935 : Well, don't you worry, because for a limited time, the VCS is giving away two chocographs absolutely frrree to the first three million adventurers who sign up!
11936 : % is the item that you'll need to start the game.
11937 : Take a clump to the area specified on a chocograph and set it out on the ground. Before you know it, your verrry own chocobo will come galloping gallantly to your side.
11938 : Once it arrives, your map will open and you'll have the opportunity to confirm the general location of the burrried treasure in that area.
11939 : Please note that once your chocobo has gobbled up the %, you'll need to obtain another from a VCS representative before playing again.
11940 : Ah yes... I knew you'd want to hear about that. Well, first ride your chocobo out to the location indicated on your map.
11941 : When you think you're close to where the treasure might be buried, take a test dig and see what happens.
11942 : All chocobos have noses for finding burrried goods, and depending on how hot or cold you are (Get it? That's where we got the name for the game!) your steed will react differently.
11943 : The closer you are, the more drrramatic that reaction will be, so listen carefully.
11944 : When you think you've found the spot...
11945 : ...dig and dig, and then dig some more!
11946 : I'll warn you right now, but some of the loot is pretty deep, so you may have to dig multiple times beforrre you uncover any chests.
11947 : But, with a little bit of luck and a lot of bits of persistence, you'll be rolling in goodies in no time!
11948 : That's rrright! Once you've unearthed the chest, all that's left is to open it. Whatever you find inside is yours to keep.
11949 : Now, to increase your chances of finding treasure, you'll want to know how chocobo abilities can give you that extrrra edge.
11950 : The ones that will help you most are Treasure Finder, Burrow, and Bore.
11951 : Burrow and Bore will allow you to go deeper with each dig, helping you reach the chest beforrre your bird grows too tired.
11952 : Treasure Finder does just that--helps you find the treasure easierrr by honing your chocobo's sense of smell.
11953 : Alright, this part is the most important, so I'm going to need you to listen up.
11954 : Digging for extended periods of time can rrreally drain a chocobo's strength.
11955 : Push your bird too harrrd, and it may just reach that point where it refuses to dig anymore.
11956 : When this happens, you might as well tighten the string on your gobbiebag because you won't be getting any morrre treasure that day.
11957 : In other words, locating the chest in the fewest possible digs will be the key to your success.
11958 : Remember that.
11959 : Okay! Now I think you're finally rrready to head out there and start digging!
11960 : Let me get you your two complimentary licenses...
11961 : Here's a % and a %.
11962 : And here's your %.
11963 : Like I told you before, too much digging is hard on your chocobo, so the VCS prohibits me from giving adventurers too many of these %.
11964 : If you want any more, let your chocobo rest a while beforrre coming back, alright?
11965 : Okay. I can tell that you've heard enough from me.
11966 : You're frrree to go! Talk to you later!
11967 : Step rrright up, boys and girls! I can give you IX finally fantastic reasons why the Chocobo Hot and Cold Game is the most fun you'll have on the back of a giant yellow bird!
11968 : So, what do you need? A rule refresher course. Another dose of Hot and Cold. Nothing.
11969 : Sure! Here's a new % for you.
11970 : Now what are you waiting for? Get hunting!
11971 : How's the digging going? You find anything interrresting?
11972 : If you came for another % then you're out of luck.
11973 : You'll have to let your chocobo rest a little more before I can give you any morrre.
11974 : Do you need to review the rules? Yes. No.
11975 : Step rrright up and take part in the most fantastical game to ever be played on Vana'diel.
11976 : Let me get you started with one of these--
11977 : Oh, I see you already have %.
11978 : You'll have to use that one before I can give you anotherrr. Thank you, come again!
11979 : You like digging? I know you do! I can see the shovels in your eyes! Step rrright up and--
11980 : Wait a minute, you don't currently have a chocobo in the stables, do you?
11981 : Well, then what are you waiting for? Get breeding! Come on, go, go, go!
11982 : You being press the button now!
11983 : And would you look at this! My rrrecords show that you've uncovered some of our prairie treasure.
11984 : And would you look at this! My rrrecords show that you've uncovered some of our treasure hidden in the bush.
11985 : A little too easy for you, huh? Let me guess...you're hankering for a new challenge. Don't try to hide it! I can see those shovels in yourrr eyes.
11986 : Well, this is yourrr day, %. I have a brand-spanking-new % with yourrr name on it!
11987 : With this baby, you'll be able to dig to yourrr heart's content all across the Valkurm Dunes.
11988 : With this baby, you'll be able to dig to yourrr heart's content all across the Buburimu Peninsula.
11989 : The treasure may be a little harderrr to find this time around, but you should have no problem at all! Good luck!
11990 : Well, I'll be a kitten in a cantina. My rrrecords show that you and your trusty bird have been tearing up the Buburimu Peninsula lately.
11991 : Well, I'll be a tigress in a teahouse. My rrrecords show that you and your trusty bird have been tearing up the Valkurm Dunes lately.
11992 : It's like I've been telling everybody, That %'s a natural!
11993 : And that's why I'm going to present you with this rrrare, first-edition chocograph for the Yuhtunga and Yhoator Jungles!
11994 : Before you go, let me give you a little advice--all those exotic flowers and trees in the jungles, especially that nasty rrrafflesia, will be jamming your chocobo's olfactory radar. You may have to search a wider radius than you're used to.
11995 : And that's why I'm going to present you with this rrrare, first-edition autographed chocograph for the Eastern and Western Altepa Deserts.
11996 : Before you go, let me give you a little advice--the sweltering heat and slippery sands of the deserts will take their toll on your bird. Be extra careful in choosing where you dig, because your bird will grow fatigued quickerrr than you're used to.
11997 : Yo ho ho and a bottle of mulsum! I may be a pirate, but ye won't sees me plunderin' the hearts of the wee lads and lassies!
11998 : Here, ya scurvy dawg, takes this booty and pass her on to an innocent child. Arrrg, but if I hears ya kept it fer yer own lonesome, I'll personally sees ya walk the plank!
11999 : Greetings. I am a journeyman trainer from the VCS, and I have been sent to this town to promote knowledge exchange between chocobo owners.
12000 : We believe that the best way to promote interaction between owners is through interaction between chocobos.
12001 : And after countless VCS conferences, we recently agreed on the establishment of a new program--
12002 : Kamp Kweh!
12003 : Breeders need only possess a chocobo to join. Please speak with me again if you are interested.
12004 : I can answer your questions regarding Kamp Kweh?
12005 : What would you like to know? What exactly is Kamp Kweh? How do I sign up? Are there any restrictions? Nothing at all.
12006 : Kamp Kweh is a place where fellow breeders can bring their chocobos to interact with each other.
12007 : At the camp, owners can check the status of their companions' animals...
12008 : ...as well as confirm breeding compatibility.
12009 : However, please note that any results from these tests are merely estimates, and may not fully reflect the actual condition of an animal.
12010 : Our wish is that through the various camp activities we offer, your chocobo will have the opportunity to improve its skills.
12011 : Only adventurers who are currently raising a chocobo can participate.
12012 : Owners can enroll their animals once they have hatched.
12013 : To begin, adventurers should first form a party of those who wish to participate, and then come talk to me or any of the other VCS journeyman trainers stationed throughout Vana'diel.
12014 : Please note that only up to six chocobos can attend the camp at one time, so do not come as an alliance.
12015 : We refuse admission to the following:
12016 : 1. Any owners who have not checked up on their chocobos recently. Those who feel that they may have been neglecting their animal may want to visit the stables before attempting to participate.
12017 : 2. Chocobos who are sleeping or have run away.
12018 : 3. Chocobos who have yet to be named.
12019 : 4. Party members who are too far away from the stables.
12020 : We would not think of leading a chocobo away from its pen when the owner was not present.
12021 : Welcome back. Have you come to enroll in Kamp Kweh?
12022 : Enroll? Yes. No.
12023 : I see. If you wish to participate in the future, feel free to contact me or one of my companions.
12024 : I am sorry, [sir/ma'am], your chocobo is currently unable to participate. Please confirm your chocobo's condition and speak with me again when everything is in order.
12025 : None of the other members of your party possess chocobos able to participate in camp activities. Please confirm their conditions and speak with me again when everything is in order.
12026 : None of your party members are close enough to the stables to participate in camp activities. Please speak with me again when everyone has assembled.
12027 : Now that we have arrived, we can begin.
12028 : What do you wish to do? Call your chocobo. Let it play with others. Check the chocobos' vitals. Check mating compatibility. Nothing.
12029 : Cheep!
12030 : Kwee!
12031 : Kweh!
12032 : seems relaxed.
12033 : seems excited.
12034 : seems pleased.
12035 : seems distressed.
12036 : seems happy.
12037 : looks like it wants to play with you as well.
12038 : Which chocobo? . . . . . Quit.
12039 : Something unexpected has arisen... I'm sorry, but I cannot allow your chocobos to play together.
12040 : The two seem to be getting along just fine.
12041 : The elder of the two seems to be treating the other as a younger [brother/sister].
12042 : Your chocobo's strength has slightly improved.
12043 : Your chocobo has become slightly more patient.
12044 : Your chocobo has become slightly more intelligent.
12045 : Your chocobo has become slightly more receptive.

12167 : Welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service desk is here to accommodate our beginning and intermediate racers.
12168 : I am sorry, but there are no races scheduled at the moment.
12169 : Participation in our organization's races requires that you either possess % or currently have your own full-grown chocobo.
12170 : How about you, [sir/ma'am]?
12171 : If possible, we would like you to join us, and help show those trainers in [Bastok and Windurst/San d'Oria and Windurst/San d'Oria and Bastok] which racing team is truly the best in Vana'diel.
12172 : What do you say? Tell me more. Sign me up! Not today.
12173 : Congratulations, %! You are now an official member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
12174 : I see. Please come back if you ever change your mind!
12175 : What would you like to know? Why race chocobos, anyway? How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kind of races are there? What are racing teams? Quit. Return.
12176 : Why not!? Our original plan was to establish locations across Vana'diel where people could test their birds' skills.
12177 : We felt that this would help us maintain breeder motivation, which in turn would ensure healthier, happier chocobos. A win-win situation, as we like to call it in the business.
12178 : However, as rumors of these new facilities began to leak out into the world, people began speculating about the possibility of officially sanctioned chocobo races...
12179 : The VCS could not ignore the voice of the masses, and it was not long before a meeting was held, a vote was taken, and the CRA was formed.
12180 : And that's why I'm here, trying to enlist you and other top breeders into our noble ranks.
12181 : Oh, and for our more seasoned veterans who feel there are no challenges left for them here at the track, the CRA has finished preparing a new race. And rumor has that it's a doozie!
12182 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
12183 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
12184 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
12185 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
12186 : Once you have registered your chocobo and entered it in a competition, the CRA will proceed in assigning it a licensed jockey.
12187 : Before each race you will be given the opportunity to give the jockey specific orders on his or her riding style.
12188 : In addition to these orders, you can also provide the jockey with items to use while riding, as well as equipment to improve your chocobo's performance.
12189 : Before a race, you can also check the strengths and weaknesses of the other participating chocobos. It is recommended that you use this data when deciding on what orders to give, or which items to equip.
12190 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
12191 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
12192 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
12193 : There are two main types of races.
12194 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
12195 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
12196 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
12197 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
12198 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match.
12199 : You must pay a fee in gil to participate in free runs, but you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance. You can join as many free runs as you wish in a single day (Earth time), but extra fees may be required for each additional race. (Stable hands have to make a living, too!)
12200 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
12201 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
12202 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
12203 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
12204 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
12205 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
12206 : Ah, it says here that you are a member of the [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team.
12207 : Have you come today to change your affiliation?
12208 : Remember, you will not be able to use any chocobucks earned in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] here, and you will also lose any Solo Victory Points that you may have. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
12209 : Join this team? Yes. No.
12210 : Congratulations! You are the newest member of the CRA's [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] racing team!
12211 : Understood. But remember, we are always looking for great racers like you to join our team. If you ever change your mind, I'll be right here waiting.
12212 : Ah, so you have brought items for your chocobo.
12213 : What do we have here...

12232 : ----------------------------------------
12233 : Free Run Chocobos: 8 Objective: None
12234 : While free runs usually have no specific objectives, the higher your chocobo places, the better the prize you will receive. We suggest you use these races to improve your skills before embarking on the more difficult official races.
12235 : Here is the information on the next race:
12236 : Novice Race I Chocobos: 4 Objective: Place 3rd or higher

12240 : Novice Race III Chocobos: 8 Objective: Place 3rd or higher
12241 : This race is quite similar to a free run in that there will be seven other chocobos racing against you. If you have one available, try equipping an item to improve your bird's performance.

12384 : A standard model, the elm saddle will stabilize your chocobo's stride. It also increases your mount's endurance.
12385 : A bit on the hefty side, the brass saddle can be somewhat taxing on a chocobo's endurance. It compensates for this, however, by increasing the bird's strength.

12466 : What would you like to know about? The promenade. Chocobet centers. The grandstand. Portals. Guides. Nothing for now.
12467 : Shops, as well as attendants to assist you in siging up your chocobo for a race, are located on the promenade.
12468 : It can be found just south of here.
12469 : The promenade itself is split into eastern and western halves, both of which house all of the same facilities. Be sure to stop by and have a look when you get a chance.
12470 : Attendants at the chocobet centers are there to assist you with acquiring %, as well as collecting your winnings.
12471 : There are a total of five centers readily available for your convenience, each of which are located near the transportation portals. There are two to the east and west of here, and one just to the north.
12472 : All chocobet centers are capable of providing the same services.
12473 : The grandstand faces the racetrack itself, and allows spectators to sit and enjoy the races in comfort.
12474 : To get there, just follow the red carpet all the way through the betting area. You can't miss it.
12475 : The standard admission fee is # gil. Patrons who possess % may enter free of charge.
12476 : % will be provided anytime you purchase % or sign up for a race.
12477 : Your % will become invalid as soon as you leave the grandstand. Reentry will require you to pay an additional admission fee.
12478 : This racetrack is equipped with portals to transport our patrons to any of the three nations, as well as Jeuno and Al Zahbi.
12479 : As you can see, we are regularly visited by a multitude of race fans, breeders, and jockeys from every realm imaginable. We have therefore relegated each portal to a single destination in an attempt to avoid congestion.
12480 : For the same reasons, we ask that visitors refrain from setting up bazaars while here. Violators of this rule will be severely punished. Your cooperation is appreciated.
12481 : Guides can be found throughout the premises waiting to assist you.
12482 : They can help by transporting you to the location of your choice.
12483 : This service is provided free of charge, so please don't hesitate to make use of it.
12484 : What would you like to know about? Racing teams. Race rules. Race types. Victory points. Race Progression. That's about it.
12485 : A race chocobo's owner or jockey may join one of the three racing teams by registering at the appropriate VCS branch.
12486 : Each nation's Team Victory Points are the sum total of all of its members' Solo Victory Points. The Team Victory Point totals are then used to determine the overall weekly standings.
12487 : In order to race your chocobo here, we ask that you please affiliate yourself first with one of the three teams.
12488 : For details, please check with your local CRA racing center.
12489 : The races held here are almost identical to the official and private races held at the other racetracks.
12490 : What distinguishes our races is the fact that victories here qualify you to collect larger cash purses, as well as Victory Points.
12491 : Eligibility to participate in the higher-level races will require a certain number of Solo Victory Points.
12492 : Depending on a team's weekly standings, its members may suffer certain eligibility restrictions. At the same time, they may also be privy to certain benefits.
12493 : The teams in second and third place will have the advantage of being allowed more entry positions in any given race, while those of the leading team are restricted.
12494 : The leading team will, however, be granted the privilege of selecting higher-quality saddles for their race chocobos.
12495 : The CRA reserves the right to impose a handicap system when it is determined that the gap in skill between chocobos is simply too great to make for a fair race.
12496 : In such an event, the less endowed of the chocobos will be granted certain enhancing effects, such as Haste or Refresh.
12497 : Whether handicaps will be enforced or not will be determined after signups are complete. Make sure to keep an eye on your chocobo's settings.
12498 : Each race title will include a code, such as C4. This code is the race grade.
12499 : For example, a C4 Chocobo Race would indicate a typical grade 4 race.
12500 : We have four race grades, ranging from C4 to C1. The lower the number, the higher the grade. This, of course, means larger entry fees, but also more prize money.
12501 : No matter which race you enter, upon completion you will be prevented from joining any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time). Higher-grade races carry larger purses, so most racers like to use their opportunities to go after those.
12502 : Solo Victory Points will be awarded to you every race, depending on how well you finish.
12503 : As your Solo Victory Points accumulate, your chocobo will be able to gain entry to high-grade races.
12504 : Should a racer return to the circuit after an absence of four weeks or more, the CRA will be forced to deduct a number of Solo Victory Points.
12505 : Only on the rarest of occasions will such penalties be imposed. However, there are some races in which you will be unable to participate if you do not have a certain amount of Solo Victory Points in your possession.
12506 : Also, obtaining Solo Victory Points will also grant your nation Team Victory Points.
12507 : The three teams are in constant competition with one another, and a weekly ranking system is in place based on Team Victory Point totals.
12508 : As a team climbs up in rank, certain benefits will follow. You may see new items available for purchase with chocobucks, preferential treatment at the races, and so on.
12509 : Keep in mind that should you change your team affiliation, you will be forced to forfeit any accumulated Solo Victory Points.
12510 : We have a total of four races that run in succession.
12511 : Each race has its own dedicated signup window. Here there will be four attendants ready to serve all your racing needs.
12512 : Even if the race registration at one window closes, registration for the next race will begin immediately at the neighboring window.
12513 : Races will be held one after the other, so you'll have plenty of chances to watch and bet. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!
12514 : What would you like to hear more about? Race preparations. Signup procedure. Collecting winnings. Signing up for another race. I'm fine, thanks.
12515 : There are a few facts that you should know before running in a race.
12516 : First of all, you absolutely must be affiliated with one of the three official racing teams. These, as you may already know, are San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst.
12517 : Secondly, it is required that your bird be registered as a race chocobo, for obvious reasons. No race chocobo, no race.
12518 : Thirdly, you will be responsible for providing your own items to be used during the race. The CRA leaves this to the racer's discretion...
12519 : All of these services can be provided at any racing center, but to facilitate the registration process it is recommended that you conduct all such affairs at the appropriate branch.
12520 : A racing fee is necessary to gain entry into a chocobo race. The racing center will inform you of the cost, so please be sure to pay when signing up for a race.
12521 : Also, when signing up to race, you will be able to choose a saddle, as well as the lane in which your chocobo will race.
12522 : There are multifarious saddles at the rider's disposal, each of which will affect your chocobo's conditioning. In addition, the types of saddles available will change depending on your team's current ranking.
12523 : There are a total of eight lanes, but general conditions for all of them are the same. Feel free to race in the lane of your choice.
12524 : Setting these options will complete the signup process. You will then be given %, which you will need to exchange later to collect any winnings.
12525 : In the event that you should lose or misplace your %, you will be unable to collect any prize money, chocobucks, or Victory Points that you may be entitled to. I cannot stress enough how important it is to hold on to it.
12526 : The races can be viewed from our grandstand area. Take a seat and cheer on your bird!
12527 : You will be eligible for prize money if your chocobo places either first, second, or third.
12528 : To collect, simply hand in the % you received during race signup at any signup center.
12529 : The amount of gil, chocobucks, and Victory Points you qualify to receive will be based upon your bird's placement.
12530 : You will lose the right to collect your winnings from a race exactly one week after that race has ended.
12531 : After participating in a race, your chocobo will be unable to join any other races for a period of 20 hours (Earth time).
12532 : This pertains only to races held here, and will not affect your eligibility for races held at any other racetracks.
12533 : We have implemented these restrictions here as to allow the greatest number of participants' entry into our races. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.
12534 : What would you like to ask? What is chocobetting? How do I bet? What are odds? When do I bet? How do I collect winnings? Nothing.
12535 : Chocobetting is a form of entertainment where bettors attempt to pick the two birds that will finish first and second in a race.
12536 : To make it a bit more interesting, the bettor can then wager on their picks in increments of 100 gil.
12537 : Should lady luck smile upon you and your picks hit, you can win prize money, the amount of which is determined by the odds for that race.
12538 : For example, let's say that you were to bet ten quills (1000 gil) on Entries No. 5 and No. 7.
12539 : And let's say that the toteboard showed the odds for the race at 110 gil. If your picks were to finish as the top two birds, you would be eligible to collect 1100 gil in winnings, for a total profit of 100 gil.
12540 : Of course, it goes without saying that should your picks not have the fortune of finishing in the top two places, you will receive absolutely no gil.
12541 : The gambler's fallacy is our mantra here at the racetrack! Remember, you are special! Let it ride!
12542 : To place a chocobet, you must obtain % from the chocobet center.
12543 : For any single %, a bettor may purchase up to 999 quills. Each quill costs 100 gil.
12544 : We highly recommend that you obtain information on the chocobos you will be betting on before purchasing your ticket. It is always good to know where your money is going.
12545 : Odds determine how much gil you will receive in winnings per quill on your chocobet ticket.
12546 : Winnings are calculated by taking the total monetary sum of all bets for any given pairing. For example, should ten bettors each place the same 100-quill (10,000 gil) chocobet, the total used to determine the winnings would be 100,000 gil.
12547 : It goes without saying that not all bettors will be winners. The money from losing bets is used to pay off the winners.
12548 : What this means is that if you place a bet on an unseemly chocobo pairing, or pick two birds without much money riding on them, and are fortunate enough to win, you can make quite a tidy sum.
12549 : Toteboards display the odds at both the chocobet center as well as the grandstand. Toteboards have eight columns with the number on top of each column representing one chocobo, and the number to the left of each column representing another. If your bet is for chocobos No. 2 and No. 5, check the #2 column to see how much a 2-5 bet will pay per quill.
12550 : The odds are constantly changing right up until the race begins. If the number of bets on a popular chocobo pairing keeps increasing, then consequently the odds will go down.
12551 : Even if you place a large bet early on, the odds may still change as time passes. So take your time and consider carefully.
12552 : Chocobets can be placed as soon as the signup period for a race has ended. The betting window will close several minutes before the race begins.
12553 : Make sure to get your bet in on time. Even if you are in the middle of placing a bet, it will be cancelled if you exceed the allowed time window by even a single second.
12554 : Once the race is finished, you can exchange your % at any chocobet center to collect your winnings.
12555 : Without % you will be unable to collect your winnings, so make sure not to lose it.
12556 : % is valid for up to one week (Earth time) after completion of the race for which it was purchased.
12557 : Should one week pass, we will be unable to accept the ticket, so it is always best to cash out as soon as possible.

12612 : Greetings, and welcome to the Chocobo Racing Association's (CRA) [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] branch. This service area is here to accommodate our more experienced and accomplished racers.
12613 : I am truly sorry [sir/ma'am], but we are unable to service your request here. This service area only caters to [San d'Orian/Bastokan/Windurstian] CRA Classic winners.
12614 : Registration for such an event can be carried out at the service areas for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
12615 : The organizing attendants in each location are as follows: [Southern San d'Oria: Alangriche/Bastok Mines: Jazgeh/Windurst Waters: Turumi-Byrumi] [Northern San d'Oria: Monteverle/Bastok Markets: Galienne/Windurst Port: Lhimo Keanyohn] [Port San d'Oria: Ramiene/Port Bastok: Salvador/Windurst Woods: Rungaga].
12616 : For beginning and intermediate races, you'll want to speak with [Alangriche/Jazgeh/Rungaga].
12617 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
12618 : My apologies, [sir/ma'am], but it appears that you have yet to conduct all of the necessary processing at the service area for advanced and veteran racers. Please speak to the attendants there for further assistance.
12619 : Which would you like to hear about? CRA rationale behind veteran races. How do I register for a race? How do I prepare for a race? What are chocobucks? What kinds of races are there? What are racing teams? What about race opponents? Quit. Return.
12620 : With the establishment of the Chocobo Circuit and the introduction of chocobo races, the hidden talents of a number of chocobos across Vana'diel finally had a venue in which to come to fruition.
12621 : As the next step, the CRA recognized these rare and valuable talents, and developed a new, special kind of race to showcase them even more than before!
12622 : The Monster Races!
12623 : Without the interference of jockeys, breeders can now pit their chocobos head-to-head against a number of monster species in brutal, raw, no-holds-barred racing!
12624 : Even some of the CRA's very own best and brightest chocobos will be entering into these races geared specifically to our veteran clientele. What more thrilling way to spend a day at the races than to see Vana'diel's most elite chocobos competing against its most fiendish monsters!?
12625 : First of all, your chocobo must be fully grown. It doesn't matter if you are still tending to it, or if it has been sent to pasture, as long as it is large enough to ride.
12626 : Next, you must bring me either % or %. This is all I will require. There are no hidden fees.
12627 : As your chocobo develops, be sure to re-register it. This will ensure that your steed is provided with the equipment that most suits its current condition.
12628 : Finally, you may only register one chocobo at a time, but are free to register a new bird whenever you wish. You need only speak with me to make any necessary changes.
12629 : Since these races are geared towards our more veteran racers and will not make use of jockeys, all in-race conduct is based solely on the chocobos themselves. The CRA wants these races to be as pure as possible!
12630 : The same philosophy applies to the usage of items as well. Simply preset the items you wish for your chocobo to have at its disposal. It will use them as it sees fit based on real-time assessment of racing conditions.
12631 : Many breeders are distressed by these rules, but we assure you there is no need for concern. If your chocobo has progressed far enough in the Chocobo Circuit to even be participating in the Monster Races, it is a given that it has enough know-how to use its items wisely. Have faith in your bird.
12632 : Also, as with other races in the past, you will be able to check on the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents at this service area. Many breeders like to use this information for developing their race strategies, and we encourage you to do the same.
12633 : Depending on your chocobo's performance in select CRA-sanctioned races, you may or may not receive a prize consisting of VCS-mint chocobucks.
12634 : Chocobucks can be used to purchase items, as well as upgrade your mount. Chocobucks are also required to participate in official races.
12635 : Currently, players can earn up to, but no more than, 1000 chocobucks. However, this may change without notice.
12636 : There are two main types of races.
12637 : The first type is called an official race. To participate in one of these, you will require chocobucks.
12638 : Placing in an official race will earn you gil. The more races you complete, the more respected you will become in the breeder community.
12639 : You may also take part in an official race as often as needed to complete the specified objectives.
12640 : However, after some of the more grueling races, you may be required to wait before entering the next. This is to give your chocobo, as well as the others, an opportunity to rest before running again.
12641 : The second type of race is called a free run. Unlike the official races, these can be run at any time, regardless of the results of a previous match. In addition, you will have the opportunity to earn chocobucks depending on your chocobo's performance.
12642 : You are not able to sign up for free runs at this location. To do so, please visit the appropriate service area for beginning and intermediate racers. Thank you for your understanding.
12643 : The CRA is split up into three racing teams representing Bastok, Windurst, and San d'Oria.
12644 : Each team has its own skilled jockeys, and offers unique services that cannot be obtained at the other two.
12645 : Breeders are allowed to register with any team they like, and may change their affiliation at any time.
12646 : In the event that you wish to leave a racing team, all official race results, as well as earned chocobucks, will be saved.
12647 : You never have to worry that your past accomplishments may be deleted and lost forever. You only need rejoin the team to restore all your old data.
12648 : Anyway, there is no harm in visiting all three racing teams to find which one suits you best (though I know you'll choose this one).
12649 : Your opponents in the official monster races will be any of a host of beasts reared and trained by racing aficionado and announcer extraordinaire, Markovich.
12650 : We ensure all participating breeders that these monsters are in no way enhanced or engineered for racing excellence. The CRA has been adamant about maintaining race participants to as close to their natural state of being as possible.
12651 : Though each variety of monster does in fact possess characteristic abilities and traits. And they have undergone extensive training to optimize their use of these in races.
12652 : As with the chocobos, however, the monsters will be absent jockeys of any kind. It is possible, and expected, that they will often unleash their wild, animalistic instincts on the racetrack. Consider yourself warned.
12653 : In the spirit of drawing crowds, the CRA has also elected to place some of their finest birds on the racing roster as well. Breeders can also expect to see other superior-class chocobos taking part. It's going to take a lot more than just speed and endurance to win these races!
12654 : Finally, in the absence of jockeys, finish-line sensors will be employed. These devices will be attached to the contestants' ankles, or in the absence of ankles, some other such appropriate place.
12655 : Dueler's Race Participants: 2 Objective: Place 1st
12656 : And now, Markovich's undeniably unorthodox, and arguably downright unethical, monster race is about to begin!
12657 : Survival Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
12658 : Following such a fine showing in the Dueler's Race, the next contest is about to start! Who will be the last beast standing?
12659 : Deadly Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
12660 : Warning! The next race contains monsters of unprecedented nastiness. Enter at your own risk! The name says it all!
12661 : Mystery Race Participants: 4 chocobos & 4 ??? Objective: Place 1st
12662 : What's this? We've been asked to pass along yet another challenge, this time from an anonymous source! I'm not altogether clear on what is about to transpire...
12663 : Lethal Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
12664 : The games are over, ladies and gentlemen. Markovich is laying it all on the table. Here come his most ferocious beasts to date!
12665 : Dream Race Participants: 8 Objective: Place 1st
12666 : This is the moment you've all been waiting for. The CRA has brought its racing elite out from the stables! The treacherous offroad track is fraught with perils! And an absolutely awe-inspiring trophy is ready for the winner! Bragging rights for life are on the line!

12715 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's time for another action-packed chocobo race! I'll be your commentator, Goccilo.
12716 : Our special guests today are everybody's favorite disgruntled chick, Sakura...
12717 : ...and her faithful servant/translator, Markovich.
12718 : Good day, fol--
12720 : Sakura says that she loves you all from the bottom of her tiny heart.
12721 : Alrighty then, our next race features # of Vana'diel's top chocobos. Let us start off by introducing the birds and their jockeys.
12722 : First we have , who will be ridden by [the ace of the chase, Ignazio/three-time chocobo racing allstar, Eudocia/the bloody emperor, Roinolier/the empress of speed, Maurette/Lami-Baami Suave Esquire III/the red rose of racing, Sosopapa/CRA legend, Khowa Mathgalhi/rising CRA star, Bayansh].
12724 : She says, When the ace makes chase, there's not a bird in Vana'diel who can keep pace.
12725 : She says, And you can bet the chocobo farm that this year it'll be 'four-time' allstar!
12726 : She says, This jockey doesn't get his name because he yields to through traffic, if you know what I mean.
12727 : She says, There isn't a jockey in Vana'diel who loves her steed more than the empress of speed.
12728 : She says, This heart-throb treats his mounts like he treats his women--with an unparalleled sense of grace, a sixth sense, you could say.
12729 : She says, Sosopapa has got the moves to make even the stiffest of necks turn.
12730 : She says, This former racing champion has decided to temporarily come out of retirement (again) for what will be her final race.
12731 : She says, This natural wasn't a born natural, but was born with natural ability that naturally transformed him into what we often call a 'natural.'
12732 : Next we have [Pure Beauty/Ambitious Impact/Young Typhoon], being ridden by [the chocogirl next door, Hazina/dark chocostalker, Pikanza/self-proclaimed chocogeek, Qunbubu].
12733 : Sakura says, Don't be fooled by the innocent smile--this girl will rip your chocobo's gizzard out and eat it for a late breakfast or early lunch!
12734 : Sakura says, This Galka's unrelenting love for all things chocobo makes him a dangerous opponent on the track.
12735 : Sakura says, Thousands of hours of chocoresearch have sharpened the mind of this jolly jockey into a pointy stick, ready to poke and prod anyone who dares stand in her way.
12736 : Our next chocobo is [Shining Lady/Moon Night/Jet Fire], ridden by [Chanaille, a.k.a. Dances With Chocobos/the chocowhisperer, Sah Zhaowam/Sakura's number one fan, Chamu-Pashamu].
12737 : Sakura says, Ain't no one knows a chocobo's heart like this here lil' lady.
12738 : Sakura says, She has a good grasp of our vocabulary, but her pronunciation, especially her gutturals and fricatives, need a little work.
12740 : Sakura says she knows who she'll be rooting for this race...
12741 : The next contestant is [Invincible Ace/Gold Queen/Million Spirit], jockeyed by [chocobo reincarnate, Vieuballideme/hyper breeder, Graciela/20-year racing veteran, Mayza-Hapurza].
12742 : She says that simply smelling like a chocobo doesn't make one a chocobo.
12743 : She says that breeding chocobos is like stocking a warehouse with 10,000 opo-opos and 10,000 typewriters--you are bound to stumble across a masterpiece sooner or later.
12744 : She says that this Tarutaru has been practicing the choquestrian arts since he was only two years old.
12745 : And that's our lineup. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a feeling that today's match up will go down in the annals of racing history.
12746 : And here's today's lineup. What excitement lies in store for all our faithful chocofans listening on the CRA linkshell channel?
12747 : The contestants have arrived at the starting line, and the race will begin shortly.
12748 : Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to another round of awe-inspiring head-to-head chocobo racing! I am Goccilo, your master of ceremonies.
12749 : And joining us today are the commentating duo which require no introduction, the equally adroit and adorable Sakura...
12750 : ...and her obedient interpreter, everyone's favorite lover of animals, Markovich!
12751 : Good day, fol--
12753 : Sakura would like to take this opportunity to speak out against fowl abuse across Vana'diel.
12754 : And on that note, here come our eight avian racers now!
12755 : ##:  ##:  ##:  ##:
12756 : And there's your lineup, folks! It looks like we're going to have a real doozy on our hands here today!
12757 : Well, let's get right down to it! The race is about to begin!
12758 : I must admit, I was a tad vexed about who our bird might be facing today, but I realize now that my petty presentiments were quite unfounded.
12759 : Yeah! What he said! You're lucky we're even letting you share the same track as Best!
12760 : Yeah... Good luck, %...
12761 : Today's match is a head-to-head battle, with the winner taking all! Let's start off by introducing our two competitors.
12762 : And then we have the humbly named Best, being jockeyed by Aht Urhgan mercenary, [Bashraf/Foudeel/Wahboud].
12763 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Bashraf doesn't give any orders to his chocobo at all. He only shows up because chapter 17, article LXIV of the CRA rulebook requires 'all mounts to be mounted.'
12764 : Sakura says, It's rumored that Foudeel often spends weeks planning out strategies for each of his two-minute races.
12765 : Sakura says to watch out. What Wahboud lacks in brains, talent, deftness, finesse, etcetera, he makes up for with his extra-large supply of spore bombs and pepper biscuits.
12766 : They say pictures are worth a thousand words, but your visage screams only one--fear.
12767 : Yeah! What he said! We lost last time, but we won't this time! Tell [him/her], Wahboud!
12768 : Fortune smiled on you before, but don't think you'll be so lucky this time!
12769 : As residing VCS president, I would be disgracing my position if I did not put my best into this race.
12770 : %. It is time you proved your worth as a chocobo breeder.
12771 : Good luck, %. I don't mean to braggy-wag, but with me in the race, you'll need it more than ever. Mwahahahahah!
12772 : Today's race is a head-to-head-to-head match-up between an adventurer, a mercenary, and a high-ranking VCS official. Now let's take a closer look at the participants!
12773 : And next we have [Air/Blood/Spring], ridden by [VCS president, Hantileon/advanced chocobo trainer, Zopago/advanced chocobo trainer, Pulonono].
12775 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer that preaches 'tough love' needs to be gently nudged off the sacrificial altar in Ifrit's Cauldron.
12776 : Sakura says, Any chocobo trainer with a tail has my complete endorsement.
12777 : Sakura says, Big things often come in small packages.
12778 : Ladies and gentlemen! The 26th sovereign of the mighty Kingdom of San d'Oria, Destin R d'Oraguille, has called for a grand tournament--
12779 : a 300-year tradition extending back to the days of the Warking, Acheufagais R d'Oraguille--The d'Oraguille Victory Malm!
12780 : This is Goccilo, and I will be bringing you the breathtaking play-by-play.
12781 : Joining us today is none other than His excellent Excellency, San d'Oria's one and only prince regent, Pieuje I d'Oraguille!
12782 : It says here that your very own chocobo, Noble Rose, will be running the malm. What do you feel are her chances of taking home the coveted piece de resistance?
12783 : We have spent many hours training this fine steed in the arts of war. We do not believe there exists another bird in the Kingdom, nay, the world, who might best our Noble Rose.
12784 : Well, there you have it.
12785 : Now let's take a look at today's participants...
12786 : Ladies and gentlemen! President of the Bastokan Republic, Hrichter Karst, proudly presents...
12787 : ...the most prestigious chocobo race in all of southern Quon--the Gustaberg Derby!
12788 : Joining me today is Metalworks mastermind, Cid.
12789 : Mr. Cid... May I call you Mr. Cid? Just Cid? Alright. Cid, what can you tell us about your entry in the derby, Infinity XIII?
12790 : Absolutely nothing! Do you think I would divulge the secret training methods my team developed to make Infinity the fastest bird this side of Vana'diel!?
12791 : Ladies and gentlemen! Minister Apururu and over a hundred 'hands' from Windurst's Manustery have converged here today to bring you a race originally established by chocobo-loving Star Sibyl, Rakapopo--
12792 : The Rakapopo Cup!
12793 : Today's guest is Heavens Tower's number-one secretariat extraordinaire--Kupipi!
12794 : So, I've learned that you have entered your very own personal chocobo in the cup. What do you think her chances are of taking home the grand prize?
12795 : Are you making fun of me, sir!? Well, you may be laughing now, but I will be the one busting my gutty-wutty when my Starlight sails across the finish line years before the nearest competitaru!
12796 : Ah yes, we have heard much of this master of the reins. We sense a great warrior under that unassuming guise.
12797 : My, this bird has quite a long list of accomplishments under its...uh...stirrups. He just might give my Invincible XIII a run for his money!
12798 : [Ace of the space/Three-time chocobo racing allstar/Bloody emperor/Empress of tweed/Whachamacallit Esquire III/Dead rose of racing/CRA legend/CRA rising star]? Never heard of [him/her/him/her/him/her/her/him]!
12799 : We seem to recall exchanging pleasantries with this fine maiden at one Kamp Kweh. We are quite impressed with her rapid progress.
12800 : Chocostalker? Perhaps this young man needs another hobby...
12801 : Chocogeek, chocofreak. It'll take more than an embiggened brainy-wainy to beat Starlight!
12802 : What a queer soubriquet... We shall see if this character truly can read the hearts of her chocobos.
12803 : Hmph... There are some things that cannot be expressed through mere words...
12804 : Hey! I'm Sakura's biggest fan! I won't let Starlight lose to some imposter!
12805 : Noble Rose expressed acute interest in this so-called reincarnate's redolent aura. Might he truly be... Absurd!
12806 : Alright, so she can breed. But can she race?
12807 : Hah! Well, I have been riding chocobos for twenty-one years!
12808 : And next is [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight], being ridden by [San d'Orian monarlais, Halver M Borel/Number 5 Mithril Musketeer, Naji/Aurastery minister, Koru-Moru/San d'Orian Conflict commander, Excenmille M Aurchiat/Number 4 Mythril Musketeer, Ayame/former Rhinostery minister, Yoran-Oran]!
12809 : Halver has claimed to detest all things chocobo. However, for some reason, there has yet to be a bird that has shunned the monarlais. Perhaps he reminds the whelps of their mothers.
12810 : Bet you didn't know Naji has his own bird. Hasn't won a race in three years, though...
12811 : Both Starlight and the professor hate to take orders... Maybe that's why they're such a perfect combination! Each thinks they're the one in control!
12812 : The commander is an exceptional leader. It is difficult to imagine there is a chocobo on Vana'diel that he could not humble.
12813 : When Ayame's not training, she's down at the stables taking care of Infinity. A great girl, she is.
12814 : When the professor's not stumbling over his speech impediment-ethy, he's researching the intricacies of chocobo behavioral patterns.
12815 : And they're off!
12816 : Markovich, what did you think of the start?
12817 : Well, I fel--
12819 : Sakura says it was a picture-perfect start and that I need to shut my mouth.
12820 : Ah! It looks like one of the birds was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
12821 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the birds has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
12822 : And as they pass the halfway mark...
12823 : ##  holds on to the lead!
12824 : # different chocobos continue their battle for the lead!
12825 : While from behind the pack, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
12826 : While from behind, ##  seems to be vying for the perfect time to make its move!
12827 : All # chocobos battle for the lead!
12828 : Neither of these two rivals are willing to yeild to the other! What an amazing race!
12829 : And would you look at that! Quite a battle is brewing in the tunnel!
12831 : Sakura says, The race ain't over until the fat chocobo sings.
12832 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
12833 : What's this!? ## 's jockey has pulled out %!
12834 : Incredible! 's speed is approaching dangerous limits!
12835 : It looks like  is storing its stamina for one final dash to the finish!
12836 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
12837 : 's speed has begun to drop off!
12838 : It looks like  has begun to tire!
12839 : The speed of the other chocobos has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
12840 : The opponent's speed has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
12841 : The nearby chocobos are beginning to look confused! I doubt if their jockeys will be able to use any more items!
12842 : The other chocobo is beginning to look confused! I doubt if its jockey will be able to use any more items!
12843 : The rain has stopped and the clouds have begun to part! Could this be a blessing for !?
12844 : Oh my! It has started to rain! Could this be a blessing for !?
12845 : And yet  seems completely unaffected by the attack!
12846 : And yet the chocobos seem completely unaffected by the attack!
12847 : And now they're approaching the final corner!
12848 : ##  still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
12849 : It's crowded up front with # chocobos still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
12850 : ##  is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
12851 : It's crowded up front with all # chocobos still fighting for the lead!
12852 : The two chocobos are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
12853 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching ##  today!
12854 : And  takes the crown!
12855 : What's this? ##  is making its move on the lead!
12856 : And it's  by a beak!!!
12857 : Let's take a look at the results...
12858 : #:  (##)
12859 : There you have it! If you had told me that's how it'd end up, I never would have believed you!
12860 : Now let's see what our resident expert has to say about the race.
12861 : Sakura says that great races like the one we just witnessed come along only once in a blue or green moon.
12862 : Sakura says that this was one of the best races she has seen in ages.
12863 : What an amazing race! The other chocobos were no match for [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight]. Can you give us a few words on your bird's stellar performance?
12864 : What an outcome! Who would have imagined that the mighty [Noble Rose/Infinity XIII/Starlight] could be toppled from its throne? Do you have any comments on your bird's performance?
12865 : [Halver/Excenmille] and Noble Rose both exceeded our expectations. Tonight, we shall hold a grand feast in honor of the victors!
12866 : The failures of today are the stairways to the victories of tomorrow. Once the jockey has received his lashings, he will begin preparations for the next race.
12867 : Performance of the bird? Without the hard work, sweat, and ingenuity of my race team, Infinity XIII would still be trying to find his way to the starting line! High-tech training! That's the wave of the future!
12868 : Oh well... I guess it's back to the drawing board...
12869 : Exactly as I expected, Gocci! Exactly as I expected!
12870 : The race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you! There was no way Starlight could lose! Her horoscope said so!
12871 : And there you have it. This is Goccilo, signing off! See you next time, chocofans!
12872 : And now, let's see the results from the last race.
12873 : #:  (##)
12874 : And that's all she wrote, folks!
12875 : The winnings for a #-# bet come to # gil per quill!
12876 : Phew! Another nail-biter in the record books! Sakura, any thoughts on that exceptional race?
12877 : She says that with so many spirited competitors, it's a shame that they can't all be winners!
12878 : She says that such exhilarating races always get her competitive juices flowing.
12879 : Until next time, race fans...
12880 : Now, let us move on to the awards ceremony.
12881 : Taking the crown for today's race was none other than !
12882 : To the winning steed's owner we present the %, %, and the exalted title of Rocochookie, I mean, Chocorookie!
12883 : And to the ambitious and sporting %, we present this undeniably useful %!
12884 : Good show, %. However, we must confess, we did not fathom we would be here handing away the laurels intended for Noble Rose.
12885 : Excellent race, %! You'll have to tell me later what kind of training you've been doing.
12886 : Okay, maybe your chocobo is pretty fast... But I still think the race was rigged! Rigged, I tell you!
12887 : Sakura says that she's seen better-conditioned chocobos at the local morgue.
12888 : But she also wants to congratulate it on its performance.

12902 : With me today is a man who needs absolutely no introduction, Markovich, and our favorite...
12903 : Oh...? Isn't the adorable Sakura with us today?
12904 : I'm afraid Sakura's been rather busy lately and won't be able to join us here at these races. I'll do my best to make up for her absence.
12905 : Is that so...? Things just won't be the same without her lovably abrasive, tongue-in-cheek comments...
12906 : Hmph! Enough of that crying into your microphone. You of all people should know that the show must go on!
12907 : Besides, today we have a very special race in store for our viewers. My very own baby will be taking the field!
12908 : Why, I was so looking forward to today's race, I couldn't catch a single wink of sleep last night!
12909 : But of course! I had forgotten all about it! Ladies and gentlemen, have we got a special treat for you! Today's race will see a chocobo and a monster go head-to-head!
12910 : But that's not where it ends! There will be not a single jockey to adulterate this epic battle of bird versus beast! How do you like the sound of that, folks?
12911 : A bold experiment in racing, if I do say so myself. Markovich, how do you foresee the competitors reacting to each other's presence in this most unusual of settings?
12912 : It is my understanding that an especially intelligent chocobo was chosen to partake in this race, so there shouldn't be any worry about it being spooked.
12913 : Moreover, my little fluffykins is as well-bred and well-behaved as your average head of state! But...
12914 : But...?
12915 : I can't say anything for certain heading into this race. After all, nothing like this has ever been attempted in the history of chocobo racing.
12916 : I see... Could that perhaps be the reason why this first-ever experiment has been limited to a one-on-one affair?
12917 : You're certainly on the ball today, Goccilo. Even if the chances are slim, we wouldn't want anything to go awry now, would we?
12918 : But enough talking, I say. It's time to give the viewers what they've come here to see!
12919 : Oh, yes, right... Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the delay! It is my pleasure to introduce the two plucky participants in this history-making race!
12920 : In the chocobo corner, we have , undisputed champion of the official races, and considered by many to be one of the greatest birds ever to grace the Chocobo Circuit.
12921 : Oooh... So this is the much hyped-about chocobo? I wonder if it'll be able to stand up to my Pacey.
12922 : 's formidable opponent will be Phantom Pacer! Don't let the lamblike good looks fool you, folks. This one truly lives up to the expression, a wolf in sheep's clothing!
12923 : I'll have you know that Pacey's appearance isn't just for show. I've survived many a cold winter snuggling up to her fluffy coat. Much better for my aching joints than a crackling fire, I tell you!
12924 : I'm absolutely breathless! That was as hotly contested a race as we have seen in recent years! Any thoughts, Markovich?
12925 : Hrm. This race has proven beyond doubt that monsters like my Pacey can race alongside chocobos without any problems whatsoever.
12926 : Indeed! I for one am certainly looking forward to seeing more such races!
12927 : With me today is our regular avian advocate turned adversary, Markovich!
12928 : Whoopee! Bring them on, I say!
12929 : Erm...yes... Now, let's take a look at the courageous contenders in today's race.
12930 : Oooh, so this is the chocobo that's been making headlines. I wonder if it'll be a match for my babies.
12931 : Next, we have the perennial woodenspooner, Keyaki! Despite its dismal track record, its never-say-die attitude has earned the admiration of fans and competitors alike.
12932 : Truly a bird on a mission, Goccilo. I just hope I'll live long enough to see its efforts pay off.
12933 : And with four monsters completing the lineup, I think we can brace ourselves for another encounter of epic proportion!
12934 : My, oh my...! I never imagined commentating would be so enjoyable without Sakura around to--
12935 : A-ahem! I...I mean, um, yes, I believe the race lived up to all expectations. No racing enthusiast could possibly go home disappointed after such an inspirational display.
12936 : All competitors raced gallantly and are deserving of praise, but none more so than the victor...who just happens to be one of my babies! Well done, my pretty! Well done!
12937 : It's unfortunate, though, that race conditions hindered the performance of some of the more promising contenders... <Sniffle>
12938 : Next in the lineup is Sakura. ...!? What on Vana'diel!?
12939 : Hrmmm... Well, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
12940 : Uh, of course, that couldn't have been our Sakura. Though I must admit, for a moment there...I mean, who wouldn't have been shocked to see...
12941 : What are you blabbering on about now? Pull yourself together, man! There are countless race fans waiting to be entertained by our witty commentary!
12942 : Um, yes... Please forgive me...
12943 : And won't you look at the lineup! This time we have a tiger...and even a raptor! Can you believe it, folks? I'm sure glad to be up here and not down on the track alongside the likes of them! Is there no creature they won't bring in!?
12944 : And with me today is our regular guest commentator...
12945 : Huh? Why isn't Markovich here?
12946 : Ohohohohohoho! You seem in a bind, Mister Goccilo.
12947 : <Gulp> You...you're that mage from Windurst...
12948 : ...Professor Shantotto!
12949 : If you're in need of a replacement for Markovich, as a racing connoisseur, I'd be glad to make the switch.
12950 : Furthermore, in a stroke of sheer coincidence, four custom-built Cardians are here in my presence.
12951 : So if you care to hear out my little proposal, these race-ready Cardians are also at your disposal.
12952 : With Markovich and his racing monsters absent, looks like I have no other choice... Will you really help us, Professor Shantotto?
12953 : With which black-hearted biddy do you have me confused? Enough with your doubting, there are competitors waiting to be introduced.
12954 : First up, we have Jack of Trophies, who has been climbing the Cardian ranks at breakneck speed since its upgrade.
12955 : Jack of Trophies' transfiguration was a sight to behold. I just can't wait to see how its story will unfold.
12956 : Next, I introduce to you, Queen of Trophies, who has been the mainstay of Windurst's Cardian force since its inception.
12957 : Queen of Trophies knows not the meaning of the word failure. Once set on a mission, from that course it will not veer.
12958 : Then we have King of Trophies, whose state-of-the-art leg component is a testament to Windurst's achievements in magical engineering. This experimental Cardian could very well be the future of Cardian technology, folks.
12959 : Even I dare not claim to know of what King of Trophies is capable. If some mishap should occur, be so kind as to not hold me culpable.
12960 : Next we have Ace of Trophies, whose racing prowess is vouched to be in a class of its own. Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen--this Cardian is a championship contender!
12961 : For Ace of Trophies, championship contender is an unfitting description. Even consecutive champion would not be too high an expectation.
12962 : Um...Professor Shantotto... Shouldn't we be introducing other race participants as well...and not only your Cardians?
12963 : Ohohohohoho! Your impeccable attention to detail pleases me so. But as we lack for time, on to the race, we must go!
12964 : Even these race-bred chocobos shrivel before my Cardian entourage. Compared to the automatons, they're as slow as a splintery river barge.
12965 : Now, I think, we've all had a sufficient preview. So let the race begin, without further ado!
12966 : Ohohohohohoho! Of this inevitable result, I was always assured-- that a Cardian would come away with victory secured!
12967 : The home ground advantage was not in my Cardians' favor. But with some minor adjustments, victory shall be mine to savor.
12968 : H-hey! What do you think you're trying to pull here!?
12969 : My, my, what a pleasant surprise! I'm relieved to see that you are well...and alive.
12970 : How dare you ohoho your way into my hard-earned commentary seat! This is a blatant act of...racejacking! You despicable...racejacker!
12971 : Hush now, we mustn't resort to such hurtful vilification. I merely wished to let you take that much-deserved vacation.
12972 : And you, Goccilo! What were you thinking, replacing me with the likes of her!? And don't you think that I don't notice how you slack off when Sakura isn't here!
12973 : Ahem! W-well folks, that's it for another exciting edition of chocobo racing! Until next time...!
12974 : %, I knew you'd make it all the way here.
12975 : What's with the baffled expression? It's me, Sakura.
12976 : You see, I'm actually a full-grown bird. I've been hiding it all this time, using a transformation item to pose as a cuddly chocobo chick.
12977 : I was separated from my mother at a very young age, and have been with Markovich ever since he found me as a stray chick. But all these years, I've never once given up on finding my real mother.
12978 : I have only a few memories left of her--that she was an accomplished racing chocobo...
12979 : And that she quit racing because she felt the circuit was no longer enough of a challenge.
12980 : I thought that if I could get together a strong enough field of competitors, Mother would be enticed to return to the fray. That's why I'm here today--to seek the best racing chocobos to run in the upcoming Dream Race.
12981 : Working in race commentary as a chick, and now running in this race... Everything has been for the purpose of being reunited with Mother. Not even Markovich knows what I've been doing.
12982 : I intend to invite today's victor to participate in the Dream Race.
12983 : I hope that'll be your chocobo, %!
12984 : And next, we have Sakura. But something seems to be different... Ah, her coat is a different color from when she appeared in the Deadly Race.
12985 : She must have obtained feather dye by trading chocobucks. She sure knows how to doll herself up!
12986 : The next competitor is Scorching Needle, a cactuar whose explosive acceleration is second to none.
12987 : I remember the time when it suddenly ran off on me. Boy, did it give me the runaround! A friendly reminder, folks: Be sure to wear gloves when handling cactuar.
12988 : And now, we come to Albinic Amami, a rabbit boasting jaw-dropping vertical jumping power and silken white fur that is irresistible to the touch.
12989 : It trains by jumping back and forth over my head! Gets me rather dizzy after a while, though.
12990 : And that completes the lineup, folks. With such a colorful combination of creatures, I have a feeling this race won't soon be forgotten by the fans!
12991 : You find %.
12992 : Welcome to the Dream Race, %.
12993 : I've decided to participate in this race as my true self.
12994 : I've always had an inferiority complex about being a different color from other chocobos.
12995 : I wanted to be normal and fit in. That's why I've been dyeing my feathers all these years.
12996 : But no more... If I really want to become champion, I can't continue to avoid coming face to face with my true self.
12997 : This is a lesson I learned from your chocobo.
12998 : I won't hold back in today's race, %.
12999 : Aaah, the chocobo that's been stirring up a storm. I wonder if it has what it takes to go all the way.
13000 : Next in the lineup is the winsome woodenspooner, Keyaki, for whom this will be the first appearance in the Dream Race.
13001 : I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keyaki runs in this race. What is the world coming to?
13002 : Next, we have Sakura...
13003 : Wh-what in the name of the Goddess!? This magnificent white plumage--so pure and beautiful, like freshly fallen snow on the first winter's day!
13004 : Well I'll be... In all my years as zoologist, I have never before laid eyes upon a sight of such splendor!
13005 : ...
13006 : Phew...just getting a hold of myself here, folks. For this race, we will see a return to an all-chocobo affair--the way it's meant to be. What other pleasant surprises can we hope to expect today?
13007 : %, the owner of the winning chocobo, will be awarded %, %, and the exalted title of Chocochampion!
13008 : Even I couldn't have guessed you'd come this far! Congratulations!
13009 : Great race, %. It's hard to admit, but I was completely outclassed by your chocobo.
13010 : But what's more disappointing is, Mother didn't come.. With so many quality racing chocobos here, I was sure she'd appear, but...
13011 : Princess... Princess Sakura!
13012 : Princess...? What are you talking about? Who are you?
13013 : Please pardon your humble servant this sudden intrusion. I, your loyal handmaid, Keyaki, have been in search of Your Highness for the longest time.
13014 : Searching for...me?
13015 : Yes, Your Highness. You are the crown princess in the land of chocobos. Your snow-white plumage is undeniable proof of your royal lineage.
13016 : Are you serious!? Then doesn't this make my mother the queen!?
13017 : That is correct. Your Highness shares the same beautiful white plumage as Her late Majesty the Queen.
13018 : D-did you just say Her late...Majesty...?
13019 : ...! I-I beg your forgiveness, Your Highness...
13020 : Wh...what happened?
13021 : You were but a down-covered chick when the queen departed from this world. You were accompanying Her Majesty on a journey, when a horde of monsters attacked without warning. She protected you from the relentless fiends, but alas, was forced over the cliff face...
13022 : She...she gave up her life to save me?
13023 : Above all else, Her Majesty was known as a loving mother and dutiful queen. However, being the wide-eyed, innocent chick that you were, you instinctively followed your mother over the cliff, never to be seen again. But, I never once gave up hope...
13024 : My search spanned several years and took me to all four corners of Vana'diel. When I learned of the appearance of a new racing chocobo of unrivaled virtuosity, I made haste to the Chocobo Circuit with revived hope. And now...my long search is finally over.
13025 : So that's what happened...
13026 : Princess Sakura, your loyal subjects eagerly await your return. Let us now return to the land of chocobos!
13027 : ...
13028 : I'm sorry, but I can't go.
13029 : Your Highness! But...why!?
13030 : Until the day I triumph over a champion race chocobo like %'s, I won't be worthy to become Queen.
13031 : What's more...
13032 : I just can't leave poor Markovich here alone by himself. Behind that spirited facade, he really is a lonely old man...
13033 : I understand your concerns completely, Your Highness. I shall remain here until you are ready to make your return to the land of chocobos.
13034 : What...?
13035 : The only place I belong is here, beside you.
13036 : And I suppose you won't be taking no for an answer? I'll have you know that there'll be no free-riders here. If you're planning to stay, you're going to have to train your feathers off, is that clear?
13037 : I would not have it any other way, Your Highness!
13038 : Heehee! Then what are you waiting for? Give me ten laps, on the double!
13039 : %, I'm looking forward to our rematch! Until then, don't even think about disappearing anywhere, you hear?
13040 : You're still here, eh, %?
13041 : Call it fatherly bias, but don't you think Sakura looks stunning in white?
13042 : What? How did I know that the full-grown white chocobo was actually Sakura, you ask?
13043 : Hohoho... It's not so difficult when you've been a zoologist almost your entire life. Chocobos may age, and their color change, but each will always have their own unique way of walking.
13044 : I've also always known that Sakura was searching for her mother. I only wish that I could have done more to help her...
13045 : Eh? What's this talk about the land of chocobos? No, I'm afraid I've never heard of such a place before.
13046 : Sakura is the queen, you say?
13047 : <Chuckle> That girl's just full of surprises. But to fall from grace at such an early age like that... Not a single day goes by without my heart going out to her.
13048 : You know what they say: Home is where the heart is. To the racing chocobos, each of the VCS's farms may very well be their own land of chocobos.
13049 : And you, our new Chocochampion! Don't forget that this title symbolizes the beginning, and not the end of your journey in chocobo racing.
13050 : Always do your best, and never forget those who have helped you get to where you are today. These are the simple wishes of a frail old man.
13051 : And they're off!
13052 : Hrmmm! [Both/All of the] contestants have gotten off to a great start!
13053 : Professor Shantotto, what did you think of the start?
13054 : All of the chocobos started well, in my general observance. But faced against my Cardians, that won't make the tiniest difference.
13055 : Ah! It looks like one of the contestants was slow out of the gate! Will it be able to catch up in time!?
13056 : Oh no! It looks like we have an accident on the field! One of the contestants has its feet caught in some mud. Can it get back on track in time!?
13057 : looks unstoppable! I would be surprised if it was affected by any further attacks.
13058 : The speed of the other contestants has begun to drop! Who could have predicted such a turn of events!?
13059 : The nearby contestants are beginning to look confused! I doubt if they will be able to use any more items!
13060 : And yet the other contestants seem completely unaffected by the attack!
13061 : It's crowded up front with # contestants still fighting for the lead! Which one will break through!?
13062 : It's crowded up front with all # contestants still fighting for the lead!
13063 : The two contestants are neck and neck! This could be a screenshot finish!
13064 : What's this!?  has used %!
13065 : still holds on to the lead. Can it take it all the way to the finish!?
13066 : is starting to lag behind! Does it have enough energy left to make that final dash for the cash!?
13067 : It doesn't look like anyone will be catching  today!
13068 : What's this?  is making its move on the lead!
13069 : #:
13070 : What's this!? 's using [Sheep Charge/Dust Cloud/Healing Breeze/Gloeosuccus/Ram Rage/Sprightly Step/Roar/Repair Wave/Shadow Wave/Slow Wave/Siphon Wave/Wild Carrot/Blaster/Mad Dash]!
13071 : Whoooa nellie! Some kind of refreshing breeze has got those [monsters/Cardians] looking light on their feet now!
13072 : just went into a fiery rage! You gotta be kidding me! Look at that burst in speed! And fending off attacks from the other chocobos like nobody's business!
13073 : I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is different about 's step.  And the attacks of the other participants don't seem to be having any effect!
13074 : And here's some unexpected drama, folks! The Cardians are now completely immune to the attacks of the chocobos! How will this play out!?
13075 : Look at that! 's stride looks like it has just gotten an injection of added oomph!
13076 : Uh-oh, what's going on here!? The chocobos are looking like they had their saddles lined with lead all of a sudden!
13077 : Oooh! In a bold move,  has just used a [Dream Cracker/Dream Apple]!
13078 : What's this!? All of the chocobos other than  and Sakura have broken stride and seem to have had the steam taken out of their step!
13079 : Thanks to that brazen little act,  can expect to maintain endurance, increase speed, and fend off attacks! That just might seal the deal for !
13080 : Never in all my days, race fans! In a botched attempt to slow down the opposing chocobos, the King of Trophies has just impaired the speed of all the Cardians instead!
13081 : How could my creation make such a rookie mistake? In a bout of Cardian disassembly this King shall surely partake!
13082 : Shantotto starts casting Tornado!
13083 : The speed of the chocobos has dropped!
13084 : The stamina of the chocobos has dropped!
13085 : The evasion rate of the chocobos has dropped!
13086 : Pr-Professor Shantotto, are you out of your mind!? What in the world do you think you're doing!?
13087 : Why, my dear Goccilo, we mustn't be so quick to place the blame. This mishap was probably caused by reckless adventurers playing at their game.
13088 : What marvels could possibly lie in store for us today? I've heard it being said that today's [creatures/Cardians] have quite the arsenal of abilities at their disposal. This could get heavy, folks!
13089 : All of the contestants certainly appear to have quite a bit of steam left in them. Are they holding back? Could they possibly be working in cahoots with one another!?
13090 : It seems as though there has been a general quickening of pace amongst the participants!
13091 : There's still plenty of race to go, race fans! More than enough time for an awe-inspiring accident or some downright nasty drama!
13092 : And it looks as though the contestants have have settled in and found their groove!
13093 : The racers look to have gotten themselves into a bit of a rut now. This could make or break the race! Let's see if they can manage to pull through!
13094 : This is where it really pays off to have an edge in endurance over your opponent. Let's see if any contestants have the discipline to save some steam for the home stretch!
13095 : And here's where we get down to the nitty-gritty! Let's see if some of our racers can provide a flamboyant finish for us here today!
13096 : And there they go! A clear boost in speed for the lot of them! But will they have the endurance to maintain their new pace for long?
13097 : I am at a loss for words, folks! It's just too hard to call! Which racer will Lady Luck see fit to shine upon today!?
13098 : It's painfully obvious that those thoroughbreds have nothing but the finish line in their sights now! The time for a final spurt is now or never!
13099 : And here they come down the home stretch! How is this one going to end up!?
13100 : You see a single, ivory venture roll die on the table. There are currently #/# other players wishing to participate.
13101 : What would you like to do? Join table (# gil). Leave. Read manual.
13102 : There are currently #/# players at the table. Please wait a moment until the remaining participants have arrived. (You may still leave the table at any time.)
13103 : You place # gil in the pot.
13104 : The final participant has arrived. Your group is allowed # [minute/minutes] at the table.
13105 : %'s primary roll is #!
13106 : Double up? (Currently: #) Yes. No.
13107 : % doubles up... Your venture roll total is now #!
13108 : % doubles up... BUST!!!
13109 : % holds fast.
13110 : Double up complete.
13111 : Results...
13112 : %'s final total is #!
13113 : % has gone BUST!
13114 : The game has ended in a draw!
13115 : The winner is %!
13116 : Someone has dropped the die down the drain! You can no longer continue playing.
13117 : The final place at the table has already been taken.
13118 : You do not have enough gil.
13119 : Someone has dropped the die!
13120 : Read which chapter? 1. The Heart of Venture Roll. 2. Rules of the Roll. 3. Putting the Book Down.
13121 : Venture roll is a competitive game played with dice similar to those used by corsairs. The objective is to roll until your cumulative total comes as close to 11 as possible without going over.
13122 : Until you reach or go over 11, you may continue rolling (doubling up) as many times as the table time limit allows (# [minute/minutes], Earth time).
13123 : In addition to doubling up, you may also decline to roll the dice and stay with your current total (hold fast).
13124 : If your total ever goes over 11, you will automatically lose the game, regardless of the totals of other players. Knowing the right time to hold fast is one of the keys to staying in the match.
13125 : Once all the players have held fast, the game is over and the results are announced. The player closest to 11 is declared the winner and receives all the gil in the pot (the original participation fees of all the players).
13126 : Objective: Roll a six-sided die as many times as necessary to achieve a total as close to 11 as possible. You lose the instant your total exceeds 11.
13127 : If two or more players are the closest to 11 at the end of a match, the game is considered a draw and all participation fees are repaid in full.
13128 : Once the game has started, fees will not be refunded for any reason unless the match results in a draw.
13129 : Hey, I remember you! You're that [fellow/lady] that helped me round up all those new recruits...I think. I'm not that good with faces...
13130 : No wait, I remember now! You took one of our badges around Windurst and got people talking about the Sentinels...I think. You adventurers look so much alike...
13131 : Anyway, as a way to say thanks for all the help I think I recall you doing for us, the president herself has given me the OK to teleport you directly to Aht Urhgan Whitegate at any time you like!
13132 : All you have to do is trade me the tiny fee of # gil, and we can be on our way!
13133 : Alright, it looks like everything is in order.
13134 : Now hold on!
13135 : Visit the Chocobo Circuit? Off to the races! Not right now.
13136 : The door is locked...
13137 : I am Zahsa Syalmhaia, captain of the mercenaries in charge of defending East Sarutabaruta.
13138 : And now, a question for you, adventurer--might you know the reason why Windurst's Mithran population is concentrated in the Woods district?
13139 : Hmph! Then I shall enlighten you. The area was given to us as a reward for our exceptional performance during the Great War!
13140 : I am Zahsa Syalmhaia, captain of the mercenaries in charge of defending East Sarutabaruta.
13141 : And now, a question for you, adventurer--do you know of the stone maws being found across the land? Some might describe them as cavernous.
13142 : Hmph! Then I shall enlighten you. They are large statues of hideous visage, and have been around for some time. These maws are more than they appear, I guarantee you.
13143 : Oh my!
13144 : That wristband!
13145 : Why, if it isn't one of the charm bracelets I crafty-wafted for our stalwartaru soldiers back in the days of the Great War!
13146 : Ahhh...just seeing it really bringy-wings me back. Though I see that two of the threads have come undone.
13147 : Look at how they dangle from your wristaru. The shape they form almost looks like a ladle...ah!
13148 : ...That reminds me. You must be curious about the secretaru of the third string.
13149 : A ladle with a holey-wole in it... This is said to represent the mystic power of Lake Tepokalipuka's waters.
13150 : A secret once known to my ancestarus, but long since lost to the ages...
13151 : And yet somehow, I feel that I finally understand... Tepoka...lipuka... Yes, it musty-wust be--
13152 : Master Pononooo! You promised you'd give me some pointarus on my weaving technique!
13153 : Oh! How could I forgetaru?
13154 : I wish I had more time to chat, but an artisan's guild comes first and foremostaru, you see. Please excusey-wuse me, and do take care!
13155 : It's here! It's here! The season of Celestial Nights is upon us! And to celebrate, the moogles are bringing together lost loves by offering free teleportation to San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst!
13156 : If there's someone you've been longing to see, just let me know and I'll warp you right to their side (provided they are in either San d'Oria, Bastok, or Windurst), kupo!
13157 : Where would you like to go? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
13158 : See you again, kupo!
13159 : Oh, that's right! I almost forgot to give you this, kupo!
13160 : Are you ready for another spine-chilling, stomach-churning test of your mettle, kupo!?
13161 : We've set up a secret marker somewhere in the bowels of a dreadful dungeon. Your goal is to reach that marker alive, kupo!
13162 : Oh, a new adventurer! Best of luck, kupo!
13163 : Are you helping out the new adventurers? Best of luck in your endeavors, kupo!
13164 : Here's your reward for reaching the goal, kupo!
13165 : The face in the portrait you brought me is just... Kupupupu!
13166 : You took another dive into the dreaded dungeon, kupo? Well, you deserve a little something for your preternatural perseverance, kupo.
13167 : This isn't enough to prove you reached the goal as a dungeon-delving duo. You have to bring me the item your partner received to show that you were both successful, kupo!
13168 : To go on this fright-filled face-off with fear, you need a partner who can prove you reached the goal. Come back when you have a buddy in bravery, kupo!
13169 : This adventure into adversity is only available to two-person parties. Split up into pairs and talk to me again, kupo!
13170 : Please come back with a different partner. It'll be no fun to scare you if your reactions are too similar, kupo!
13171 : Your partner isn't ready to go. Please wait a little longer, kupo.
13172 : Your partner must talk to me as well. I'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready, kupo.
13173 : You can only choose one partner a day. Come back again tomorrow, kupo!
13174 : Hold up there! It looks like your candidate for courageous companionship has already got a partner! You can't choose that person at the moment, kupo!
13175 : Please wait a little longer or find a new partner before coming back, kupo.
13176 : Are you ready to test your courage, kupo?
13177 : Are you ready to go? Ready, kupo! I'm too terrified, kupo!
13178 : I'll be checking to see if you reached the goal. You can use this magical scroll to make a speedy return to town, kupo.
13179 : If you both succeed, I'll have a prize waiting for you! Now, off you go, kupo!
13180 : You can only carry one %.
13181 : Are you participating in this petrifying pilgrimage with the person in your present party?
13182 : Hey, you changed partners! You can't switch halfway through, kupo!
13183 : Wait, the number of people in your party has changed! You have to be in a two-person party, kupo!
13184 : Choose your partner wisely. Come back when you think you have a winning combo, kupo!
13185 : Adventurer! Adventurer!
13186 : Might you lend a poor Moogle a hand? Sure! Doing what? Not today.
13187 : A thousand thanks, kupo! Your participation in the Neo Crystal War will benefit your nation in ways beyond imagination!
13188 : Rules? Why, they are simple, my friend! All you need do is sneak your way into beastman lairs and retrieve shards from the cyclopean crystals located about the strongholds, kupo!
13189 : Which lairs? Must I tell you everything, adventurer? Moogle intelligence reports that the crystals can be found in the Ghelsba Outpost, Davoi, the Palborough Mines, Giddeus, Beadeaux, and Castle Oztroja. Now what are you waiting for, kupo!?
13190 : You see, recently there has been much unrest amongst our many Moogle factions, kupo.
13191 : Why, you ask? Well, at one of our gatherings, an argument broke out regarding the Crystal War 20 years gone.
13192 : It all started with the question: which nation played the biggest role in the allied forces' victory over the beastmen armies?
13193 : And from there things degraded into a shouting match pitting San d'Oria versus Bastok versus Windurst, kupo...
13194 : However, at the end of the day, no one could present hard evidence to the claim of their nation's greatness.
13195 : And that is when one of our elders came up with a foolproof method to put an end to our doubts--we would have adventurers from all three nations fight the war again, kupo!
13196 : By fighting, I don't mean fighting each other, but fighting the beastmen like our fathers did 20 years ago!
13197 : One of the ways the allied armies were able to defeat the enemy was by intercepting and cutting off the Shadow Lord's crystal supply routes.
13198 : We want you and other adventurers from across Vana'diel to take on the roles of allied solders and infiltrate beastman strongholds, kupo.
13199 : Once inside, you are to locate large formations where the beastmen have been storing crystals over the past two decades...
13200 : ...and break off as many shards as possible, then bring them back here, kupo.
13201 : The nation that brings back the most shards will be declared the Crystal War's Most Valuable Nation and the Moogles' squabbles will finally come to an end.
13202 : So, what do you say, kupo? I'm in. Maybe later.
13203 : Kupopo... Did I mention that there will be wondrous prizes to adventurers from the victorious nation? Oh well, if you have a change of heart, you'll know where to find me!
13204 : Kupopo...
13205 : Welcome back, adventurer! Let me see how many shards you have retrieved, kupo...
13206 : My records show that you have brought your nation a total of # [shard/shards], but I know you're not done yet, are you?
13207 : Amazing! You've already collected # [shard/shards], kupo! I think I have something extra special for you!
13208 : Here's a little something to keep you motivated, kupo!
13209 : Why are you talking to me? You should be out there aiding [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s fight to prove you are better than those [San d'Orians/Bastokers/Windurstians], kupo!
13210 : Congratulations on your victory, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian]! Your nation has been selected Crystal War MVN, kupo! As a reward, I shall teleport you to any nation of your choice!
13211 : Where would like to go, kupo? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
13212 : Happy travels, kupo!
13213 : Moogles from across Vana'diel have heard of [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst]'s recent success in collecting crystal shards, and have come bearing gifts! For the next few days, [San d'Orian/Bastoker/Windurstian] vendors will be selling specialty goods from everywhere imaginable, kupo!
13214 : Oooh! It's %! Your shard-collecting skills have left us Moogles in awe. It's my honor to present you with this special present, kupo!
13215 : ***GM Commands*** ***Use with CAUTION!***
13216 : Set this area's A flag to: Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
13217 : Switch on this area's B flag? No (OFF). Yes (ON).
13218 : Flag settings complete. A Flag: [Nowhere/San/Bas/Win] B Flag: [OFF/ON]
13219 : The Starlight Celebration is here again, kupo!
13220 : And once again, we have a pile of presents for all the adventurers!
13221 : But we've sailed into a slight snag, kupo... There are so many adventurers that we've become...a little...confused...
13222 : Hey! Maybe you could help us find the right adventurer for each present, kupo!
13223 : I'm sure that if we could just meet them in person, we'd remember which gift was meant for whom. All you have to do is make a party with another adventurer, and then visit a moogle, kupo!
13224 : We're counting on you, kupo!
13225 : The recipient for this present was supposed to be [level 37 or lower/level 38 or higher].
13226 : And I'm pretty sure we were looking for [a male Hume/a female Hume/a male Elvaan/a female Elvaan/a male Tarutaru/a female Tarutaru/a Mithra/a Galka].
13227 : Someone who was trained as [a warrior/a monk/a white mage/a black mage/a red mage/a thief/a paladin/a dark knight/a beastmaster/a bard/a ranger/a samurai/a ninja/a dragoon/a summoner/a blue mage/a corsair/a puppetmaster/a dancer/a scholar]...
13228 : If you're having trouble finding the person we're looking for, it's okay to give up for now, kupo.
13229 : Give up for now? That would be best. Not just yet!
13230 : Yeah, that's a tough one, kupo. But I have plenty of other presents here if you'd still like to help!
13231 : Hmmm...I don't think this is the person we're looking for, kupo.
13232 : Hmmm...this isn't the person we're looking for, kupo. But, you know what? I think something's coming back to me...
13233 : Oh, I stumbled across the present that was meant for the adventurer you brought with you, kupo!
13234 : Presents can be claimed using a card just like this! Have your adventurer friend show the card to a moogle and receive a wonderful gift, kupo!
13235 : Yes! This is the person I was looking for, kupo!
13236 : Hand this card to your friend. It can be given to a moogle in exchange for a present, kupo!
13237 : Your help was invaluable! Here, this is for you, kupo!
13238 : There are still so many presents to hand out, kupo! Don't be shy about lending another helping hand!
13239 : I'm so glad we found you! Here's your present, kupo!
13240 : What are you trying to pull, kupo!? Give this card to the person it's addressed to, and have them come to a moogle to receive a present!
13241 : One card at a time! I'm confused enough as it is, kupo!
13242 : Through this archway lies Windurst's residential area. There is a Mog House room preparrred for your use in there.
13243 : Beyond this arrrchway is Windurst's residential area, where there are Mog Houses and Rent-a-Rooms available for people's use.
13244 : A Mog House is your own perrrsonal apartment room provided for your convenience.
13245 : Within your Mog House, you can storrre items, change jobs, and heal your HP and MP.
13246 : It's your own room, so you can use it however you see fit. Why don't you go up there now and take a little nap to refrrresh yourself?
13247 : Oh well... Yourrr loss.
13248 : Anything I can help you with?
13249 : The Mog Houses of the following party members are open for visits.
13250 : Rrright this way.
13251 : What do you wish to do? Nothing in particular. Ask for an explanation of Mog Houses. Visit the Mog House of a party member.
13252 : Whose Mog House will you visit? Never mind.
13253 : That Mog House is not currently open for visits.
13254 : Hellooo! Welcome to the Chocobo Chick Catchery!
13255 : What would you like to do? Learn how to play. Check current high score. Have a go! Nothing.
13256 : Catch as many chicks as you can by moving the chocobo left and rightaru. But make sure you don't pick up any mandragoras by mistakey-wake! That'll mean the end of the game!
13257 : You need to catch at leastaru 20 chicks in one minute to clear the game.
13258 : Current high score: # [chick/chicks]. Record holder: %.
13259 : It's # gil to play.
13260 : Play the game? (You have # gil.) Play. Don't play.
13261 : Thank you, and good luck!
13262 : Move which direction? Right. Left.
13263 : [Excellentaru!/Awww...] You caught # [chick/chicks].
13264 : Well, whataru do you know? It's a new record!
13265 : Here's your hard-earned prize.
13266 : I'll see you again.
13267 : Ahhh! A premature exitaru!
13268 : You're not supposed to catch mandragoras.
13269 : Phew...is it just me, or is it getting hot in here? Man, you look greataru in that bathing suit! You should try playing the game in hard mode!
13270 : Phew...is it just me, or is it getting hot in here? Man, you look greataru in that yukata! You should try playing the game in hard mode!
13271 : Phew...is it just me, or is it getting hot in here? Man, you look greataru in that happi! You should try playing the game in hard mode!
13272 : Phew...is it just me, or is it getting hot in here? Man, you look greataru in that outfit! You should try playing the game in hard mode!
13273 : What would you like to do? Learn how to play. Check current high score. Play normal mode. Try hard mode. Nothing.
13274 : In normal mode, you need to catch only 20 chicks in one minute to clear the game.
13275 : But it's no cakewalk in hard mode. You'll need at leastaru 35!
13276 : Check high score for which mode? Normal mode. Hard mode. Don't check.
13277 : Normal mode high score: # [chick/chicks]. Record holder: %.
13278 : Hard mode high score: # [chick/chicks]. Record holder: %.
13279 : Here's the reward for your efforts. And a bonus balloon, justaru for you!
13280 : Huh? Did the heat just ease off a notchy-wotch? I'll bet it was you, adventurer. Why don'taru you hang around and take on hard mode?
13281 : You're on fire, adventurer! A red-hotaru display like that deserves a cool, cool prize. Here you go!
13282 : Hey, did you see the show being held at town square?
13283 : The sensational new starlet, Mumor, is performing! You have to go and cheer her on, kupo!
13284 : The sensational new starlet, Uka, is performing! You have to go and cheer her on, kupo!
13285 : Kupopo!? The bathing suit you're wearing...it's a prize from the show!
13286 : Kupopo!? The yukata you're wearing...it's a prize from the show!
13287 : Kupopo!? The happi you're wearing...it's a prize from the show!
13288 : The outfit you're wearing...it's a prize from the show!
13289 : Thank you so much for helping out our Mumor, kupo.
13290 : Thank you so much for helping out our Uka, kupo.
13291 : To show our appreciation, I'll warp you to one of the other nations, kupo! Where do you want to go?
13292 : Where will you go? Nowhere. San d'Oria. Bastok. Windurst.
13293 : Enjoy your trip, kupo!
13294 : Kupopo!? Is that a wind charm you have there?
13295 : Looks like you've really gotten into the spirit of the Sunbreeze Festival, kupo!
13296 : As a show of appreciation, I'll teleport you to one of the other nations! Tell me where you'd like to go, kupo.
13297 : Greetings and well met! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service.
13298 : Greetings and well met! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service.
13299 : Greetings and well met! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service.
13300 : My station is to help along those new to the life of an adventurer in Vana'diel. I specialize in the types of fundamental knowledge necessary for success in such endeavors, as well as related methods of pedagogy. With my aid, you can rest assured that your first steps down the adventurer's path will not go astray.
13301 : Should you still consider yourself a newcomer, I would highly recommend that you make full use of my services.
13302 : This is my permanent post, and I never leave it. Remember it well. Whenever you need a hand with anything, anything at all, don't hesitate to come calling.
13303 : So, are you interested in some entry-level duties to put you well on your way to greatness? Not to worry, I've got just the thing for you!
13304 : Go talk to the guard Aravoge just over yonder and have him cast Signet on you. Then come back and see me.
13305 : Go talk to the guard Rabid Wolf over yonder and have him cast Signet on you. Then come back and see me.
13306 : Go talk to the guard Harara over yonder and have her cast Signet on you. Then come back and see me.
13307 : Well, it looks like you were able to get your Signet. Easy enough, yes?
13308 : As long as Signet is in effect, there is always a possibility that you will obtain crystals from any enemies that you defeat. There are also other more concrete benefits, such as increased defense and evasion.
13309 : Signet even helps you when not engaged in combat with an enemy. For example, it boosts the rate at which healing occurs while at rest. For all of these reasons and more, you should consider it essential to have Signet cast on you at all times.
13310 : Very well, then! As a reward for successful completion of your first assignment I would like to present you with these %.
13311 : There is more here than meats the eye! That was a joke... Anyway, this is a type of item known amongst adventurers as a meal. This meal in particular will temporarily enhance your attack power when eaten.
13312 : Whenever any type of meal is consumed, you will receive some such temporary status bonus. Naturally, different meals grant different types of bonuses.
13313 : For the most part, meat dishes will affect attack power. Conversely, seafood dishes generally enhance defense, and so on and so forth. Take care to select dishes best suited to your purpose.
13314 : One thing you should make note of, however, is that you cannot eat a meal while another meal's status bonus is still in effect. Your stomach would simply burst!
13315 : Hmmm, that's quite a lot to cover... Are you with me so far?
13316 : So far so good? Explain Signet again. Explain meals again. This is a breeze.
13317 : Great! Well, talking can only prepare you so much. Let's get right down to it. Go ahead and pop one of those %!
13318 : After eating a meal, a status icon designated as Food will appear in the upper-left portion of your screen. Come back and talk to me again once you've confirmed that it's there.
13319 : Check out the full belly on you! Well done! Signet and meals can both play crucial roles whenever you take on any type of enemy. This is a key lesson that you would do well not to forget!
13320 : Next, let's get those pristine hands of yours nice and dirty! No sense in letting that food go to waste now, is there? Let's send you out to fight a monster on a full stomach!
13321 : Exiting through that gate over there will lead you into an area with hostile enemies.
13322 : Try to target one of the monsters and then select the Check option from your menu. This will help you ascertain an enemy's level of difficulty and make sure they are not too strong. A smart adventurer picks [his/her] fights.
13323 : Be warned. Engaging any enemy that checks as very tough or above will result in your Signet not granting you the defense and evasion bonuses you would otherwise receive.
13324 : And that brings us to your next assignment!
13325 : It's high time you learned how to use a weapon skill!
13326 : Perhaps you've already noticed, but sometimes while fighting an enemy, your skills will rise little by little.
13327 : When your skill with the weapon you are wielding reaches a predetermined value, weapon skills will become available for use.
13328 : Combo for those adept with hand-to-hand weapons. Wasp Sting for those who fight with daggers. Fast Blade for those who prefer the sword.
13329 : Shining Strike for wielders of the club. Heavy Swing for those who take up the staff. And on, and on, and on...
13330 : Selecting Status from the main menu will bring up the Combat Skl. option. This will display all of the current skill values in all weapon categories.
13331 : The first weapon skill for each weapon type can be learned at a skill value of 5. So make that your first goal, and we'll take it from there!
13332 : Ohhh! Somebody went and learned a new weapon skill, didn't [he/she]? Very good!
13333 : I can see by that twinkle in your eyes that you've already used it on some poor, unfortunate creature, but I'll explain just a bit more. Whenever your Tactical Points (TP) reach 1000 or more, selecting Abilities and then Weapon Skl. from the menu will display a list of usable weapon skills.
13334 : These are deadly techniques capable of rendering massive damage on enemies. It is well worth an adventurer's time to learn and master them.
13335 : Ah, by the way, were you fortunate enough to receive some items from the monsters you fought?
13336 : If you were lucky enough to come across any %, make sure you hang onto them. They may pay dividends later on...
13337 : Also, that reminds me. There is another lesson better learned sooner than later. The items you will no doubt come across known as crystals, such as % and %, are extremely significant.
13338 : They are truly versatile items that can be used for a number of purposes. These include trading them to guards for certain rewards, and selling them to earn money, just to name a few.
13339 : For now, I'd like to explain more about another of their uses. Namely, the role they play in synthesis.
13340 : But first things first. Your reward for completing your last assignment! Here you are, then. %, %, and last but not least, %.
13341 : Now, using % will bring up the synthesis interface. Once there, select the % and % as the ingredients to be added.
13342 : All that remains is to select the OK option, and the synthesis will commence!
13343 : You'll find that the crafting process will never begin, should the ingredients you've selected not form a viable synthesis recipe. Also, even when your materials are correct, there is always a chance that your synthesis will fail, so please be wary.
13344 : The majority of items which you create via synthesis, as well as most of those dropped by enemies you defeat, can be placed on the Auction House for sale.
13345 : The auction house is an ultra-consumer venue where you can attempt to purchase the wares of other players by placing bids, as well as have other players bid on items you have put up for sale.
13346 : My words alone can do no justice to the vast cornucopia of goods that is the auction house. One simply must see it with one's own eyes.
13347 : Are you still with me? Explain synthesis again. Explain the auction house again. Sure am.
13348 : Somewhere in this great city lies our nation's auction house. Seek it out, and report back to me when you have found it.
13349 : You needn't worry about going through with an actual purchase. Simply examining any of the Auction Counters will more than suffice.
13350 : So, you were able to locate the auction house! Pretty hard to miss, isn't it?
13351 : What do you think? It is as I said, yes? Few organizations in this world exceed the auction house in scale. It will never cease to be of use to you throughout your adventures. It would be wise to become adept at using it.
13352 : And now down to brass tacks! Let's see if we can't get you to up some levels!
13353 : There are several items in existence which serve to enhance the number of experience points you receive for defeating enemies.
13354 : For example, there are %, %, and %, just to name a few.
13355 : These are a bit unique in that you must wait a certain amount of time after equipping them before you may use them.
13356 : There is also a predetermined amount of time, usually quite long, that must pass before these items can be used again. The total number of times you may use any single item is also limited, so be mindful of that as well.
13357 : Many of these items may be obtained from the same guards that provide you with Signet. You need only exchange Conquest Points in order to acquire them.
13358 : As a matter of fact, for finishing that last assignment, I'm going to give you this %. With this, you'll be able to obtain % without having to use any of your Conquest Points.
13359 : Head over to any guard and have a go at exchanging them for something. And after that, see if you can't make it all the way up to level four. I'll be right here waiting for you when you get back.
13360 : With an experience bonus in place, it should take you practically no time at all. Good luck, and be careful! It can get quite hairy out there!
13361 : Well, well, well! We might make an adventurer out of you just yet! Looks like we've almost washed all that green off of you.
13362 : A bit of bad news now, though. Starting from level 31, anytime you are knocked unconscious your experience points will suffer a deduction.
13363 : As a general rule, the amount penalized will be about 10% of the total amount required to reach the next level. You have to be more careful than ever from here on out!
13364 : However, there are ways to minimize this loss of experience points.
13365 : Like this, for example. Go on, take it. Your reward for reaching level four. It's called %.
13366 : Using this will grant you a status known as Reraise. Whenever you are rendered unconscious while this effect is in place, you will have the option to revive yourself.
13367 : Choosing to do so will cause you to be resuscitated in the very spot where you have fallen. In addition, as I stated previously, the amount of experience points you lose will be somewhat lessened.
13368 : % and similar items work in the same manner as the % and the other experience bonus items I mentioned earlier. That is, once equipped, you must wait a certain period of time before they can be used, and there are both cooldown timers and limited charges as well.
13369 : All of these items as a whole are collectively referred to as enchanted items. There is a vast array of other enchanted items with myriad other effects that will prove useful on your adventures. It may be worth the time and effort to better acquaint yourself with them at some point.
13370 : It seems you're starting to get the hang of things. Next, I'd like for you to go and fight some enemies in [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon].
13371 : [La Theine Plateau/The Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] is located beyond the [southern/northern/northern] reaches of [West Ronfaure/North Gustaberg/East Sarutabaruta].
13372 : You're sure to encounter some new monsters there that you won't find prowling around the outskirts of the city. It may be a bit daunting, so I'll only require that you slay one such beast, and then head on back.
13373 : Just keep in mind, the farther you stray from the city, the more ferocious monsters tend to be. Don't say I didn't warn you.
13374 : Make sure to use the Check command to determine the strength of your enemy. If you find that you are surrounded by enemies too difficult for you, try heading back to a previous area closer to the city and leveling up a bit more first.
13375 : I know those smells... You smell of victory! And of [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon]! Good on you, %.
13376 : But by now you must be getting sick and tired of fighting the same old monsters so close to the city walls, aren't you?
13377 : If you are several levels beyond a monster and totally outclass them in every respect, checking them will yield a too weak to be worthwhile result.
13378 : Killing monsters so far beneath you is borderline cowardice, and will net you no experience points.
13379 : If you start to notice more and more of these too weak monsters around you, consider moving farther from the city to a more difficult area.
13380 : Congratulations on another milestone! Reward tiiime! You've just earned yourself # experience points, hotshot.
13381 : Let's dive right into your next assignment while that blood is still pumping!
13382 : I'm going to up the stakes here a little bit, %. But it's for your own good. I want you to go out and get all the way to level ten.
13383 : Considering your current level and the knowledge you have, you shouldn't confine yourself to the immediate vicinity of the city. You're more than capable of besting monsters in [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon] at this point.
13384 : I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. So how's it feel? You're moving on up in the world. Time to put some money in those pockets. A #-gil reward, just for you. Don't spend it all in one place.
13385 : By now you should be relatively familiar with the basics of battle. Am I right or am I right?
13386 : But don't go getting too cocky! This world is chock-full of monsters just waiting for the opportune moment to pounce and knock you out cold!
13387 : Depending on the type of monster, there are several factors that could cause them to attack you without provocation. I'll enumerate some of the more common types of this blatantly aggressive behavior for you.
13388 : For starters, and most obviously, there are monsters which detect by sight. They will attack you whenever you enter their field of vision. This is the most prevalent type. They simply cannot stand the sight of adventurers.
13389 : Next, there are those monsters which detect by sound. They can be a bit more dangerous than visually-dependent monsters, in that they will attack the source of any sound within a certain prescribed radius. You may not think it, but there are a great many monsters whose aural senses are far more developed than their sense of sight.
13390 : There are also monsters which detect their enemies' spellcasting. Much like the sound-detecting types, these monsters will attack the source of any magic casting within a certain radius of their being. Not surprisingly, many monsters in the arcana family rely heavily on this method of detection, which covers a comparatively larger range than the aforementioned sense of hearing.
13391 : And finally, there are opportunistic monsters which prey upon the weak and near-dead, pinpointing their prey by detecting low hit points. The family of undead creatures abound in monsters of this type. Even more distressing, the fewer the hit points you have, the farther the distance from which you can be detected.
13392 : Your next assignment will attempt to familiarize you with these detection methods, and train you to become adept at avoiding them.
13393 : I want you to travel once again to [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], and retrieve an item known as a Gate Crystal.
13394 : Near the center of [La Theine Plateau/the Konschtat Highlands/Tahrongi Canyon], you will find a large, white, almost otherworldly structure. On the area map, it is labeled as the [Crag of Holla/Crag of Dem/Crag of Mea].
13395 : There you will find one of an enormous series of crystals known as Telepoints. Simply examine the telepoint you find there, and bring back your findings.
13396 : Only when you present your % to me shall your assignment be complete.
13397 : Exercise the utmost caution. There are many extremely dangerous monsters in the area you will be visiting. And take extra care not to draw the attention of any beastmen.
13398 : This shall be your final assignment. Go now, and may the Goddess watch over you.
13399 : Ahhh, the %, just as I requested. Excellent work, %.
13400 : And now for some information regarding this little beauty. As long as you have this %, you will be able to be transported by the appropriate spell of teleportation directly to the telepoint from which you retrieved it.
13401 : I doubt that you will have many opportunities to use it for the time being, but you would do well to remember what I have said.
13402 : Several such telepoints exist, scattered throughout Vana'diel. Each has its own specific gate crystal, which you will receive the first time that you examine any of them.
13403 : Let me take this time to offer you a most heartfelt congratulations, %! You have successfully completed all of the assignments I have laid before you.
13404 : And here I have a most fitting reward for you. A gift of # experience points, and # %.
13405 : I fear that I have nothing more to teach you. From now on, your lessons will best be learned by giving a mindful ear to others and being ever observant on your travels.
13406 : Do remember, though, that the paths open before you will multiply greatly should you cooperate with other adventurers.
13407 : Leveling, for example, is an endeavor made immeasurably more efficient and enjoyable in the company of others. It helps to not only guarantee you some modicum of safety in numbers, but also rewards you with considerably more experience points than adventuring alone.
13408 : I suppose it does require a good deal of courage to approach an adventurer you do not know, but I strongly encourage you to do so. It may prove to be the beginning of an extremely rewarding and long-lasting friendship.
13409 : There may still be some small facets of adventuring that I can continue to offer you advice on. Should you ever have any questions or anxieties, please do not hesitate to come and see me again. I will do my best to be of service and set your heart at ease.
13410 : Go now, and go well. The world awaits its next great adventurer, %.
13411 : Good day to you! Guardian of the Kingdom, Alaune, at your most humble service. Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?
13412 : Good day to you! Defender of the Republic, Gulldago, at your most humble service. Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?
13413 : Good day to you! Protector of the Federation, Selele, at your most humble service.. Is there something in particular I can help you with this day?
13414 : What will you ask about? Nothing just now. Search comments. Skillchains. Magic bursts. Skillchains and elements.
13415 : Just as their name implies, search comments are original messages composed by adventurers which are readily visible to others when using the search function.
13416 : There are several different categories of search comments. These include, but are not limited to, EXP Party, Items, and Missions and Quests.
13417 : Opening the Search function from the Main Menu and then selecting the Comment option will allow you to conduct a player search by comment type.
13418 : For example, if you would like to search for other players to form a leveling party, you need only select EXP Party from the list displayed.
13419 : Conversely, if you would like to advertise yourself as interested in being on the receiving end of an experience party invite, you can choose the Edit Comment command from the Search menu.
13420 : Of course, search comment composition differs from person to person. You might want to conduct a search first to see what type of search comments are considered the norm before writing your own.
13421 : Skillchains are devastating elemental phenomena which manifest themselves when weapon skills are carried out in a precise and well-timed order.
13422 : The very natures of the skillchains themselves differ widely, being dependent upon the weapon skills used and the order of their execution.
13423 : To take a simple and timeless example, using the weapon skill Red Lotus Blade immediately after Fast Blade will yield a type of skillchain known as Liquefaction.
13424 : Furthermore, adding a Combo after the liquefaction effect will produce a more advanced Fusion skillchain.
13425 : In the taxonomy of skillchains, each type is related to one or more specific elements. Liquefaction is bound to the element of fire, for example, and fusion to both fire and light.
13426 : Another crucial point, which I simply cannot emphasize enough, is the importance of timing in the execution of skillchains.
13427 : One must not be too overzealous, but too much patience can also be damning. It is most ideal to time the latter weapon skill to begin just a second or two after the preceding one is complete.
13428 : The possible weapon skill sequences and the different skillchains they yield are highly variegated. It is said of this time-tested battle art that it takes a moment to learn, and a lifetime to master.
13429 : Magic bursts are another type of supernatural phenomena which occur after carefully selected and impeccably timed spells are cast following a skillchain. Such spells exceed their typical counterparts in that they are enhanced in both power and accuracy. You will commonly see magic bursts abbreviated as MB.
13430 : Magic bursts will not take place if the element of the spell being cast does not match the element of the skillchain preceding it.
13431 : To take an example, a detonation skillchain, which has wind as its element, followed by an aero or other like spell, will generate a magic burst.
13432 : In the same vein, thunder, or any cognate spell, would result in a magic burst should it follow an impaction skillchain, itself deriving power from that very element.
13433 : As I said previously, some skillchains are associated with more than one element. Take fragmentation, for example. It is composed of equal parts wind and thunder. So chasing a fragmentation skillchain with any type of aero or thunder spell would create a magic burst.
13434 : The key to mastering magic bursts lies in learning the elemental attributes of both the skillchains you create as well as the magic you wield. The rest is simply a matter of timing.
13435 : For your convenience, I will go over the elemental attributes of all skillchain types. Pay close attention.
13436 : Level 1 Skillchain (Associated element): Transfixion (Light), Liquefaction (Fire), Detonation (Wind), Impaction (Thunder), Induration (Ice), Reverberation (Water), Scission (Earth), Compression (Darkness).
13437 : Level 2 Skillchain (Associated elements): Fusion (Light/Fire), Fragmentation (Wind/Thunder), Distortion (Ice/Water), Gravitation (Earth/Darkness).
13438 : Level 3 Skillchain (Associated elements): Light (Light/Fire/Wind/Thunder), Darkness (Ice/Water/Earth/Darkness).
13439 : Kupo ho ho! The Starlight Celebration is once again upon us!
13440 : We moogles have spent many a sleepless night preparing for this year's festivities, kupo. Be sure not to miss any of the exceptionally exciting events that are being held in and about town during this most joyous of seasons.
13441 : Oh, and there's one thing you simply must know, kupo. Should you come by any gift tokens, bring them to me and I'll furnish you with gorgeous gifts in exchange!
13442 : Now, run along and immerse yourself in the revelry, kupo!
13443 : Ah, you've brought %! Here, this is for you!
13444 : Wow! That's quite a few gift tokens you have there, kupo!
13445 : If you're interested, I can exchange all the tokens you have for a grand gift of galactic proportion, kupo! Well, perhaps that's exaggerating things a tad.
13446 : Of course, it's perfectly permissible to use them one at time. The decision is entirely yours, kupo!
13447 : How many tokens will you exchange? The whole kaboodle! I'm a miser. Just the one, please.
13448 : That's the spirit, kupo! Here's a super-duper special gift for the [man/woman] who dared!
13449 : Sure thing, kupo. Here, this is your % in exchange.
13450 : Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight! As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for everyone, kupo.
13451 : For this year's Starlight Celebration, we moogles have set ourselves a challenge: breaking the all-Vana'diel present-distribution record! But we couldn't possibly dream of succeeding at such an ambitious undertaking just by ourselves, kupo.
13452 : We could really do with some adventurer-offered assistance. Would you be interested in lending a hand in this noble endeavor, in the spirit of giving, kupo?
13453 : Help the moogles? Sign me up! I'm a little busy, sorry.
13454 : We understand... But we'll be waiting right here if it turns out you can spare some time after all, kupo!
13455 : You've made this little moogle very happy, kupo! Now then, let's not waste any time. We'd like you to deliver these presents here.
13456 : Report back to us after you've completed your task, kupo.
13457 : Also, we don't mind you working in a group if you feel lonesome doing the deliveries on your own. Just form a party and have everyone come talk to us.
13458 : And I have to warn you, presents can't be taken to other areas, kupo. Be careful, okay?
13459 : Happy delivering, kupo!
13460 : Wow, you've delivered every single present! Thank you so much, kupo!
13461 : Here's a little something for your kindness.
13462 : You want to help us again? That's very kind of you, but we need more time to put together a new set of presents, kupo. Would you mind coming back tomorrow?
13463 : Kupo ho ho! Merry Starlight! As with past celebrations, we've prepared a veritable mountain of presents for all adventurers, kupo.
13464 : We'd appreciate your help in distributing the presents. What say you?
13465 : Help the moogles? But of course! I help no one but myself.
13466 : You're truly a role model for all adventurers, kupo! Now then, we'd like you to take this card and give it to a [male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer.
13467 : If you happen to forget who the card's recipient is, just show it to me, kupo.
13468 : Let' see... This addressee of this card is a [male Hume/female Hume/male Elvaan/female Elvaan/male Tarutaru/female Tarutaru/Mithra/Galka] adventurer, kupo.
13469 : Are you trying to pull a fast one, kupo!? This card isn't yours to give, nor is it addressed to you, so please take it back to where you found it.
13470 : Ah, you've brought us a card! Here's a present in exchange for it, kupo.
13471 : We'd also appreciate your help in distributing cards, kupo. All you're required to do is deliver this card to the addressee. We're counting on you!
13472 : Things have settled down for the time being. But we may have need for your help later on, so don't wander too far away, kupo.
13473 : Capacity-challenged adventurers, come one, come all, kupo! The Mog House Management Union (MHMU) has developed the supreme solution for your storage woes!
13474 : Ah, another adventurer has arrived to take advantage of world-renowned moogle altruism and artisanship! Rest assured that you will not depart disappointed, my friend.
13475 : Feast your eyes on the stylish, fashionable Mog Sack!
13476 : Why, it's the perfect union of form and function! Who could ask for more, kupo?
13477 : What's more, its carrying capacity can be customized to meet its owner's needs. Greedaloxes and Grand Greedaloxes haven't seen anything like this!
13478 : And it can be yours--yes, yours!--for the low, low price of only # gil! Why, that's # gil off the moogle manufacturer's suggested retail price.
13479 : That's right, we at the MHMU don't care how far into debt we go this time! Why, I personally would starve to death in the streets of San d'Oria to free adventurers the world over from inventory frustration! So how about it, kupo?
13480 : Kupo? (Current gil: #) Buy a mog sack. (# gil) Expand your mog sack. About mog sacks. About expansion. Do nothing.
13481 : I'm sorry, kupo. Our special-order mog sacks are limited to one per adventurer.
13482 : Transaction complete, kupo! Say goodbye to days of rummaging through your gobbiebag, and hello to a life of haute hupoture, because you are now the proud owner of a spectacular, snazzy, state-of-the-art mog sack!
13483 : We go through such pains for you adventurers, and you would try to procure our products without sufficient funds, kupo? Will you not be content until every last moogle is in the poorhouse!? <Sniff>...<sob>...
13484 : Oh dear! I almost forgot the most important part, kupo!
13485 : Looking to expand your mog sack? You've come to the right place, kupo!
13486 : A little dose of moogle magic, and...voila, kupo! Your mog sack can now hold an incredible [/35/40/45/50/55/60/65/70/75/80] items!
13487 : You hear the disconcerting sound of fabric being stretched to its limits...
13488 : There you go, kupo! And with that, it looks like I've enlarged your mog sack as far as it will go.
13489 : A ripping sound? I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about, kupo. My, oh my, that's one stupendous mog sack you've got there!
13490 : I'm afraid your mog sack has already been enlarged to its limits. We wouldn't want to have any...fabric malfunctions, would we, kupo?
13491 : I'm afraid your mog sack has reached its limits. Your gobbiebag, on the other hand, looks like it could still be tailored up in the right hands.
13492 : The mog sack is a marvel of modern moogle craftsmanship, imbued with moogle magic that allows its capacity to be increased proportional to the size of your gobbiebag!
13493 : How does that work, you ask? Let's just call it a moogle and Gobbie mystery! Kupohohoho!
13494 : Ah, yes. And for being such a valued customer, here's a special present from the MHMU to you! Truly, our benevolence knows no bounds, kupo!
13495 : Sack storage space: # Gobbiebag storage space: expanded to [30/35/40/45/50/55/60/65/70/75/80] .

13497 : Hail, soldier. I am a purveyor tasked with furnishing the brave men and women of the Voidwatch with essential supplies. My wares can be yours, provided you've got [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes] to trade. After all, we can't afford to let our limited resources go to waste in the hands of some unproven rookie.
13498 : Procure supplies? ([Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Not now. % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#). % (#).

13500 : This % will cost you # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13501 : It seems you're short on [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing credits/Allied Notes], soldier. Come back when you've got a bit more seasoning under your belt.
13502 : Proceed? (Required [Points/Standing/Notes]: #) Yes. No.
13503 : % obtains % in exchange for # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].

13506 : This % will cost you # [Conquest Points/credits of Imperial Standing/Allied Notes].
13507 : You already have %, and I'm not authorized to furnish you with another. Resources are in short supply. You'll have to make do with what you've already got.
13516 : How many? ( [Conquest Points/Imperial Standing/Allied Notes]: #)
13517 : You may purchase up to # at a time.
13518 : Welcome to the MHMU's porter service, kupo! Which of your burdensome belongings shall I take off your hands today?
13519 : Do something, kupo? Porter service? Buy a storage slip. No, thank you.
13520 : Is your gobbiebag splitting at the seams? Mog Safe spilling over? Why, an accomplished adventurer like yourself surely has more stuff than you know what to do with.
13521 : That's where I come in, kupo. I'll gladly hold onto your prized possessions, freeing you space to gather up even grander goodies.
13522 : To make use of my services, first you'll need to buy one of these storage slips for the low, low fee of # gil.
13523 : Storage slips come in numerous varieties, kupo, each corresponding to a different type of item.
13524 : You'll want to peruse the fine print closely, so you don't end up paying good gil for a scrap of parchment useless for the particular item you wish to store.
13525 : Not that we moogles would object to that sort of donation, kupo.
13526 : Choose the item you wish to entrust, then trade it to me along with a single storage slip. I will take the item and return the slip to you, marked with an invisible seal.
13527 : Invisible to you, at least. It's plain as day to us moogles, so don't even think of trying to pull one over on us, kupo.
13528 : When it comes time to retrieve your item, just trade to me a single storage slip--any slip--once again.
13529 : I will present you with a list of all the items currently in my care, and you may choose the one you wish to withdraw. Simple as that, kupo!
13530 : What's more, no additional transaction fees will be incurred! Pretty generous of us for a change, no?
13531 : Now I bet you're wondering what the catch is, kupo. So as not to disappoint you, there are a few!
13532 : For one, any signed items will lose their signatures if you store them with me.
13533 : Why, you say? Hey, even we moogles aren't perfect! It's better for both of us if you keep your most precious possessions close at hand, kupo.
13534 : Now listen up, because there's another catch, and it's a doozy.
13535 : If you lose your storage slip, I won't be able to return your item. Ever. No ifs, ands, or buts! No I'm sorry, Mister Porter Moogle, it'll never happen again! Rules are rules, kupo, and someone has to keep them.
13536 : Last, but not least, I can't accept equipment bearing Magian trial insignia.
13537 : If you have such an item that you're simply dying to entrust to me, you'll have to abandon your trial first, kupo.
13538 : And that's all there is to it. This humble moogle can hardly wait to serve you!
13539 : Buy something? (p. #/#). Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Next page. Cancel.
13540 : % will cost you # gil. Do we have a deal, kupo?
13541 : Deal, kupo? (Current gil: #). Check storable items. Deal. No deal.
13542 : The % will allow you to store the following items:

13554 : %, yes? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
13555 : # [variety/varieties] of item, is it? Very well! Your precious property is safe with me, kupo!
13556 : Is that a Magian insignia I see on that %? You'll have to abandon your trial before I can take it off your hands, kupo.
13557 : That % appears to be augmented. I'm sorry, but I can't accept such specialized gear, kupo.
13558 : Curious as to whether I can accept that item? Let me check my annals.
13559 : Why, yes I can! % can be stored with %.
13560 : Why, it looks as if you have % located in your [inventory/Mog Safe/Mog Safe 2/Mog House storage/Mog Locker/Mog Satchel/Mog Sack/Mog Case/Mog Wardrobe/Mog Wardrobe 2/Mog Wardrobe 3/Mog Wardrobe 4/Mog Wardrobe 5/Mog Wardrobe 6/Mog Wardrobe 7/Mog Wardrobe 8/Recycle Bin]!

13570 : Merry Starlight, and welcome to the job guessing-wessing booth!
13571 : Look at those mighty warm mittens! How'd you like to try something super-duper difficult?
13572 : What's your pleasure? Hear an explanation of the game. [Play/Play the simple version]. [/Play the advanced version.] I lost my synthesis materials. Not interested in playing, thank you.
13573 : Your task, if you choose to acceptaru it, is to guess what the jobs of a group of Tarutaru are.
13574 : There will be more jobs to guess in the advanced version. Can't have things being too easy-weasy!
13575 : If you guess correctaru, you'll score a critical-witical hit (CH). If you're wrong, but there's another Tarutaru with that job, you'll score a hitaru. Each time I'll tell you the total number.
13576 : If you correctly guess all five jobs, you win! If you can't completaru the game within ten tries, you lose!
13577 : All the thrilly-wills you can comprehend for the small fee of # gil per play! What do you say?
13578 : Test your skills? (You currently have # gil.) You bet! I'm not so sure...
13579 : Greataru choice!
13580 : Well...all right. But just because I likey-wike your face. I'll part with this % for # gil.
13581 : Would you like to purchase this material? Yes. No.
13582 : Select which Tarutaru's job? (attempt ##) Tarutaru 1: [Not set/WAR/MNK/WHM/BLM/RDM/THF/PLD/DRK/BST/BRD/RNG]. Tarutaru 2: [Not set/WAR/MNK/WHM/BLM/RDM/THF/PLD/DRK/BST/BRD/RNG].

13591 : What an eagle-weagle eye you've got there! As they say, to the victaru go the spoils!
13592 : Way to fightaru through adversity and come out on top! In honor of your momentous accomplishment, here's a spectacular-wacular prize!
13593 : I mustaru warn you, though, that alone won't amount to much. You'll need to combiney-wine it with the prizes from the other nations if you want to reap all the benefitarus it has to offer.
13594 : Oho, wait a second-wecond--your collection is completaru?! Now it's time to reapy-weap what you've sown and synthesize them!
13595 : Lucky for you I'm feeling generous today. If you like music, you'll simply-wimply love this. After you synthesize your prizey-wise, sit back in your Mog House and get ready to lose yourself in the soothing notarus of reverie.
13596 : Tough luck! You've exceeded the ten try limitaru. Consider-wider giving it another go!
13597 : I suppose this jobby-wob was too tough for you, but don't hesitate to try again!
13598 : A fair day to you, kind [sir/madam]! I am [Niscoliette/Prycillia/Chabobo], assistant to Atelloune. I suppose that makes me assistant to the assistant of his eminence, the great Professor Clavauert!
13599 : We have made a fascinating discovery--chocobos, just like humans, are capable of falling in love!
13600 : And you, my friend, come at the most fortuitous of times. How would you like to help me, erm...spur on the emotions of lovelorn chocobos?
13601 : Too hoo hoo, came to lend your aid once more? (More data for my thesis...splendid!)
13602 : Up for some chocobo matchmaking? I'm always up for a new experience! It'll only breed contempt.
13603 : Splendiferous! And just so we're clear, this is all for the benefit of the chocobos. I wouldn't even THINK of using you for my own research gains!
13604 : Is that so? I guess winning battles of the flesh doesn't mean you can win battles of the heart. Amateur.
13605 : If you change your mind, you know where to find me. (<Sigh> I'll have to actually do my own research for once.)
13606 : So, what's the first way into someone's heart? Presents! First, you'll need to search for and dig up a tantalizing gift!
13607 : You've only got # tries. Remember, the more gifts you give to chocobos, the more easily they swoon. Such simple creatures.
13608 : Select a [row/column]. (Attempt No. #) No. 1. No. 2. No. 3. No. 4. No. 5. Reselect row. Abandon this endeavor.
13609 : Truly let it wither on the vine? Love. Bah. No! We must cultivate!
13610 : How callous! All I wanted was to bring in dat...I mean bring darling chocobos together as soul mates!
13611 : Kweeeeeeeeeeeeh! (Wowow!)
13612 : Kw--Kweeeh!
13613 : The chocobo has unearthed %!
13614 : %! Way to show me how it's done! [/What a wonderful gift!/This'll make the best present ever!]
13615 : ...
13616 : You didn't find anything.
13617 : Why, it's like the locations of these presents change depending on the day! Hmm? Why do I know these things? Silly, I'm a scholar!
13618 : It's gotta be related to the day of the week. Call it women's intuition!
13619 : Oh, come on! Cupid's arrows are supposed to strike true, not go tumbling to the ground!
13620 : The chocobo whimpers in despair.
13621 : Maybe he'll perk up a bit later? Why don't you give it another go then?
13622 : You know what I do when I'm depressed? Eat some sweets. Maybe this poor fella just needs to eat something to cheer him up.
13623 : Now that we've got a present, it's time for step two!
13624 : Well, well, just what have you brought me? Oh, yes, this will do nicely. Our chocobo friend will be back up and kweh-ing in no time!
13625 : The chocobo has a special twinkle in his eye.
13626 : Next up: sweet nothings! Can't win the affections of the fairer sex without a silver tongue!
13627 : Though they may not be able to comprehend your words, the language of love is universal!
13628 : You've got a total of # chances. Think of it like speed dating! The glibber your jibe, the more they swoon!
13629 : The chocobo is completely smitten!
13630 : Absolutely perfect! You're no stranger to love, that's for sure!
13631 : What's this? No sweet nothings? Yes, yes, I know that true love needs no words, but when a romance is still budding, you've got to give it your all! Or...would you rather call it quits?
13632 : Most wondrous! Now that report of mine will be...<cough> Excuse me. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Quick, out with the magical phrase!
13633 : The chocobo blinks and cocks his head to one side.
13634 : Hmm... Maybe if you didn't beat around the bush? Try telling it like it is.
13635 : Maybe these baby chocobos can provide some kind of hint?
13636 : Now that you've found just the right words, it's time to take things to the next level!
13637 : According to my volumes of data, it seems [you two have a chilly relationship, but don't give up yet!/you're on the cusp of winning its heart./you two are on fire! You might as well get hitched!]
13638 : Speed! Luck! Come on, [hon/sweetie], love isn't a battlefield, it's a race!
13639 : Which route to pursue? Route 1. [(Taken by rival.)//] Route 2. [/(Taken by rival.)/] Route 3. [//(Taken by rival.)] Cast your fate to Lady Luck! Give up...at this late stage.
13640 : Route # has already been selected by your rival.
13641 : Let's get this party started!
13642 : Aw, you poor thing, looks like you chose the wrong path to love.
13643 : W-wow! What a turn of events! Love knows no bounds, as the saying goes! Just wait until the profess... I mean, uh, good going!
13644 : After all that hard work you did with your lovely present and those three magic words... Maybe love is all about luck and timing after all.
13645 : Well done! My little cupid has veritable wings sprouting from [his/her] back! The more love, the more data...dates! Dates they will go on!
13646 : With all you've done for me...err, the chocobos, it's only fair that I give you a little something in return. A token of my appreciation, if you will. Of course, you're welcome to come back any time!
13647 : STEP2_DEBUG%.
13648 : Oi, Gottah! I reckon it be time to get our arses in geary-wear and what have you.
13649 : Whateverrr...
13650 : What now, matey? Whatever? Why so unenthusiastic? I'm hearin' that somewhere people're lookin' for some plank-bravin' pioneers.
13651 : Would you fancy thataru! Pioneers in these here modern times! I can feel the ol' adventurer spirit just pourin'-wourin' up inside o' me! Picture it!
13652 : Unknown lands!
13653 : Ancientaru ruins!
13654 : Phantasmical natives!
13655 : C'mon, Gottah, don't that just beaty-weat all?
13656 : Pioneerrring might be fun, but come back to reality for a minute. How long are you going to ignore that adventurer over there?
13657 : Huh?
13658 : Wh-when did you sauntaru over here!?
13659 : You want to know more about this whole pioneerin' giggy-wig?
13660 : To be honest, we don't know a right bit about it either. Stuff about crossin' the ocean and headin' westaru, doin' somethin'-or-other for whosy-whatsit.
13661 : Adoulin.
13662 : Yeah, that be it! Adoulin has started a tremendous pioneer mission and is in need of'n extra pair of hands or two. Lookin' for mighty fine adventarus like yourself.
13663 : Where can I apply?
13664 : The Jeuno Chamberrr of Commerce and Industry.
13665 : Gottah, you're right knowledgeable about this. Who exactly did you talky-walk to to receive such information? An' what else ye got stowin' away in that head o' yers?
13666 : They're holding some kind o' test. Adoulin wildlands are evidently like nothing you've ever seen, so they need to make sure adventurerrrs can handle it.
13667 : A testaru...to prove they can handle it...
13668 : That means our only job be to put adventurers on the right courrrse, matey. We ain't fit enough to fight.
13669 : Gottah, you wanker! That's why I be tellin' you we gotta keep trainin'!

13693 : Travelers may not possess more than # at a given time. Should someone trade an amount of crystals that would result in a surplus of kinetic units, those units will be lost to the aether.
13694 : You have expended # kinetic unit[/s] and will be transported to another locale.
13695 : Your stock of kinetic units is insufficient.
13696 : You have reached your limit of kinetic units and cannot charge your artifact any further.

13704 : You will be asked to confirm your choice of destination. Returning to normal teleportation mode.
13705 : Warp to your destination? Yes. No.
13706 : What memory will you have recalled? None. Seekers of Adoulin.

13714 : Could it be...? It is! Hi, %!
13715 : Do you remember me? [Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime]? Of course you do!
13716 : Thanks again for what goo did for us slimes a couple moons back.
13717 : Why are we here again? Well, you see, Horro wanted to come back for more sweets <slurp>, so...
13718 : Wait! I promise we didn't stow away for a second time! We asked him to let us come back on the Astoltia Ark, and he said yes!
13719 : But, boy, we're in a bit of a pickle once more, and I'd be grateful if you could lend me a <slurp> hand.
13720 : P-promise you won't? Oh, thank goodness <slurp>.
13721 : My name's [Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime]. I really need somegoo's help, but I don't know where to turn.
13722 : We came here on this big ship called the Astoltia Ark together with our friend, Horro.
13723 : It isn't the first time we've been here, though. Last time <slurp> we kind of...stowed away and found ourselves in this world.
13724 : We tried to behave, but ended up causing a lot of trouble for Horro and the great adventurgoos of Vana'diel.
13725 : This time, we made sure to get permission, but things didn't go like we wanted...
13726 : You see, some of our other friends--she-slimes and metal slimes--overheard our plan, and this time they stowed away instead!
13727 : So when we arrived in Vana'diel, they went bouncing off to goo-knows-where!
13728 : And if that wasn't bad enough, some of us more common slimes went off too!
13729 : If I don't bring my friends back, Horro will <slurp> leave them behind!
13730 : So you can guess what's next--I need your help.
13731 : If you give me a hand I'll... Do a little jiggle for you!
13732 : If you do really well, I'll even give you a little <slurp> something special! So, will you help?
13733 : Help find his friends? Of course! I love jiggling! No, thanks. Too much work.
13734 : Aww...[/ Maybe a little jiggle isn't enough...]
13735 : If you change your mind, I'll be right here waiting!
13736 : Why, you're the [man/woman] from before, aren't you?
13737 : Have you come to <slurp> help collect my friends?
13738 : Yay! Thank you so much!
13739 : Finding them is really easy! First, you have to go outside town and have [Slabble/Slime Tarou/Sline] cast a gootastic spell on you.
13740 : The stowaways're probably scared here in this strange land, so they might get angry or <slurp> try to run away.
13741 : Just give them a little thump on the head, and it'll turn 'em into slime coins.
13742 : I'll make sure to thank you propergoo for helping find them!
13743 : Oh, but there's one thing. The spells will make you just as weak as we are, so don't jump in without thinking!
13744 : And I forgot something else! The she-slimes and metal slimes are a bit tougher <slurp>.
13745 : The metal slimes in particular are really slippery. They could run right in front of you, and if you blinked, you'd never notice!
13746 : But they'll give you more coins--and slurpier prizes--if you happen to goo 'em!
13747 : I hope that's a good explanation. If you're ready and raring to go, I can send you to [Slabble/Slime Tarou/Slarin] right away.
13748 : Be whisked outside town? On feathered wings! I'd prefer to stay here.
13749 : Okay! Happy searching!
13750 : I'll send you whenever you want, so just let me know!
13751 : How wonderful is it to be <sneeze> back in Vana'diel. Let's see what [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] has to offer me this time!
13752 : Thank goodness I have this Ranpi-Monpi's Vana'dielian Three-Star Cuisine guide to show me just where to go!
13753 : Let me see... # slime coins? Not bad! Is there anything I can do for you?
13754 : Any requests? (# coins) I want to check available items. I want to be warped outside town. Nothing in particular.
13755 : Check which item? (Total: # coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) %. (# coin[/s]) %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) ??? %. (# coin[/s]) %. (# coin[/s]) [Next page/Previous page]. Back.
13756 : Hee hee! That one's a secret!
13757 : I can give you % for <slurp> # [coin/coins]. [Regooably, you don't have enough./Goo you want this item?/]
13758 : I can sell you between 1 and #. How many do you desire?
13759 : <Slurp> you don't have enough coins for that many! You can only purchase up to # total.
13760 : Ready for the exchange? (# coin[/s]) Ready, Freddy! Hang on, Helga.
13761 : <Quiver>... <Shake> <Shake>...
13762 : Why yes, % are quite a treat, indeed! Next, off to <cough> get me some %.
13763 : Or maybe I should get a couple % instead...
13764 : Ooooooh, but my guide recommends <wheeze> some ever-so-divine %!
13765 : Hohoho, with so much to choose from, how can I possibly get my hands on everything? Better get started!
13766 : Vana'diel is always abuzz, but I can't shake this feeling that <hack> there's something going on outside of town...
13767 : But dear me! If I don't hurry, the stores might close!
13768 : Or they might even run out of stock before I get there! Then there'll have been no point in coming!
13769 : Goo... Since Horro hasn't finished his shopping, we still have some time left before the ark departs.
13770 : So, please, <slurp> gather the rest of my friends before it's too late!
13771 : Oh my, how lovely! Ranpi-Monpi was right about these %!
13772 : O-oh no! Horro's done shopping!
13773 : I've got to tell him what happened so he'll stay a while longer.
13774 : Little one, [Slarin/Sludge/Ultra Slime] told me what happened.
13775 : I-I'm <slurp> sorry...
13776 : And if it isn't my young friend! I <sneeze> had a feeling I'd be seeing you again.
13777 : I'm sorry for all the trouble my compatriots from Astoltia caused for you yet again.
13778 : I'm sorry for all the trouble my compatriots from Astoltia caused for you.
13779 : Here's a little something as a <cough> token of my appreciation.
13780 : Yet somehow, I feel there are more slimes out there.
13781 : But don't worry. <Wheeze> I've still got business in [Bastok/Windurst/San d'Oria].
13782 : The ark will return here to [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst] before we leave, so I'll make sure the slimes are all gathered up by then.
13783 : Oh, Horro! You're so wonderful!
13784 : Now, listen to me. I know Vana'diel is a fun place, and you want to explore <cough> all it has to offer, but you must be more careful!
13785 : My friend, I hope our paths cross once more.
13786 : But until that fateful day, I <sniffle> bid you farewell!
13787 : And now, off to [Bastok/Windurst/San d'Oria] to try some %! Mmm, but what about a few %...?
13788 : I'm glad that Horro was so understanding <slurp>!
13789 : And thank goo for finding my friends!
13790 : I'm sure I'll be able to goother the rest of them before we leave.
13791 : But if you want to see another one of my fine performances, just <slurp> stop by again!
13792 : Oh! Oh! Horro gave me something special for you! He must be really goorateful!
13793 : Oh no, you don't. I can't say squat until you enable that orrriginal objective in the Objective List under the Records of Eminence section of the Quests menu.
13794 : Congrrratulations! Oh, if only I were as lucky as you.
13795 : Here goes nothing. <Hffffff> You're the eleven thousand, one hundred eleventh person to ever visit this square! To honor this crrrowning achievement, we're prepared to offer you a hefty reward.
13796 : How will you respond? How hefty? None of this poppycock for me. Don't. Just walk away.
13797 : Hey, wait up! It's not like I go around saying this to everyone who comes my way. You're trrruly the eleven thousand, one hundred eleventh visitor!
13798 : Poppycock? I'll tell you what's poppycock--thrrrowing away your chance to receive a breath-stopping prize for being the eleven thousand, one hundred eleventh visitor!
13799 : Ah, frrresh meat! Stay a while and listen!
13800 : They say that currriosity killed the cat, but I can assure you that's not the case here!
13801 : Now, to peel back the veritable curtain on your commemorative prrrize...
13802 : Ta-daaa, it's %! Aren't you in rrrapture now?
13803 : This is no ordinary, run-of-the-mill doll, I'll have you know! It's imbued with sorcery and engrrraves your Records of Eminence exploits upon itself. Now that's a handy-dandy tool if I've ever heard of one!
13804 : Anything to say? I've always wanted one of those! Records of Eminence...?
13805 : Exactly! You can never go wrrrong with them, I say. But wait... There's more!
13806 : What? You rrreally haven't heard? I thought everyone had heard.
13807 : It may come as a surprrrise to you, but you're already participating in Records of Eminence!
13808 : Yes, indeed. By talking to me, you've cleared your first objective. That means you eventually get another prrresent: sparks of eminence, which act as quantifiers of your grandeur!
13809 : Anyway, now that you know the rrropes, it's time to try it out yourself.
13810 : Just sink your fangs into any of the short quests in the Objective List under the Records of Eminence part of the Quests menu.
13811 : Easier than scooping fish from a bowl, rrright?
13812 : Certain objectives can be rrrepeated too, so there'll be more to try than there are cats in a clowder.
13813 : Once you accrrrue enough sparks from completing objectives, come talk to me for a saucer of good stuff.
13814 : Uh-oh. I don't know how you managed to sneak this past me, but you're as weak as a kitten. Quit pussyfooting around and talk to Selele. She'll help you brrrush up on the basics...for free.
13815 : Speaking of good stuff, your % is top-notch, so I'm going to need # gil for it.
13816 : ...Not convinced it's worth the price?
13817 : Okay, then. Watch this.
13818 : With a simple clap of the hands, it disappears like magic! That's the power of arcane blah-ditty-blah at its finest!
13819 : So, yeah, there's no way I could entrrrust something so amazing to you for free. Pay up.
13820 : Pay # gil? I've only got catcalls for you. Go cat around somewhere else. I feel like a bag of cats, so no.
13821 : ...Fine, then.
13822 : Huh? Why am I giving up so easily?
13823 : Because the doll's already rrregistered to you. If you're not going to give me money, there's nothing I can do about it.
13824 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Rolandienne in Southern San d'Oria (G-10).
13825 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Isakoth in Bastok Markets (E-11).
13826 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Fhelm Jobeizat in Windurst Woods (J-10).
13827 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Eternal Flame in Western Adoulin (H-11).
13828 : Perhaps it would behoove you to speak with Nantoto in Lower Jeuno (H-8).
13829 : Invisible eyes upon you cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise.
13830 : The % nods in agreement.
13831 : new Records of Eminence objective is now available!
13832 : new Records of Eminence objective, %, is now available!
13833 : You wish to exchange your sparks?
13834 : Wait but a moment. Here, follow this command--er, compendium to the letter and you should be able to learn a thing or two.
13835 : Ah, this almost slipped my mind. Should you receive any distinct sorts of artifacts for completing an objective, I will be happy to take them off your hands.
13836 : Worry not, for I am not out to rob you of your glory. Quite the opposite, in fact. I will provide you with a worthwhile reward for collecting them.
13837 : Thanks to your donation, I now have # % in safekeeping.
13838 : Ohohoho... Turning in sparks, I see.
13839 : Hold your hoarder hares, [hero/heroine]. I love your enthusiasm, but you're not going to learn a thing without a primer. Ahhh, here it is. Have a look-see.
13840 : Oh, crud, that's right. You should trade me any special artifacts you get from completing objectives.
13841 : Why? What a good question! Because I'll give you a nifty-difty reward at some point, that's why.
13842 : Thanks for doing what I asked. Now I have a total of # % from you.
13843 : You want to trrrade in sparks, do you?
13844 : Let me wake up from my catnap first... Alright, now rrread this.
13845 : Wait, wait, wait! If you happen to get any purrrticularly interesting items from completing objectives, send them my way.
13846 : Don't worry, I'm as honest as a cat when the meat's out of reach. I thought of taking them all for myself...
13847 : ...but I don't want to make fur fly with the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, so I'll do my job like a good little kitty.
13848 : Grrreat! Now I have # % from you. Thanks!
13849 : Hm? Oh, spark exchange... Of course.
13850 : I'm not completely sure, but this might help set some things straight...I guess.
13851 : Let me add one thing. Please find it within your heart of hearts to give me anything of particular interest you get from completing objectives.
13852 : I'll make it worth your while...I swear! Just keep at it and I'll be sure to surprise you with a hot, steaming helping of gratitude one day.
13853 : Thanks for doing your part in the battle for love and peace! With this latest addition, I'm now keeping track of # % for you.
13854 : Records of Eminence is a system brought to you by the caring folks at the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network. Set your own objectives whenever you desire, and fulfill them to receive compensation.
13855 : To set these tasks, select 'Objective List' from the Quests menu, then choose ones that suit your fancy.
13856 : You will be rewarded with gil and sparks of eminence, which serve the same function as points, notes, credits, and other such methods of quantifying one's greatness. As an extra incentive, adventurers will earn three times the amount of sparks for completing an objective the first time.
13857 : Completed objectives will vanish from your quest list unless they are repeatable. In the event that you wish to make room for different objectives, you will need to remove them manually.
13858 : As a corollary regarding rewards, you'll be blessed with special remuneration once you complete several objectives. Bask in the joy of these pleasant surprises when you can.
13859 : Lastly, any and all acts of vandalism directed against your % are strictly prohibited.
13860 : Should you be found in violation of this dictum, the heavens will part and wrath incarnate will descend to mete out justice upon you.

13883 : Just trade me any piece of equipment you desire. I will quickly assess its value and award you with an appropriate number of reclamation marks.
13884 : Once you accumulate # of these marks, they will be automatically converted to one % and added to the total number held.
13885 : Though I am only authorized to accept a limited selection of equipment at present, the A.M.A.N. is considering making further additions to this list, so please check back regularly.
13886 : Would you like # reclamation mark[/s] in exchange for one %? You currently have # mark[/s].
13887 : Proceed with the exchange? Yes. No.
13888 : The reclaimer awards you with # reclamation mark[/s] for a total of #.

13890 : You are unable to trade that item at present.
13891 : You are unable to trade that item because you cannot store any more %.
13892 : Only those participating in Records of Eminence may trade in items.
13893 : You can't shake the feeling that you may be able to learn about Ygnas's whereabouts somewhere in this area.

13944 : Attempt Trust magic with her? Of course. No way.
13945 : I have no time to play cat and mouse. If you've got nothing better to do, then scrrram.
13946 : Hmm...the question is, am I willing to try this out with you? The whole idea makes my whiskerrrs twitch.
13947 : Do you rrrealize how much pleading I had to do to get this scroll? The Jeuno Institute of Magical Studies is likely sick to death of my purring!
13948 : And they complained the whole time! The more Nanaa Mihgos, the more troubles the world will face, they said. Bah!
13949 : I'll have you know, everything I've done has been purrrfectly justified...under my own code of conduct.
13950 : That's why I'm pondering whether to try this with you. If it fails, my clawing and scrrratching will have been for nothing.
13951 : I hate it when my efforrrts don't bear fruit.
13952 : You want me to think thoughts of trust, frrriendship, and sisterly love? <Sigh>
13953 : I rrremember the first time you came to Windurst, and we had that chance meeting that set everything in motion.
13954 : [I remember now. When/Furthermore, when] I found that sharp stone, you were an idiot and sold it to that damned visitorrr from Bastok.
13955 : [I remember now. We split that trrreasure trove belonging to Atarefaunet's Band./Not only that, who could forget that we split that trrreasure trove belonging to Atarefaunet's Band?]
13956 : To this day, I can still only rrremember bits and pieces of what happened.
13957 : [I'm absolutely sure you still recall/And I'm absolutely sure you still recall] that time. You know, with the people.
13958 : What was their name again? Oh, right. The Star Onion Brigade. Why you chose to side with a bunch of little miscrrreants rather than the big fish in the pond remains a mystery. I should have your hide for spoiling my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
13959 : While we're talking about frrriendship, I hear you possess a certain likeness of me.
13960 : [How disgusting!/What a purrrvert!]
13961 : Hahaha. I can't fault your taste, though. You picked verrry well.
13962 : [Remember/But there's more. Remember] that time you nearly shrrredded me to pieces?
13963 : Tussling with those Goblins was a fun rrride, to be sure...but sometimes my legs still hurt!
13964 : Urk. I've got no other choice but to try out this scrrroll...
13965 : You'll stand therrre until I give in, won't you? Let's get on with it, then.
13966 : Close your eyes...and think only pleasant thoughts of me.
13967 : Wow, this Trrrust thing actually worked! I thought it was some kind of sick joke. Now, for my fee. 100,000 gil will do nicely, don't you agrrree?
13968 : Ahahaha! Gotcha!
13969 : Those robed nincompoops at the institute exprrressly forbid me from accepting any money for my troubles. Next time, though, it'll cost you! <Sigh> Why did I push so hard to try this, anyway?
13970 : Why, hullo there! %? Ah, you must be talking about that new magic-wagic!
13971 : My big brother is participataruing in the initiative, too!
13972 : But I think he might be too busy-wusy to see you right now...
13973 : Windurst is a peaceful nation, but my brother is looking for the true meaning of peace. At least-weast, that's what he said.
13974 : You know what would be wonderful? [If you helped Vana'diel find peace, for the sake of your own nation-wation./If you helped my brother-wother for the good of Windurst.]
13975 : I'm afraid-waid...he cannot help you right now.
13976 : I never would have expectarued my alter ego to be so--
13977 : Dear brother! I was so worried, with how you ran-wan off like that!
13978 : What else could I do? Doctor Shantotto brought down her wrath on my alter ego!
13979 : But you're so amazing-wazing! I never would have pictured the two of you would be so close!
13980 : Close? Have you completaruly lost your mind? She wasn't the one who undertook the bonding...
13981 : Oh? You're interestarued in Trust, then?
13982 : I see your permit is in order. Maybe you and I can get to the bottom-wottom of this whole debacle.
13983 : Are you sure the bonds between us are strong-wong enough to see this through?
13984 : What say you? I'm feeling confident. Well, now that you mention it...
13985 : Frankly, I'm not convinced either. But if it was so successful-wessful with that last person, then who knows...?
13986 : Pretty sure of yourself, I see. I suspectaru this might work after all.
13987 : I've known you ever since you were just a nobody-wobody.
13988 : I showed you around when you first visited Windurstaru, remember? How long has it been...?
13989 : [Let me see.../What else was there...] That's right. The mage-wages in the Orastery certainly owe you one...or more than one.
13990 : Just how many of their problem-woblems did you solve? Of course, most of them were caused by Doctor Shantotto herself.
13991 : [Let me see.../That wasn't all, was it?] I remember meeting someone who was the spitaruing image of you many, many years ago.
13992 : Yes, that's it! It was this huge, scary-wary Yagudo, come to eat me alive! Oh, come on--it was a joke!
13993 : [Letaru me see.../But the story-wory doesn't end there.] You came to Karaha-Baruha's abode with the % in tow. Don't you even think of forgetting what I did for you back there!
13994 : Everyone should do one good thingy-wing a year, and that fulfilled my quota. Hopefully you appreciated it!
13995 : [Let me see.../Haha, I remember another interesting time!] Those wargames at the Stellar Fulcrum. You sure pulled out some move-woves!
13996 : Tell me your skills haven't atrophied since then...or are you even bettaru than before?
13997 : You reminded me of the true strength-wength that adventurers can have.
13998 : Of course, I haven't forgotten-wotten...
13999 : You put your very life-wife on the line to bring the blessings of the moon and stars back to Windurst.
14000 : Which reminds me--how much about the completaru summoning did you learn at the Animastery?
14001 : Remember, it was not any arcane power that made the difference, it was the power of life itself.
14002 : And now, we are here talking about Trustaru.
14003 : Perhaps this power--which fuses life with yet more life--will provide a hintaru or two for Karaha-Baruha's research.
14004 : Hahaha, do you think I've gotten myself caught up in his legacy-wegacy?
14005 : ...
14006 : Brother, I think there are some sparky-warks of friendship between you and %.
14007 : Huh?
14008 : I saw the smile-wile on your face. You were enjoying yourself!
14009 : E-enjoying? Don't make me laugh!
14010 : Ugh. I can't believe I got roped-woped into this. Fine. Let's get this over with--and if it fails, you can go home crying.
14011 : Why!? Why did it work!? This magic is completaruly maddening!
14012 : Thank you for believing in him! And make sure to come visitaru again soon!
14013 : [Mister/Miss] Adventurer! [Mister/Miss] Adventurer! A quicky-wick word, if you please?
14014 : I'm the lovely Wetata, dispatched straight from the Jeuno Institutaru of Magical Studies!
14015 : Have you heard of Jeuno? It's a city far to the northwestaru that connects Mindartia and Quon.
14016 : My magnificentaru powers of observation tell me that you are [a fledgling/an accomplished/a world-famous] adventurer! Am I right?
14017 : Have I got some lovely-wovely news for you, then! At a recent international meeting, my institute released information on a brand-new type of magic that we've developed!
14018 : [I see you've already heard-weard, but let me review the details./Let me filly-will you in on the details.]
14019 : It's a kind of super summoning-wummoning magic that knocks the socks off even the most tight-laced Manustery mage!
14020 : One of my fabulous superiors--not as fabulous-wabulous as me, of course--has directed me to make this magic available to explorers of all shapes and sizes.
14021 : So I'd like to experimentaru on you...
14022 : Err...
14023 : With you! Experimentaru with you! Oh dear, that didn't come out right, either. But I know you're just itching to give it a shot, aren't you?
14024 : Experiment with the new magic? Why not? Sorry. Not my thing.
14025 : Oh deary-wear. I didn't think it was possible, but I may have screwed that one up.
14026 : I love your positive energy! This will be absolutaruly delightful!
14027 : Windurstians have always been receptive to new ideas and ways of doing things. That's why I'm so excitarued to put my many talents to use here!
14028 : I guess the institute has some of my colleagues posted in San d'Oria and Bastok looking for subjectarus, too, but their small victories will surely pale in comparison to my series of conquestarus!
14029 : Oh no, I've done it again...
14030 : My charming smile may have lured you in, but the endless possibilities of participating here in Windurst surely have you rivetarued! What do you say?
14031 : Who would adventure-wenture alone when you can enlist the aid of a powerful white mage?
14032 : Participate in Windurst? Yes. No.
14033 : Ugh! Who would want to make the trekky-wek all the way to Bastok or San d'Oria when they've got an adorable little figure right in front of them? I think it's in your best interest to reconsider.
14034 : Excellentaru! I knew I could turn that frown upside down!
14035 : See this pristine-wistine piece of paper? Take it with you and head for Heavens Tower.
14036 : Not only am I irresistible, but I'm also good with directions-wections! Just head north from here to Windurst Walls, look for the big tree, and follow the path there!
14037 : You're looking for a foul-mouthed Tarutaru named Kupipi. She might have a bit of a hot streak, but she'll be able to provide you with an explanation-wation almost as stupendous as my own!
14038 : Phew! Is it just me, or is it stuffy out here? Hmm? You want to learn more about Trustaru?
14039 : Inquire about what? What Trust is. What happens when one uses Trust. How to learn new Trust spells. Whereabouts of Trust participants. Nothing at the moment.
14040 : Trust is a new type of magic inventarued by the Jeuno Institute for Magical Studies and unveiled at our recent international symposium.
14041 : As any Aurastery student could tell you, most magic taps into the aetheric energies of the caster, draining them. Trust, however, relies on the spiritual energy which develops between two souls bound closely by love and friendship.
14042 : That means you can use it regardless of your job-wob! Isn't that almost as fantastic as my hairstyle?
14043 : There's one small caveataru--you should never use this magic within city walls. Regulations and all.
14044 : Using Trust magic brings out an alter ego of someone who you have a special-wecial relationship with.
14045 : However, no matter how powerful-wowerful your friends are, when you call forth their alter ego, it will only be as strong as you.
14046 : You must surely be fascinated with all this, thanks to my clear-cut explanation. You want to know what's even more fascinating? That the alter ego will fightaru alongside you!
14047 : Of course, you won't be able to give the alter ego you summon specific instructions-wuctions. This is your friend we're talking about; you don't go barking orders at friends, right?
14048 : So if the alter ego you summon runs off and gets into trouble, don't get too mad, okay?
14049 : To send alter egos back from whence they came, simply tell them so. They'll probably be happy to take a little break-weak.
14050 : If its life force runs out, it will retreataru into the aether and vanish from this realm. But fear not--you'll be able to call it back into our world after a certain amount of time has passed.
14051 : Trust magic is based in the emotions of trustaru, friendship, and [brotherly/sisterly] love, so you can't summon just anyone. Take me, for example--I'm far too adorable and busy for you to call forth whenever you want.
14052 : But there are others willing to help you. Those participating in the Trust initiative may be able to help you if you take the time to chataru with them.
14053 : The strength of the bonds you have with them--if any--determine if the magic-wagic will succeed or fail.
14054 : If it fails, then you may need to adventure more and make a name for yourself, as I have. Or maybe you need to help solve some problem-woblem they have. It depends!
14055 : [And let me fill you in on a little secretaru/Let me fill you in on a little secretaru]. <Whisper> There may be a way to summon an alter ego if you've never even met the person!
14056 : Ahem! You may come across a strange scroll that will let you do this. Bring it to me and I shall use my expert knowledge to assist you in this endeavor-weavor.
14057 : I shall allow you to take but a sip-wip from my vast well of knowledge. Let's see...
14058 : [Excenmille/Naji/Kupipi/Curilla/Ayame/Nanaa Mihgo/Trion/Volker/Ajido-Marujido/Iron Eater/Prishe/Ulmia/Shikaree Z/Cherukiki/Gadalar/Zazarg/Nashmeira/Gessho/Ingrid/Maat/Arciela/Chacharoon] can be found-wound in [San d'Oria/Bastok/Windurst/Jeuno/Tavnazia/Aht Urhgan/Adoulin/the Mog Gardens].
14059 : My fountain-wountain has...run dry!? That can't be right. Maybe I need to wait for another shower of information.
14060 : Oooh, you found-wound %! Why, you're almost as good at this as I am!
14061 : Did you know that the person mentioned here is also a participant in the Trustaru initiative?
14062 : All the stuffiest scholars in the institutaru have burned the midnight oil poring over the towering volumes of data our participants have gathered.
14063 : Ah, the Trustaru initiative has progressed by leaps and bounds over the past several months!
14064 : You and that person must have something truly special-wecial going on between you.
14065 : F-forgive me for looking a bit flushed. It's just that breakthroughs like these don't come-wome every day!
14066 : Oooh, would you look at... ...Waitaru a second. Just who is that?
14067 : The flow of information coming from the headquarters has slowed to a trickle lately. How am I supposed to use this % in conditions like these!?
14068 : Wh-what!? How on Vana'diel did you get your hands-wands on this %?
14069 : This puts me in a bit of a pickle-wickle, but if it's a real cipher, then we've got to try it.
14070 : Wh-what have you done to this cipher-wipher? It's mystically stuck together!
14071 : Still, I'd hold on to it. Maybe we can figure-wigure something out later.
14072 : ou cannot read this cipher due to an event occurring in Rhapsodies of Vana'diel.
14073 : Huh? Just who on Vana'diel is this supposed to be? Well, here goes-woes...
14074 : A strange illusion, you say?
14075 : That's the funny thing about magic-wagic. You never know what you're going to get.
14076 : You may be shocked-wocked to learn that our experimentation with Trust has expanded beyond the five races!
14077 : Speed it along? Grrr... Normally I hate being rush-wushed, but I suppose you're entitled to your due.
14078 : I'll skip the long explanation for now. Close your eyes, and pictaru yourself crawling under the warm, comforting blanketaru of friendship...
14079 : Spectacular!
14080 : I had my doubtarus, but you really did it! I certainly taught you well, didn't I?
14081 : You already know about Trustaru? You mean...one of my colleagues in another nation told you?
14082 : I doubt their explanations were as thorough as mine would have been, but no matter. Will you be participataruing here in Windurst?
14083 : Ah, you found-wound %! Why, very impressive indeed!
14084 : You see, Doctaru Monberaux's services are in high demand, meaning he is unable to leave Jeuno. So he said he wants his alter ego to travel-wavel and see the world.
14085 : However, during our little talk, I feltaru an icy and jealous stare upon me. I wonder who that was...
14086 : Could it have been Wolf... Well, I suppose it doesn't really matter-watter.
14087 : Enough about that. Close your eyes, and pictaru yourself crawling under the warm, comforting blanketaru of friendship...
14088 : Spectacular!
14089 : I had my doubtarus, but you really did it! Best of luck on your future adventures!
14090 : I see, my child. You have hearrrd of this new Trust Initiative.
14091 : If it's a scrrroll you seek, then I bid you talk to [Shikaree Z/Mhag].
14092 : Yet I warn you--should the ritual trrruly require strong bonds, then you would be wasting your time--and hers.
14093 : Her prrresent location? That is not something I am privy to.
14094 : Regardless of her true name, I still refer to her as Shikaree Z out of respect and a sense of grrratitude.
14095 : She [was/is] a sin hunter through and through. As a bearer of the fang, she [submits/submitted] herrrself wholly to the laws of nature.
14096 : Those same laws now guide you, giving you the answerrr to one of the many questions burning in your mind.
14097 : Have you come to confess your sins?
14098 : Well, would you look who it is! Tell me, how've you been treating yourself?
14099 : I told you where I was going before I left, didn't I?
14100 : Upon returning to the motherland, I confessed everything to the queen.
14101 : I've never been good with words, so I spoke from the heart, telling her exactly what transpired.
14102 : When faced with the Emptiness, I fought, proving what true justice is.
14103 : I stopped being a sin hunter, but continued mentoring my younger sisters...and have traveled throughout Vana'diel.
14104 : But there is one thing that piqued my interest...
14105 : I see you have %.
14106 : I[/, too,] have come to speak with Perih Vashai about that very matter.
14107 : [Mildaurion/Our friends in Jeuno] said to me, [I/We] need your help to [fight the Keeper of the Apocalypse/deal with Bahamut, lord of the dragons/deal with the Emptiness].
14108 : I am not blind. [My skills as a sin hunter are/My prowess is] needed by many.
14109 : But who can ensure that my alter ego will not be a sin in and of itself?
14110 : The motherland's leaders are in constant debate about what this new magic can mean for our people.
14111 : Does it abide by the natural order of things?
14112 : If the alter ego causes a sin, then who is the hunter supposed to track down?
14113 : Of course, the queen's stance on these issues is as fickle as a newborn babe.
14114 : But the prevailing opinion is that Trust magic is permissible so long as it does not violate the natural order and is undertaken by one who is not apt to cause sin.
14115 : As such, I received a scroll, and am tasked with finding someone from among [us/the] sin hunters to engage in the ritual.
14116 : Who could possibly be more trustworthy than Perih Vashai? I am here today to give the scroll to her.
14117 : The reason the scroll found its way to me is because I managed to convince Shikaree Y that Perih Vashai would be more worthy than anyone else.
14118 : She knows how to respect the laws of nature, and is as unlikely a person to sin as anyone I know.
14119 : Yet for some reason, she refused.
14120 : The natural way of things is not for us to decide. The sky and land have that responsibility.
14121 : So she elected to wait until she received a sign from above.
14122 : Hmm?
14123 : What is this smell...?
14124 : It smells of change, carried by the western wind. Is something about to...?
14125 : Could it be...? No, not this time.
14126 : Something magical is in the air.
14127 : Memories of my past have come wafting on the breeze.
14128 : It smells of wyverns. It smells of Boneyard Gully.
14129 : No, I do not--cannot--forget where we first fought, and where I first fell.
14130 : You went from being a passerby on my life's road to something much greater.
14131 : My sisters set the wheel in motion, but it was I who issued the challenge--and you accepted.
14132 : You spurred them on to learn the intricacies of the delta attack.
14133 : And there are other scents, too--I picture an open expanse of saltwater with each breath I take. It reminds me of Bibiki Bay.
14134 : Our fights and struggles were noble. We aimed to protect all we held dear: trust, justice, courage, and hope.
14135 : Are these not the qualities required by the Trust ritual? If they are, then we shall surely be successful.
14136 : [There is yet another./And there are other scents, too.] The fragrance peculiar to Mhaura's port.
14137 : My journeys with you taught me about the unspoken rules of the land, and I learned of the place my mother's words were meant to guide me to.
14138 : If my alter ego can help you, then it is not for me to question whether or not the process itself is a sin.
14139 : And yet there's more.
14140 : I can taste the fear that I felt when I confessed my true desires to my sisters.
14141 : I was afraid when I opened up to them because they might not accept what I had to say.
14142 : ...But I know they have changed since they first met you.
14143 : There is also the trace of my sisters carried upon the wind. I have never thanked you for aiding them in their endeavors.
14144 : Thank you for helping Shikaree X with her first survey in Tavnazia.
14145 : Shikaree X told me the reason she was able to speak like a true sin hunter was that you stood by her side.
14146 : Shikaree Y mentioned that you hurried after her when she took a tuning fork in hand and made for Uleguerand Range.
14147 : You know how lightly she always dresses. I would have been worried, too.
14148 : The pristine scents from the sky now tell me of another, beautiful time.
14149 : The sweet sensation of victory when we vanquished the Keeper of the Apocalypse.
14150 : Ahhh, what I wouldn't give for us to gather again, exchanging tales over some %.
14151 : %, can you not hear the voice of nature?
14152 : ...I can hear it speaking to me. It bids me accompany you once more.
14153 : I pledge to follow you to the last, and to guard you with all my strength.
14154 : May your journeys always be filled with excitement.
14155 : Don'tcha think dat furrowed brow and cocked head o' yers escaped me. Yer int'rested in dis chest, ain'tcha? Well, ya gots good right tah be, 'cause even us Gobbies is fascimanated wit' it. It's some sorta myst'ry box salvaged from a shipwreck in da Gugru Blue! Da mysterious part is dat what goes in don't necessarilies come out!
14156 : While I may tout its amazin'ness, don'tcha think fer even a second dat I's at liberty tah divulge hows we came by it. Still, I likes yer face. It's a kind face, one dat says ya won't stabs me in da back, which is more'n I can say fer my own mum. Lemme shows ya how to use dis myst'ry box.
14157 : Bah-dah-bah-dahm dah-daaahm!  Ya open da chest. Dat's it. And da kicker be dat I'm da one doin' da openin'. Ya just gets tah stand dere gawkin' in astonishmament. Easy gig, no?
14158 : Oh yeah, 'fore I forget. What good's a chest if ya ain't gots da key? Well, da key to dis chest is da fine art o' waitin'.
14159 : Ya wantsa know da hows n' da whys? Well da bosses had our tinkers tinkerin' on troo' da night and dey foun' dat...
14160 : Well, dey foun' dat we really gots no idea why da loot changes. Anywho, ya's wanna wait 'n wait 'n wait, den keep on waitin' some more. "Good things come tah dose who wait," right? Well, da longer ya wait, da gooder da thing...maybe. Ya just never know wit' a myst'ry box.
14161 : Also, I calls da amount o' time ya's waited yer circa...circama...circamadamian...ugh, yer daily tally. It ain't just da name dat's catchy, though. Da higher yer tally, da gooder yer goods get! Can't get much good--er, simpler dan dat.
14162 : Finally, ya opens da chest. Oooh, I can barely contain m'self thinkin' o' all da riches I--er, ya could have!
14163 : Oh, dat's right! Heyheyhey, got any items ya won't be needin'? If so, fork 'em over 'n yer daily tally'll increase! Mebbe not by much, but dat's better'n nothin', am I right?
14164 : And dere's no better feelin' dan takin' trash and turnin' it into treasure. It's pramactically a new kind o' alchemy! But don't go gung ho 'n overfills da thing 'til its hinges break. Myst'ry boxes don't grow on goobbues, y'know.
14165 : Plus, I'll be here tah stops ya if I sees ya stuffin' whole Gobbiebags worth o' possessions in dere, so don't worry yer oversized noggin' over and over over it. Whats was I sayin' again? Ugh, never mind.
14166 : Sadly, howsever, anodda myst'ry 'bout dis chest is dat it won't takes just any ol' bauble. It has da taste o' a picky peiste--it feasts upon nothin' but da rarest and unique-est o' artifacts.
14167 : Lastly, since we don't knows where da items go once inside, ya ain't gettin' nothin' back datcha put in. Ya reap whatcha sow, and da weather ain't always condusimasive to a good harvest, am I right? My condolemances in advance for any losses ya mights incur from da myst'ry box's fickle nature.
14168 : Dat all make 'nough sense tah ya? Just say da woid when ya wanna use my services. I's more'n happy tah help.
14169 : Hey! I rem'mber seein' yer foice 'round here. Take a looksie. I's taken' it upon myself tah jigger 'round wit' dese all-new myst'ry boxes, found straight from an ol' capsized vessel in the Gugru Blue.
14170 : I's nevah gonna say how we gots our hands on 'em, so dun even ask! But, still, I gots tah say dat dese're somet'in' special! Now try yer hand 'fore I smack ya!
14171 : Just select yer desir'd dial and plug 'way at it. Will ya win somethin' super special? Or will't be da booby proize?
14172 : Dese're some special dials, an' I gots no inklin' what's inside. Ya gots tah open 'em yerself tah find out what treasures lie within!
14173 : Oh ho, I's forgettin' tah explain somethin' to ya. See dese special dials? Dey're super primo, but I still no know wut's gonna be in dere.
14174 : So I's not be takin' no responsibility if somethin' weird 'n wacky comes out. Got it? Ya open it, ya keep it.
14175 : 'N openin' 'em requires some kinda secret technique. Maybe it'll succeed, maybe tha box'll break. 'Sif I know. But ya can only try 'em once a day.
14176 : Oho, ya feelin' lucky 'nough tah takes a stab at da myst'ry box?
14177 : Whatcha gonna do? (# tally) Open the box and profit! Listen to the explanation. Inquire about my daily tally.  Peek at some possibilities. Nothing right now.
14178 : Ya wanna open dat sucker up? Okay, but which dial ya be wantin'?
14179 : Dat's da spirit! So which dial ya be wantin'?
14180 : So, what dial ya gonna pick? (# tally) I got cold feet, so none. Dial 1 (Materials): # tally. Dial 2 (Food): # tally. Dial 3 (Medicine): # tally. Dial 4 (Sundries 1): # tally. Dial 5 (Sundries 2): # tally. Special dial: # tally [/ (already opened)]. Adoulin dial: # tally[/ (already opened)]. Pictlogica dial: # tally[/ (already opened)].    Wanted dial: # tally[/ (already opened)].
14181 : Yer goin' wit' dial #, huh?  Whatchu tryin' ta pull!? Yer daily tally's too low.
14182 : Yer goin' wit' dial #, huh? Lessee what myst'ries await!
14183 : Dis box is full o' myst'ries, Dat span da realm's his'try, So whatcha gonna get from da chest...o'...uh, fortunery?

14191 : Anywise, where'd da myst'ry be if ya's knew da answer 'fore ya opens it?
14192 : Some things is better left unknown. Gotta leave a little room fer romanchismo in da woild, y'know.
14193 : Dere we goes. Da myst'ry box seems tah like yer offerin'...but it wants more. Got anythin' else ya wanna throw away?
14194 : Dere we goes. Oho, looks like it don't wants no more. Guess ya gotta come back tomorrow if ya's wanna keep gettin' rid o' stuff.

14196 : Sorrah, but it won't lemme put dis in. Got anythin' it mights like better?
14197 : Sorrah, but da chest has dat look. Y'know, da one dat says, "I'll kills ya if ya tries tah give me dat." I guess alls ya can do is comes back some odda time.
14198 : Nah, it just won't woik. I's did my best, but yer daily tally just won't go no higher. Ya ain't gonna get no prizes by hoardin' yer points, so stop bein' such a Greedalox and use 'em.
14199 : Gil-lovin' Gobbies, %, ya's hit da jackpot! I's so happy for ya I think I's gettin' da vapors.
14200 : % obtains %!
14201 : Whoawhoawhoa! If ya's got business wit' da box, ya foist gots business wit' me. Whatcha need?

14209 : #<#
14210 : I understand that you are...an adventurer? My name is Pieuje I. d'Oraguille, commander of San d'Oria's famed Temple Knights.
14211 : Is that %'s voice I hear?
14212 : Forgive me, but I am more accustomed to recognizing faces than voices, especially through such a peculiar device.
14213 : I must thank you for your handling of the Altedour incident in Fei'Yin.
14214 : Never once have I forgotten your dedication to protecting all of San d'Oria.
14215 : As you are doubtlessly aware, a short time ago I received a memorandum from the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network detailing Unity Concord and requesting my services as a Unity leader.
14216 : Tell me. Is there any greater way for a prince regent to earn honor for his kingdom than by spearheading a group dedicated to purging evil from the land?
14217 : Many around me were opposed, but that bothered me not. My brother, Trion, serves as a representative of the Trust initiative, and it falls to me to up the ante.
14218 : I cannot lie. That was an important factor in my decision.
14219 : But be not concerned with our internal squabbles. Know only that it pleases me to welcome you to my Unity.
14220 : My name is Ayame, a ranking member of the Mythril Musketeers. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
14221 : Haha...yes, %, of course I remember you. How characteristic of you to have your fingers in everyone's pies.
14222 : Do not think me ungrateful. No, I am always pleased to have your help, but this time things are a bit different.
14223 : Do not think me ungrateful. You strengthened the Mythril Musketeers in ways I never thought possible, and we are closer than ever before.
14224 : Not terribly long ago I was contacted by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network, which asked that I head a Unity.
14225 : At first I was flustered and thought of turning the offer down. Why would they pick me when there are others more qualified?
14226 : But Volker decided it would be the perfect opportunity for me to develop my leadership skills, and told them I would accept...without my knowledge.
14227 : Though unconvinced that I am the best fit, I pledge to dedicate myself wholly to this endeavor.
14228 : People are counting on me. Not only Volker, but those like you who have pledged their support.
14229 : I will not let you down.
14230 : Stand sharp, maggot! I've got no time for people who're gonna slack off!
14231 : ...Wait. That's you, isn't it, %?
14232 : I hear you've decided to join my backbreaking Unity.
14233 : Well!? What've you got to say for yourself!?
14234 : How do you respond? That's right. Nope. Y-yessir!
14235 : Impudent cretin! You say sir when addressing a superior officer!
14236 : Better. Everyone in my Unity is equal--you're all worthless whelps!
14237 : We don't coddle the weak around here. If you want respect, you earn it.
14238 : Until then, you're just a dried-up, shriveled worm!
14239 : So go crawling around in the dirt and pray some crow doesn't sweep down and gobble you up!
14240 : Now get out there!
14241 : Hello, good adventurer. You can call me Apururu.
14242 : Is that...%? Am I rightaru?
14243 : Your good deeds on behalf of Windurstaru have not gone unnoticed.
14244 : I'm so worried about my brother...but if this is one way for me to help-welp him, then so be it.
14245 : Ajido-Marujido has awoken at lastaru, but...no, I'll not let myself cry. I must work for the good of Windurst.
14246 : You brought hope to a Windurst that was on the brink-wink of despair.
14247 : I've been selected to serve as the head of a Unity-wunity, and can I ever say...
14248 : As the head of the Manustery, there can be no greater honor than--
14249 : Aaaaaall right! Now the Cardian workshop can finally turn something resembling a profitaru!
14250 : tHiS iS aBsoLUtElY WonDErFul. NoW wE HaVe MOneY, ALl ThaNkS tO APurURu!
14251 : H-hey! It's not like I'll be making bank-wank!
14252 : Putting that aside--welcome to my Unitaru!
14253 : We can do together-wether what we couldn't individually.
14254 : Phew... So you're my new pupil, eh?
14255 : Phew... So you're my new pu... %?
14256 : The way you shone when the two of us met in combat...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't impressed.
14257 : I've gotta say, you sure knew how to show me the old what-for...it was like staring into the face of a demon!
14258 : I've lived many years on this green Vana'diel, but you're the only one I've ever proffered my hat to.
14259 : ...Let's discuss how all this came to be.
14260 : The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network came up with this Unity idea, and asked me to be one of its founding masters.
14261 : But I'm not the kind to take on disciples, so at first I was more than a bit wary.
14262 : But the old lady, she nagged me, and nagged me, and nagged me until I finally caved in.
14263 : How do you respond? You can always quit, you know. Must have been tough for you. That's quite the wife you've got.
14264 : Ugh... I didn't expect you to come at me with that.
14265 : Tough doesn't begin to describe it! I was hoping to spend my twilight years for myself, but you gotta play the hand you're dealt.
14266 : Please tell me that you weren't in on it!
14267 : Either way, that's not important now. As long as I'm the master of a ragtag group of youngsters, I'm gonna make sure you all get the training you deserve.
14268 : But to do that, I'm gonna need your help.
14269 : And I'll warn you--my regimens have been known to be...strict.
14270 : And I'm sure I don't need to tell you how strict my regimens are!
14271 : What's the password?
14272 : How do you respond? Rose on the heath. Tavnazia.
14273 : Who's this!? ...Ah, this is the Unity communication device. Forget I said anything.
14274 : Aldo of the Tenshodo, at your service.
14275 : Who's this!? ...Ah, this is the Unity communication...wait. You're %, aren't you?
14276 : The way this little thing is buzzing tells me that you're looking to join my Unity.
14277 : My Unity being the key here. Who else did you expect to be the leader?
14278 : I'm sure the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network would make for...excellent customers in the future.
14279 : Serve the Unity well and I promise you'll want for nothing.
14280 : You found hope where once I had lost it. Lion was alive and I'll never forget all you've done.
14281 : All that she had worked and fought for...we owe it to her to live our lives to the fullest.
14282 : Working with others for a common goal is the greatest reward of all.
14283 : And it's people like you who I need to understand that most.
14284 : Well, do we have a new rrrecruit? I'm Jakoh Wahcondalo, chieftainess of Kazham.
14285 : Come to think of it...didn't I teach you the secrets of eviscerrration?
14286 : Hah-hah-hah! Then all the better for my Unity!
14287 : Are you sure...are you sure you're not currrsed by %?
14288 : Can never be too carrreful these days...
14289 : Let's cut to the quick. You've joined my Unity, corrrect?
14290 : Then welcome.
14291 : But a quick word of warrrning.
14292 : I'm in charrrge here, so don't go about being disruptive!
14293 : If you can do that, we'll have no prrroblems. Now get to it!
14294 : H-hello, you've reached Salaheem's Sentinels.
14295 : There's no problem we can't solve, big or small!
14296 : Aha, we have a new visitor? One moment--I'll get the president for you.
14297 : Yes, this is Naja Salaheem.
14298 : Ah, have we an adventurerrr applying today?
14299 : You could not have picked a betterrr place to be.
14300 : Our Unity is completely free of charge, making it the purrrfect place to hang up your sword and meet some new companions.
14301 : We considerrr it our calling to provide an excellent place for those of all strrripes to utilize their talents in a variety of combat scenes.
14302 : Abquhbah! Get your lazy butt over here!
14303 : S-sorry. Yes, [good sir/my lady], this is Abquhbah of Salaheem's Sentinels.
14304 : We have a variety of powerful backers supporting our organization...
14305 : ...So I'm certain you'll find achieving a high Unity ranking to be a breeze.
14306 : And if we do, then there will be a lovely gift of sweets waiting. Yes, some gold pieces of--
14307 : <Sigh>... Oh, heavens, I think this device isn't worrrking properly. Can you hear me now?
14308 : How do you respond? Loud and clear. Where's Abquhbah? Just what did you do?
14309 : Please forrrgive his impudence.
14310 : We're looking forward to having you serrrve in our regiment.
14311 : And we hope you enjoy your looong stay in our rrranks!
14312 : Oho? Is that % I hear?
14313 : %? Gimme that!
14314 : Picturrre that, hearing from [a non-employee/a second class private/a first class private/a superior private/a lance corporal/a corporal/a sergeant/a sergeant major/a chief sergeant/a second lieutenant/a first lieutenant/a captain] such as yourself.
14315 : You've got some gall shirrrking your duties like this!
14316 : But since you've joined my Unity, I'm willing to overlook that little trrransgression.
14317 : Let's paint the rankings rrred with our unstoppable team!
14318 : And that rrrequires you to not sit around like some good-for-nothing! You belong not just to one of my teams, but to two!
14319 : Be thankful you have work and get your butt out there!
14320 : The magic doll you are trying to reach is either suffering from mystical interference or is not attuned to a bearer.
14321 : Please check the settings and try a-again... Mmph...
14322 : Ahaha! Who can ever resist a good joke? It's me, and no other!
14323 : How do you react? Flaviria? Arciela? Who?
14324 : Oho, expertly deduced! I'd expect no less!
14325 : Huh? Arciela? That little waif of a princess? Granted, I'm quite pretty as well...
14326 : Urk...I'd have expected you to go with the joke...
14327 : But let's get down to business.
14328 : I'm Flaviria, maester of Adoulin's Mummers' Coalition.
14329 : I'm Flaviria, of course. I'm sure you've been to the Mummers' Coalition more than once, so my name should be quite familiar.
14330 : The Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network invited me to be a Unity leader...and how could I say no?
14331 : Though truth be told, I wonder why they picked me over one of the other leaders of the twelve orders.
14332 : Now that I think of it, didn't you trounce one of our more enigmatic patrons in a game of Boom or Bust?
14333 : And here I thought that the man in black couldn't be bested.
14334 : I'd better brush up, or you'll be coming for me next!
14335 : Either way, welcome to my Unity! I'm not completely clear on how best to proceed, but let's find the path together.
14336 : Ahem. <Cough-ethy>
14337 : So you're the young mind who's come to join-ethy my Unity?
14338 : Well met, I am Dr. Yoran-Oran, former minister-ethy of the Rhinostery in Windurst, and involved in all manner of magical research.
14339 : Ah, didn't you assist-ethy me with my mandragora research back then? Those items were of great help, thank you.
14340 : Ah, I know that voice-ethy! %, that's you, isn't it?
14341 : Your efforts-ethy saved the Great Star Tree. Windurst owes you a deep debt of gratitude.
14342 : Listen %. Those three monstrosities you so kindly brought into my life have put me in a very disconcerting situation-ethy. I have a lot more to say about it, but for now let's focus-ethy on the issue at hand.
14343 : Things have slowly gone back to normal-ethy now that the wretched trio of chaos incarnate has left. I've finally managed to begin work-ethy on my next book.
14344 : Thank you again for your aid during the Shantotto crisis-ethy. Were it not for you, our entire dimension would have been twisted and defiled beyond recognition. I still get nightmares-ethy thinking about it.
14345 : You see, I have many students who regularly come-ethy to me to learn from my vast well of knowledge, but the students who buy my books are by far the best-ethy.
14346 : One of these students was part of the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network-ethy and invited me to become a Unity leader.
14347 : I hesitated, of course. Wasting my intellectual prowess in the adventuring business-ethy didn't seem fitting for a scholar like myself.
14348 : But then I thought-ethy some more.
14349 : Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?
14350 : With this flawless object in mind, I've decided-ethy to accept the nomination as Unity leader.
14351 : And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.
14352 : You see, I have many students who regularly come-ethy to me to learn from my vast well of knowledge, but the students who buy my books are by far the best-ethy.
14353 : One of these students was part of the Adventurers Mutual Aid Network-ethy and invited me to become a Unity leader.
14354 : I hesitated, of course. Wasting my intellectual prowess in the adventuring business-ethy didn't seem fitting for a scholar like myself.
14355 : But then I thought-ethy some more.
14356 : Could this in fact be the perfect-ethy avenue to promote my glorious research?
14357 : With this flawless object in mind, I've decided-ethy to accept the nomination as Unity leader.
14358 : And as Unity leader, I hope none of you will reproach-ethy me if I happen to plug my new book every now and again-ethy.
14359 : .........
14360 : Oh! Right! I should probably say something. I'm Sylvie. As you can probably guess from these clothes. I'm a geomanger--I mean, geomancer!
14361 : Oh, I forgot...you can't see my clothes, right? Forget I said that, okay?
14362 : Oh, huh? %? Is that %?
14363 : Oh, %, it's you.
14364 : %! It's %!
14365 : How are you getting along with your luopan? Have you gotten used to using Colures, yet? If you keep your head and shoulders to the grindstone I'm sure you'll master it!
14366 : I know Daddy's training can be rough, but it looks like you passed his test with flying pigs...is that how you say that?
14367 : Did you know that Daddy would speak really highly of you? He would always talk about how a promising new geomancer showed up and was looking forward to seeing what you could do... He seemed so happy.
14368 : I can still feel your Communion. If it weren't for you back there, we would have been domed, I mean doomed. Anyway, thank you %.
14369 : It's all thanks to you that we were able to fulfill Zacariah's duty. You're like the most...stupenderrific hero to all us Zacariahs!
14370 : So...I guess this mean you'll be joining my Unity?
14371 : Thank you so much. It means a lot to me.  As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.
14372 : Ikhi said this wasn't a good time for me to be leading a Unity.
14373 : But...I couldn't just stay at home doing nothing. It's easier to forget the sad things when you've got a lot to do, you know?
14374 : So when the offer for Unity leader came, I had to accept.
14375 : You can't stay blue forever. Daddy would probably laugh at me if he saw how down and depressivated I am these days.
14376 : ...Right, smile Sylvie! Let's make this Unity work. With you as part of the team, I'm sure our efforts will bring us bear fruit. Huh...why do they call it bear fruit?
14377 : Wait, so does this mean you'll be joining my Unity?
14378 : As a representative for geomancers everywhere, I want our Unity to be the most geomancerrific. I mean, the best Unity that it can be.
14379 : With you on our team, we'll be truly unstoppableable!
14380 : To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure what to do when the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network first invited me.
14381 : If it weren't for Ikhi's guidance, I'd be down a creek full of paddles.
14382 : She said if the Unity could show people everywhere how to communicate with nature and spread the ways of the geomancer, then it was something worth doing.
14383 : There's still a lot I don't know as a geomancer, but I'm going to triple down and do my best as UL.
14384 : Let's make this the best Unity we can!
14385 : Yeah, go team!
14386 : And...if you happened to be in Western Adoulin...and are also interested in geomancy, come see me by the docks. Wait, but not like...in a weird way, okay?
14387 : It might be in your best interests to speak to [Urbiolaine/Igsli/Teldro-Kesdrodo/Nunaarl Bthtrogg] in % [(G-10)/(E-11)/(J-10)/(H-11)].

14410 : Unity Concord is a system promulgated and managed by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network.
14411 : Participating adventurers are able to receive a variety of benefits and rewards just by engaging in their everyday activities.
14412 : Unity is a catchall term that refers to the group that participants belong to.
14413 : Unity leaders are individuals who have strong ties to adventurers' activities and are sterling representatives of their home nations.
14414 : Members of the same Unity can converse with each other over great distances through the use of specialized figurines known as %.
14415 : Chat settings may be changed by selecting Status from the main menu, and choosing Unity Info under the Unity submenu.
14416 : You may not always be able to join the chat if too many players are participating at once.
14417 : Those belonging to a Unity are able to undertake special Records of Eminence objectives related to Unity Concord activities.
14418 : The three pertinent categories include shared objectives, Unity leader-specific objectives, and Wanted battle objectives.
14419 : Shared objectives may be taken regardless of which Unity you have joined. These tasks can be undertaken at any time, and change every day at midnight (JST).
14420 : Unity leader-specific objectives are tied to the Unity's eponymous leader and change each week.
14421 : Wanted objectives center around vanquishing particularly heinous foes that terrorize Vana'diel.
14422 : These objectives are of a higher caliber, and thus require currency known as Unity accolades to undertake.
14423 : Shared and leader-specific objectives provide more accolades than run-of-the-mill objectives.
14424 : Vana'diel has always been plagued by nefarious foes pillaging the landscape, but relatives of some of the more heinous ones have been spotted lately.
14425 : The A.M.A.N. has deemed it necessary to eliminate these Wanted targets, and has notified Unity members that they are of the utmost priority.
14426 : A list of these foes can be viewed at any time by selecting the appropriate subcategory under the objectives list.
14427 : Unity Concord representatives are able to provide participants with transportation to the areas where these threats can be found.
14428 : Though tackling the profane will likely require participation of your allies, the objective can be undertaken so long as at least one person has set the appropriate objective.
14429 : When you set the objective and commence the battle, the requisite number of Unity accolades will be deducted from your total.
14430 : Successful challengers will be rewarded with special rewards in addition to the normal sparks of eminence.
14431 : No Unity accolades will be charged should you commence the battle without having the appropriate objective set, but the rewards you can reap from your efforts will be limited.
14432 : You can snatch unparalleled equipment and materials from the slain corpses of Wanted targets.
14433 : An A.M.A.N. specialist versed in arcane harmonization has kindly offered to use these materials to bring out the latent potential in such pieces.
14434 : One of the Unity guides will be pleased to accept certain combinations of equipment and materials to begin the process for you.
14435 : A number of accolades is required for this service, but the precision and accuracy of her methods are without equal, and there is no worry of your equipment being destroyed.
14436 : You can use specified materials to add new attributes to equipment that has been upgraded.
14437 : Utilizing additional materials after adding an attribute can accumulate Reinforcement Points for the equipment and increase its rank.
14438 : Increasing your equipment's rank can boost its attributes, while some equipment can also have additional attributes added later.
14439 : Speak to the Unity guides after gathering the necessary materials for your equipment in order to add attributes to it or increase its rank.
14440 : The first time you add an attribute to a piece of equipment will require the use of Unity accolades.
14441 : It also requires that you first complete a specific Records of Eminence objective.
14442 : The work you request will be carried out on-site by a specially trained Unity guide.
14443 : Completing Records of Eminence objectives as part of a Unity will reward you with Unity accolades in addition to sparks of eminence.
14444 : These accolades not only serve as a symbol of prestige, but can also be exchanged for a variety of services.
14445 : Some of these services include purchasing items, securing battle zones for hunting Wanted targets, fees for strengthening equipment, and more.
14446 : Please note that you may only exchange a maximum of # accolades per week (Earth time).
14447 : You may switch Unities once during the Unity ranking tabulation period.
14448 : This is not a decision to be taken lightly, for switching Unities will cause you to forfeit any benefits you were receiving from your previous one.
14449 : This process requires a fair deal of paperwork, and the A.M.A.N. will charge you an accolade fee based on your rank.
14450 : However, your valorous deeds remain wherever you choose to go, and you will not lose any other accolades.
14451 : Rankings are decided through the combined efforts of each of the Unity's members.
14452 : The A.M.A.N. tabulates all the good deeds done during a period of time and confers benefits on a Unity for the following ranking period.
14453 : Some of these benefits include changes to Unity accolades gained and the effects of equipment earned from Wanted battles.
14454 : Yes, you read that correctly--the attributes of certain equipment will increase in line with your Unity's ranking.
14455 : On the other hand, members of a Unity that finds itself on the lower rungs will enjoy an increase in accolades and capacity points earned to help bring them up to par.
14456 : Additionally, an individual's evaluation is the sum of the accolades they have earned divided by #. A Unity's ranking is the average of all eligible members' individual evaluations.
14457 : The A.M.A.N. does not look kindly on those who only seek to siphon rewards from others' hard work, and thus only confers these boons on those who have collected at least a certain number of accolades.
14458 : Unity leaders may also join you as alter egos for a limited period of time.
14459 : Those with evaluations of # or greater will be able to call forth an alter ego of their leader to assist them in battle.
14460 : Those eligible will be able to use the alter ego from the moment they acquire the appropriate ranking level until the tabulation after the next.
14461 : A leader's alter ego grows in power the higher their Unity is ranked.
14462 : Changing Unities will remove the player's ability to call forth their leader's alter ego at the moment they leave their current Unity, regardless of personal evaluation or remaining time.
14463 : A player will have to work hard in their new Unity and acquire a sufficient evaluation to regain the ability to call forth their new Unity's leader.
14464 : It goes without saying that players must first have acquired a Trust permit in order to avail themselves of this opportunity.
14465 : Those desiring to participate should seek out one of the initiative's representatives, dressed in green, in one of the three nations.
14466 : ou are currently under Unity restriction. Please try again during the next tabulation period.
14467 : he A.M.A.N. has removed the Unity restrictions placed on you. Please choose your Unity.
14468 : ou call out for aid from the Unity leaders, but none have heeded your call. Please try again.
14469 : ou have already changed Unities. Please wait until the next tabulation period.
14470 : hould you choose to be teleported to this area, you will not have enough accolades to participate in the Wanted battle. Teleport anyway?
14471 : Teleport anyway? Yes, please. No, thank you.
14472 : Yes, a vision has descended-wended upon me... I can see into the very depths of your heart.
14473 : I sense a great emptiness... Perhaps because you have not completarued at least # Records of Eminence objective[/s].
14474 : Fhelm Jobeizat will lead you on the path to enlightenmentaru.
14475 : Yes...I sense spiritual energy swelling nearby. It's only a mattaru of time before someone who has set % from the Records of Eminence Tutorial submenu will come to me.
14476 : I can feel-weel your aura.
14477 : Yes...a strong aura.
14478 : The wheel of fataru has begun to turn...
14479 : Slowly, softly...but surely.
14480 : I am Teldro-Kesdrodo.
14481 : And I, Yonolala.

14483 : ...And one for all. Your destiny is to participataru in Unity Concord.
14484 : How do you respond? Sure, I'll try it. You guys are creepy.
14485 : N-no! The candle-wandle of fate...

14490 : Yonolala, if you please.
14491 : Of course, Teldro-Kes...drododoro.
14492 : Teldro-Kesdrodo stares Yonolala down.
14493 : Yonolala begins to squirm.
14494 : <Ahem> Bring it to me.
14495 : Here.
14496 : Come. Close your eyes and focus your thoughtarus on this doll.
14497 : You focus your thoughts on the strange doll.
14498 : Yonolala swiftly and secretly inscribes your name on the doll's backside.
14499 : Oh my! Y-Yonolala, look!
14500 : Your name mysterious-weriously appeared on the doll! How could it...!?
14501 : Oh, brave hero, let me proffer to you words regarding Unity Concord directaruly from the mouth of Altana herself!
14502 : Unity Concord is a system most revolutionary initiated-wated by the Adventurers' Mutual Aid Network (A.M.A.N.)...
14503 : ...That incorporates disparate adventurers in groups for a greater-weater cause.
14504 : Yes! I sense your adventures will be even more resplendentaru with Unity members by your side.
14505 : To which Unity will the Goddess guide-wuide you this day?
14506 : Can a fate-wate that was written in stone be eroded so easily?
14507 : No! It can't!

14509 : Until then!

14519 : Surely others like you have been called to action. Why not try communicataruing with them?
14520 : Yonolala, if you please.

14591 : This precious jewel is one of Reisenjima Sanctorium's most mystical treasures.
14592 : Our legends state that it was formed from the energies of a thousand different lives.
14593 : Though it had originally been regarded as but a minor artifact, in the future you and my father had drawn forth its true power.
14594 : In reality, it is a piece of the mothercrystal.
14595 : Please, Master. You may have taken the first steps, but I urge you to continue pressing on.
14596 : Gilgamesh awaits word in Norg.
14597 : Master, behold your orb.
14598 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully reached the third gate.
14599 : But the spirits which protect Reisenjima Sanctorium have gone silent...
14600 : And I am unable to remain here in 884.
14601 : My abject failure to guide you in your hour of need is a shame that I shall not overcome.
14602 : Had I been able to better serve you, then maybe...
14603 : But I can safely place my trust in you. You have come this far, and the orb grows stronger with each passing day. You will be ready when the world has reached the fulcrum.
14604 : May your steps remain swift and true.
14605 : Head for...the palace...
14606 : Master, behold your orb.
14607 : Your path remains steadfast, and you have successfully surpassed the third gate.
14608 : But there remains one whom you have yet to meet. A young woman who plays a vital role in your story.
14609 : I am afraid that you will not be able to see her in the world's current state.
14610 : If only I could return to 884 and walk by your side once more!
14611 : Yet my mind and body are crippled, and I can scarce muster this small advice--!
14612 : Master...forgive me.
14613 : Lead Aht Urhgan out of the darkness and forge the bonds you were destined to.
14614 : I'm so hungry...
14615 : Ovjang...Ovjang, where are you?
14616 : I'm here...[in Aydeewa Subterrane/on a pirate ship]...
14617 : Luzaf...I wish you were here...
14618 : Please...help me...
14619 : Razfahd must be stopped...
14620 : Despite betrayal by those I once called my own...
14621 : I refuse to yield until humanity's blight is purged from this land.
14622 : I now serve to bring darkness unending, an umbral shroud choking the life from Vana'diel.
14623 : Simply opening the Gate of the Gods would bring the Zilart what they have been denied for over ten thousand years.
14624 : The endless nightmare would be endless no longer.
14625 : Have you ever paused to consider exactly whose nightmare it is?
14626 : Those who have ceased to be? Those who walk Vana'diel as she stands today?
14627 : Old gods? New?
14628 : No. It is a nightmare of the crystals themselves.
14629 : We were born in Vana'diel and exist only due to her endless bounty.
14630 : And yet our very presence here is an affront to her. We are the source of her nightmare.
14631 : There is one secret to humanity's success: ambition. Imagining a better future, it strives ever onward in search of it.
14632 : Having seen the promised land, it rages and struggles each day to become more than it was meant to be.
14633 : And it continues to claw its way forward, even if what it aspires to be does not truly exist.
14634 : Its insatiable avarice defines it more than even it can possibly realize.
14635 : But I am not a human such as you. I will be--I must be--an existence far beyond the most grandiose thought of such petty, grasping beings.
14636 : For that is what life is. And those who cannot reach that pinnacle are fated to perish.
14637 : Time is a cruel beast whose savageness cannot be sated.
14638 : Every man, woman, and child feels its claws sinking into their backs, the talons digging ever deeper with each passing day.
14639 : It marches on, unstoppable, immaterial, and unforgiving, and all any of us can do is watch it pass.
14640 : I claimed ever greater power in pursuit of my goals until my time, too, ran out.
14641 : All I wanted to do was protect my countrymen...my homeland...
14642 : An alternate world, with alternate fates and alternate existences.
14643 : I gambled my own life away to protect the world I called home.
14644 : Can you truly say that you [did/would have done] any different?
14645 : I channeled my love for my homeland into power.
14646 : When I fell before you...
14647 : ...did it mean everything was for naught?
14648 : I, and I alone, have seen the true nature of things in this world.
14649 : And thus, I have learned why all beings that rise must fall.
14650 : This is a burden which I must bear and prevent from happening ever again.
14651 : Should you not understand why my goal is pure and just, then you are unworthy of being called human.
14652 : Open your eyes and witness the truth!
14653 : Don't let ignorance cloud your judgment!
14654 : %...
14655 : What you see before you--is it a dream, or something else?
14656 : Is this a dream? What else could it be? No. It's something more...
14657 : Come. Surely your vision cannot be that clouded.
14658 : A keen eye, as always.
14659 : The minds of all who have existed--and all who will exist--are as one.
14660 : As, too, are the light and darkness inherent in the mothercrystals.
14661 : I need not point out that the apparitions appearing before you are those whose schemes you have foiled.
14662 : And those...
14663 : ...Who you are destined to stop.
14664 : I have sought them out of my own volition, hoping to manipulate their essences for my own ends.
14665 : Dark, infernal forces, serving as a counterbalance to the light you hope to make manifest.
14666 : And now is the time for me to fill you with that energy. Come.
14667 : You don't really expect to save the world, do you?
14668 : At best you might buy it a few more phases of the moon.
14669 : Even should I fall, there is a grand legion aching to take my place.
14670 : So in the end, all my journeys have been utterly without meaning.
14671 : One by one, those I have trusted have fallen. None are left to prop me up when I begin to falter.
14672 : Hahaha...none know who I rrreally am.
14673 : False prophets. False worlds. False adventurers... The truth is the pain I feel inside.
14674 : Each combat has prepared me for the next...but in the end, it's all worthless. A new age is descending, and it threatens to leave me behind.
14675 : Pandora's box-wox has been opened, overturned, and shaken until nothing remains inside.
14676 : Perhaps not even your precious-wecious hope.
14677 : Some claim that hope is what keeps humanity sane in these trying times...yet in reality it is a prison that shuts away the real world.
14678 : No matter how deeply darkness has penetrated your soul...
14679 : ...no matter how much you want to give up...
14680 : You must not. You cannot.
14681 : Hope is something seized, not given.
14682 : Whether surrounded by friends or walking a hard road alone...
14683 : There is unshaking value in seeing your path to its conclusion.
14684 : You are the culmination of all your experiences.
14685 : Even those who are gone still depend on you.
14686 : %, this rhapsody is yours to sing.
14690 : Master--the orb.
14691 : You have set history on its proper course yet again, having passed through the fourth gate that stood before you.
14692 : Yet Selh'teus's words ring true--the darkness slumbering within you is great.
14693 : He claims that not even the crystal is enough to illuminate it.
14694 : I must confess my trepidation at the current state of affairs. What if the darkness overcomes you not in the future, but even earlier than I had anticipated?
14695 : What a morbid state of affairs we find ourselves in.
14696 : We must take solace in the hope that the orb will guide you to safety, so that you will be prepared for the Reckoning.
14697 : Until that time, your footsteps must remain unerring.
14698 : And so fate guides you to Ceizak Battlegrounds...
14699 : The future should have changed...
14700 : ...And I should have been dissolved into nothingness.
14701 : Yet the crystal's clarion song has ceased.
14702 : And the Cloud of Darkness threatens the world once more.
14703 : The time of the Harvest Festival is upon us once more, and with it comes a most wondrous event: a costume contest known as the Pink Masquerade!
14704 : Sick of donning those tattered old robes and half-rusted suits of armor? Then why not take this opportunity to dress up in something more festive--and perhaps even earn a prize for your efforts?
14705 : At the very least, the masquerade promises to be a refreshing change from your everyday adventures. What say you?
14706 : Participate in the Pink Masquerade? Sounds like fun! I think I'll pass.
14707 : A shame upon shames, to be sure. But there's still time to change your mind--the masquerade is available throughout the duration of the Harvest Festival!
14708 : Splendid! Let me explain the rules of our little competition.
14709 : All entrants are tasked with putting together the most lavish outfits they can find and strutting their stuff for the judge--namely, me. Points are awarded for the following types of equipment: main weapon, sub weapon, head, body, hands, legs, and feet.
14710 : We're an equal opportunity contest, so don't think you'll be impressing anyone here with your Gjallarhorns or Idrises! Only rewards gleaned from special events are counted.
14711 : Feel free to brandish them if you want, but don't expect me to care in the slightest.
14712 : As this is an event to celebrate the Harvest Festival, entrance fees will not be charged in the form of gil, but rather sweets.
14713 : Those whose outfits receive at least # points will be awarded with a commemorative piece of attire directly from the steering committee.
14714 : But why be content with being mediocre when you can reach for the stars? The top three contestants will have their entries displayed on these mannequins for all to see!
14715 : That's the long and short of it. Speak with me again if you have any further questions or would like to know what types of sweets we accept.
14716 : Until then, prepare your most outlandish costume and come back when you're ready to be judged!
14717 : Take this special garb as your just rewarded for coming up with such a delightful outfit!
14718 : Oh, heavens! Don't tell me you lost your %!
14719 : A distressing tale, indeed. I will furnish you with another one should you provide me with another piece of sweets.
14720 : As promised, here is another reward in exchange for your sweets. Make sure to keep this one safe and in pristine condition!
14721 : The pink masquerade is proving to be the event of the season, and I am both humbled and honored to serve as your guide.
14722 : Do you have any questions? Who are the winning entrants? Tell me about the costume contest. What kind of sweets do you want? Tell me how entrants are judged. I'd like %. None for now.
14723 : The costumes of the three entrants with the highest scores are displayed here for you to see. First place is in the center, second place is on the left, and third place is on the right. It is possible that multiple entrants have received the same score.
14724 : [/First/Second/Third] place: % - # pts.
14725 : No participants have received enough points to have their outfits displayed.
14726 : I will accept any of the following types of sweets as payment for participation in the masquerade.
14727 : Sweets list: (# types. Page # of #) Previous page. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm done. Next page.
14728 : The judgment criteria is a bit nuanced, but I'll offer you the best explanation I can.
14729 : As the sole arbiter of fashion, the chief and chief alone issues garment-related edicts without any concern for race or gender.
14730 : Each accent you add to your costume affects the overall look, and he will determine a numerical value based upon the stuff you strut.
14731 : Yet I must warn you that he has trained hard under Brygid's watchful eye, and recognizes that the trends of the season are as fickle as the westerly winds.
14732 : In other words, just because you have received a particular score for wearing a given outfit, you are not guaranteed the same reception if you come back later donning the same garb.
14733 : And of course, the sweets you give me plays an integral... Ahem! Forget I said anything!
14734 : Another player's outfit is currently being critiqued. Please come back later.
14735 : Well, well, would you look at that stunning little number. Chief! You have a visitor!
14736 : Your score for this outfit is... #!
14737 : [Did your mother dress you in that?/Next time, put your socks on under your shoes!/I've seen worse...but not by much./Maybe if you had offered up some better sweets.../<Yawn> Been there, done that./The chief is wholly unimpressed./What an affront to common sensibility./At least you remembered to brush your teeth./The color scheme was a bit off...] Take your mistakes and learn from them for your next entry!
14738 : Congratulations! You have met the bar for success!
14739 : Here is your splendid gift, as promised!
14740 : I have given you all I have to give, but why not give it another go to see if you can place in the top three?
14741 : Why, this is one of the most splendid outfits we've seen! I am more than pleased to award you [/first/second/third] place!
14742 : Let me put that wonderful costume of yours up for display on one of our mannequins.
14743 : That's all I have for now. See if you can beat your own personal record next time!
14744 : As promised, here is your just reward for doing such a good job in this year's Pink Masquerade.
14745 : Though I've got nothing more to give you, I encourage you to participate again to see if you can beat your score!
14746 : (Shhh...mannequins aren't supposed to talk.)
14747 : (The pain of having to stand here perfectly still is indescribable...)
14748 : (At least I'll be able to line my stomach with sugary goodness once this is over.)
14749 : You must first turn the style lock function off before trading that item.
14750 : #%(Max:#)
14751 : #Woo-hoo factor.
14752 : (#/#/#(Max:#))
14753 : #Results.
14754 : Able adventurer, warmest welcome from the Magian Mooglehood.
14755 : To think you can perceive me in my true form, kupo! The trials of time take a toll on us all.
14756 : I command and control crystal-related incantations. Their ephemeral essence helps hold Vana'diel together.
14757 : Surely you have studied synthesis? Then you are doubtlessly versed in their myriad uses, kupo.
14758 : Promise you will not speak a syllable to others of my existence here.
14759 : Will you stay mum? Mum's the word. I don't think so.
14760 : ...
14761 : I scarce have the stamina to stop you, but I doubt others would believe this tale anyway.
14762 : Still, I shan't assist you if you don't promise.
14763 : Then the deed is done! In exchange, I shall proudly proffer my services in making your crystals ephemeral, too, kupo.
14764 : Ahhh, mayhap I have moved too quickly. Allow me to apprise you of the particulars--of this crystal storage, if you will.
14765 : It's strikingly simple. Trade me your crystals and I shall safely store them for you. You need only glance at your currencies list to see the amount I'm holding for you.
14766 : But I can store more than crystals alone. % and the like are also acceptable.
14767 : My mysterious moogle magic has limits, kupo, so I can only hold up to 5000 of a particular element.
14768 : You never know what secrets are in store unless you try!
14769 : You can wistfully withdraw them at any time by speaking to me.
14770 : Any number over 12 will be returned as clusters, kupo.
14771 : The  gives a sly smile.
14772 : This service is available to you free from the fetters of funding. As long as you keep this hush-hush, I'll always assist you with no recompense required.
14773 : If you can find me here, then you'll surely see me in other locations too, kupo. Moogle magic, you know.
14774 : Of course, I do not actually exist in Vana'diel. Only a part of me projects into your world.
14775 : It's rather similar to summoning magic, kupo.
14776 : I promise not to bore you with the particulars. Just come chat if you need me, kupo.
14777 : You are now able to store crystals!
14778 : Come for crystal-related concerns, hmm?
14779 : What would you like? Crystals returned to me. A bit of an explanation. Nothing for now.
14780 : Which element? Never mind. Fire  # Ice . # Wind . # Earth . # Lightning . # Water . # Light . # Darkness . #
14781 : How many would you like? None, actually. A specific number. As many you can fit.
14782 : How many? (# stored)
14783 : # [/fire/ice/wind/earth/lightning/water/light/darkness] crystal[/s], correct? Then that will mean a total of...
14784 : # %.
14785 : # % and # ).
14786 : Are you sure?
14787 : Is this what you desire? Yes. No.
14788 : As many as you can fit!? I-if you say so...
14789 : Okay... Moogle Magic, ahoy!
14790 : There are limits to what my mysterious moogle magic can make up.
14791 : Inquire about what? Your purpose. Storing crystals. Retrieving crystals. Who are you? Nothing in particular.
14792 : I'm in charge of crystal chants. Crystals, of course, are the very lifeblood of Vana'diel, kupo.
14793 : Surely your sacks are spilling over with them! I can perhaps assist you with your problem.
14794 : You want me to hold onto these, kupo?
14795 : # %.
14796 : # % and # ).
14797 : Calculated in crystals, that comes to a total of # %.
14798 : Then let the magic begin!
14799 : That's all there is to it, kupo! Let me know if you need me again.
14800 : Unfortunately, it's all I can do to hold on to what you've already given me, kupo!
14801 : You have stored # % for a total of #.
14802 : You have stored # % and # ) for a total of #.
14803 : You want me to hold onto these, kupo? Then let the magic begin!
14804 : You have stored # % for a total of #.
14805 : You have stored # % and # ) for a total of #.
14806 : Here we sell items from the various guildmasters and also exchange crafter points for your convenience.
14807 : Sorry, we don't allow amateur craftsmen to take advantage of our services.
14808 : What would you like to do? Purchase a crafting kit. Exchange crafter points. . Special materials. Check the deliverable items. Ask about the delivery process. Never mind.

14811 : You want to purchase %? It will cost # gil for # of them.
14812 : Are you sure about this? Yes, I'm sure. On second thought...
14813 : I'm sorry, we don't currently seem to have the item available in that quantity.
14814 : Which item? (# crafter points) % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). % (# CP). I changed my mind.
14815 : Do you want to purchase the % for # crafter points?
14816 : Do you want to make the trade? Yes. No.
14817 : You don't have enough crafter points.
14818 : These are the items that we are taking deliveries of. Simply select an item whenever you want to check the recipe.
14819 : Deliverable Items %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. I'm finished here.
14820 : This is where you can deliver the crafting sets that the guildmasters have created.
14821 : By delivering items, you can earn crafter points that can be exchanged for special ingredients.
14822 : Crafting sets can be made by using special crystals known as analysis crystals, crystals which that enable you to set the quality level.
14823 : The higher the quality level of the crafting set created, the more crafter points you'll earn, so try to make the highest quality sets you can manage.
14824 : Analysis crystals can be obtained from the person in charge of accepting deliveries in exchange for guild points.
14825 : Analysis crystals cannot be used to create items other than the ones in the crafting sets.
14826 : Please note that you can't use % in place of %.
14827 : The ingredients required to make a crafting set can be checked by referring to the deliverable items list.
14828 : At the present time, you can receive up to a maximum of # guild point[/s].
14829 : Any points beyond that from making deliveries will be lost, so keep that in mind.
14830 : Crafting sets delivered here will be sold as crafting kits until the next day at 10:00 a.m. (Vana'diel time).
14831 : It helps the junior members of the guild, so keep on making those deliveries.
14832 : Thanks for the delivery. Everything looks to be in order.
14833 : You receive # crafter point[/s], and now have a total of # crafter point[/s]!
14834 : We now have available % for the low cost of # gil per.
14835 : I am willing to part with up to #.
14836 : My apologies, but our stock is limited and I cannot sell you any more at this time.
14837 : What do you want to do? Obtain a kit. Check the scheduled quantity. Ship the item. Nothing.
14838 : Which do you want? %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. %. Exit.
14839 : What is the quality? (1-1000)
14840 : %: #
14841 : Oh, hello-wello. What is that shield you are carrying?
14842 : Oh! I see you must have had a meeting-weeting with her already.
14843 : Yes, I have heard all aboutaru it. It is a shield that can increase one's crafting abilities. I was quite surprised when I heard the story.
14844 : If that story is for real-weal, then I definitely would like to see it for myself.
14845 : I know all about your talentaru, and if she chose you too, it must mean you have the qualifications necessary to make the shield.
14846 : Now, allow me to teach you the recipe-wecipe.
14847 : So, with this particular ingredientaru list, you first need to obtain %.
14848 : This item is needed to boostaru the Craftsmanship of the % to its full potential.
14849 : I actually received some notes on the topic-wopic of Craftsmanship. Please bear with me while I go over them.
14850 : You can increase Craftsmanship by crafting items that match up with your skill while you have the % equipped.
14851 : Craftsmanship will increase greatly when you fulfill certain conditions, but crafting the same item over and over again will reduce your gains, so try synthesizing something different if you run into trouble.
14852 : In its default state, the shield has the unfortunate tendency to lower the success rate of your crafting, but as its Craftsmanship rises, it mitigates that effect.
14853 : You can tell the Craftsmanship rating as well as the crafting success rate by looking at the shield. Good luck to you. Mwahaha...
14854 : So, did you find that little tidbitaru of information useful?
14855 : Once the Craftsmanship is high enough, come to me and I will make you the %.
14856 : After that, you'll need % and % nextaru, which you can obtain from Julissois.
14857 : I assume you are no stranger-wranger to making deliveries. That is basically how you will get the ingredients you need.
14858 : You can speak with Julissois for more information.
14859 : That covers the ingredient listaru. Please bring the shield by once you have made the upgrade. I'm curious to see it for myself.
14860 : Hm? You say you forgotaru the recipe already? Wait just a moment and I will get you the list again. Professional craftsmen really need to remember these kinds of things.
14861 : You have worked hard to master your craftaru. I have faith that you can handle this.
14862 : I see... That's the ticketaru. I should be able to use this to make the %.
14863 : This mustaru be the %.
14864 : I am not sure how the whole thing works, but it is amazing to think that I can pour my soul-woul into this shield somehow.
14865 : Oh, it seems that when the % was wroughtaru, it somehow reduced the Craftsmanship of the %.
14866 : That is not a problem if you wantaru to upgrade the %, but if you need to make another %, you would need to increase the Craftsmanship again.
14867 : Of course, you're not the type to lose something so valuable-waluable and need to replace it.
14868 : Impossible. You mean to tell me that you actually lostaru the %?
14869 : Well, I suppose these things happen-wappen. I'll make another %, so please let me borrow your shield.
14870 : You are a professional craftsman. As such, it should not be so difficultaru to take care of your ingredients.
14871 : It appears you made the upgrade without incidentaru. Do you mind if I take a look?
14872 : Oh... I can see that it has changed, and it is giving off a faintaru energy. However, you can tell that it is not complete yet.
14873 : No, you must craft it multiple-wultiple times in order to achieve the level you seek. That is what she told me anyway.
14874 : That reminds me... She asked for some kind of sign after the shield is complete. Please give me a momentaru.
14875 : That should do it.
14876 : Now, take this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and everything will be perfectaru.
14877 : Oh, justaru one more thing. I often have deliveries for Julissois, and would appreciate it if you could help me train the younger members of the guild.
14878 : Welcome. Our mutual friend told me you would be paying me a visitaru.
14879 : You're here to upgrade your shield, right? Firstaru, you'll need to learn the recipe.
14880 : You're awfully quietaru. Did you get that?
14881 : As for the listaru of ingredients, the first thing you'll need is the %.
14882 : You'll need to equip the % while you craftaru until you boost its Craftsmanship to 100%.
14883 : Do you remember equipping the aspis while you were crafting before? This is basically the same conceptaru.
14884 : Once it reaches 100%, bring it to me so I can inspectaru it and make the %.
14885 : Next is the % and the %. You are familiar with the % from before. You can requestaru both of them from Julissois.
14886 : The lastaru thing you'll need is the %. Together with the A.M.A.N., I've prepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.
14887 : You can refer to the Records of Eminence menu for additional information. Once you complete all of them, you will receive a perfectaru %.
14888 : That concludes my explanation on the ingredients. You are a person of great talentaru. I know you'll do an excellent job.
14889 : Oh, it looks like you've given a nice boostaru to the shield's Craftsmanship.
14890 : Now, please waitaru while I make the % for you.
14891 : Okay, here you go.
14892 : Ahh, it's just as I thoughtaru. Making the % caused the shield's Craftsmanship to decrease.
14893 : Therefore, make sure you take good care of the % so you don't have to craftaru it multiple times.
14894 : My my! I'm not usually one to make shields, but even I can tell this one is of high quality! You truly are an expertaru craftsman!
14895 : Indeed, I can sense greataru power coming from it compared to the last one you made.
14896 : Now, before I forgetaru, allow me to mark the shield so you can take it back to her.
14897 : There, all finished. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap and you'll be set.
14898 : This kind of thing happens to all of us. You can have another try at the final objective, so make sure you get it rightaru this time.
14899 : Well, well, look who's chomping at the bitaru. Let's get down to business, then.
14900 : Ah, so you know the recipe already? Then I'll share with you something you might not know.
14901 : It's about how to get % and %.
14902 : You've got to take orders-worders from the guild and bring them to the person who placed them.
14903 : Not only do they have an eye for quality, but they want to see the artisan at work up close.
14904 : For the most part, they'll only acceptaru items that you made right at their side.
14905 : And you will have to procure the materials yourself. I presume this doesn't pose a problem?
14906 : The good news is that some products have been made available at other guilds.
14907 : Among these, of course, are synthesis kitarus.
14908 : Of course, it's anyone's guess as to whether or not they'll be in stock.
14909 : I'll give you % and % once you have filled all the orders.
14910 : Here is the [first/second/last] order.
14911 : Deliver # % to Nouveil in %
14912 : Deliver # % to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in %
14913 : Deliver # % to Yaman-Hachuman in the Orastery in %
14914 : Deliver # % to Nouveil in %
14915 : For those, it doesn't matter whether or not you make it at their side.
14916 : Report back once you have delivered-wivered the items.
14917 : Your current requestaru is...
14918 : How is everything going?
14919 : How is your progress? Fine. I give up.
14920 : Glad-wad to hear it!
14921 : Terrible news indeed! Are you sure there's nothing to be done?
14922 : Really give up? Not yet. Yes.
14923 : That's too bad-wad. I'll just have to get someone else to fill the order.
14924 : Not that I can blame you for wanting a break. Let me know when you change your mind.
14925 : I trust that everything is going well? Let me give you your next assignment.
14926 : I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!
14927 : I've received work that the order was successfully filled-willed. Well done!
14928 : As promised, let me present you wtih % and %.
14929 : If you lose them, I can have them replaced...for a fee.
14930 : You've gotten quite the hang of this, haven'taru you?
14931 : Ah, yes! The shield!
14932 : Well, it looks fabulous indeed, and much lighter than I would have pictured.
14933 : I can barely wait to see what the next stage will bring with it!
14934 : Ah, but perhaps now you have learned the innermost secrets of weaving. Why not give them a go?
14935 : Hello, friend. I see that you are ready-weady to take on the final upgrade.
14936 : Now then, let me explain aboutaru how to obtain the necessary materials.
14937 : The firstaru two things you'll need are % and %.
14938 : I have asked Julissois to hold-wold them for me. You simply need to exchange crafter points for them.
14939 : The other material-waterial you'll require is %. I can produce it for you once your shield's Craftsmanship reaches 100%.
14940 : That's it for my explanation. This being the last step, I thought it'd be a more difficultaru undertaking, but I guess not. Do be careful though.
14941 : I heard that Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno requires the % when it's finished-winished. Please try not to lose it.
14942 : Ahh, welcome. Can I help you with something-womething?
14943 : I see... The item you're looking for was a special requestaru made by a Tarutaru from Adoulin.
14944 : We have a rather difficultaru situation here. I already sent it to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno.
14945 : Therefore, I suppose you should visitaru Jeuno once again and see if it has been delivered.
14946 : Ah, you came at just the rightaru time. I found that item you were looking for stuck in my loom.
14947 : Hm? You need this thing? Yes, it was for you all along, so I don't see any problem-wroblem with you taking it.
14948 : Ahh, welcome. This must be it...
14949 : Yes, the shield is quite amazing. I can tell justaru how much work has gone into its creation.
14950 : The guild emblem that I worked so hard to lovingly-wovingly craft is nicely on display. It turned out even better than I expected.
14951 : Now that you're finished, I would like to teach-weach you this new crafting technique.
14952 : I know that you will be able to use this technique to further hone your craftaru. I look forward to seeing what you can become.
14953 : 0: # 1: # 2: # 3: #
14954 : Oh, it's you again. What's the storrry behind that shield?
14955 : Hmm... I see you've spoken with her. Like me, you're quite currrious about things.
14956 : According to her, that shield can boost one's crafting ability. If it's true, that's quite an incrrredible feat.
14957 : That's the shield, yes? I have the recipe, so I suppose I could do it if I had the time... I'm really busy, you see.
14958 : I know... She gave you the shield, yes? You're quite skilled at our crrraft, so how about you give it a try? Yes, it's settled then!
14959 : Listen up now. I'm going to teach you the rrrecipe, so pay attention.
14960 : So, firrrst, you'll need % to get started.
14961 : Its purrrpose is to boost the Craftsmanship of the % to its full value.
14962 : Wait a moment. I have some notes on Craftsmanship that you should hear, so listen carrrefully.
14963 : Did you catch all of that?
14964 : Come see me when you've incrrreased the Craftsmanship rating. I'll make you the % that you require.
14965 : Next on your list are % and %. You can get them by speaking to Tergil.
14966 : I imagine you've made deliveries for people, yes? This is basically the same idea.
14967 : You can speak to Tergil for furrrther details.
14968 : That's it for the ingredients. Come show me the shield after it's been upgraded. I'm currrious to see it for myself.
14969 : Hm? You forrrgot the recipe already? Okay, here's the list again. Remember, skilled craftsmen only need to hear this once.
14970 : You've managed to match even my skill as a craftsman. I'm prrretty confident that you can make this shield.
14971 : Yes, very well done indeed! With this, I can make the % no prrroblem.
14972 : So, this is the %.
14973 : The technique to imbue a craftsman's soul into the shield to form a crystal... It makes no sense to me, but I can definitely feel its power.
14974 : Hmm... It appears that by creating the %, it also reduced the Craftsmanship of the %.
14975 : That's fine if you only need to upgrade the %, but you'll have to raise the Craftsmanship if you want to make another %.
14976 : Of course, it's not like you'd ever need to do such a thing. Not someone as rrresponsible as you.
14977 : I don't believe it... You'rrre telling me that you lost the %?
14978 : Oh well. These things happen I guess. Let me see the shield. I'll crrraft you another %.
14979 : You're an elite craftsman now. You need to take better care of your ingrrredients or you'll never get any work.
14980 : It seems you made the upgrrrade. Here, let me see how you did.
14981 : Hmm... I can see the differrrence and feel its power, but it's clearly not finished yet.
14982 : I'm sure she's already told you that you'll need to craft multiple times in order to achieve the expected rrresults.
14983 : Oh yes... You need proof that the shield is complete. Wait just a moment and I'll get that rrready for you.
14984 : That should do it.
14985 : Simply show this shield to Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno and you'rrre all set.
14986 : Oh, one more thing. I often have deliveries for Tergil. I hope you'll agrrree to help me train the newer guild members.
14987 : Hello therrre. Yes, I've been expecting you after speaking with you know who.
14988 : This is the recipe you'll need. Do try to rrremember it, will you?
14989 : I hope you didn't forrrget that already.
14990 : Now, let's discuss how to obtain the ingredients. Firrrst, you'll need to start with the %.
14991 : You used this before, no? Like with the aspis, you'll need to crrraft while equipping the % in order to boost the shield's Craftsmanship.
14992 : This time, though, you'll need to put in a little more effort.
14993 : Once you have increased the Craftsmanship to its maximum level, come see me and I'll crrreate the % for you.
14994 : Next, you need % and %. Do you remember the % frrrom before? I've given both of them to Tergil.
14995 : Last is the %. With the help of the A.M.A.N., I've prrrepared some Records of Eminence objectives for you.
14996 : You can rrrefer to the Records of Eminence menu for more details. Once you've cleared them all, you'll get the %.
14997 : That's it. I know it's harrrd work gathering all of these ingredients, but you've been through worse, no? I know you'll be fine!
14998 : Oh, it seems the shield's Craftsmanship has drrropped.
14999 : Wait just a moment. I'll have the % for you beforrre long.
15000 : Ahh, it turned out just perrrfectly.
15001 : Ahh... It looks like crrreating the % has once again caused the shield's Craftsmanship to drop.
15002 : It is no easy task to increase its Craftsmanship, so keep it in a safe place until you're rrready to use it, understood?
15003 : Hah... Something about this shield is quite fascinating. Did you use % or something?
15004 : Yes, I can sense the power of this new shield. It feels rrremarkably different from the previous one.
15005 : Here, allow me to marrrk it for when you show it to her.
15006 : Therrre you go. Take this shield to Mewk Chorosap to complete your task.
15007 : This simply will not do. You'rrre going to need to face the final objective once again.
15008 : You've done well. Now, let's go over the next rrrecipe.
15009 : What's this? You alrrready know the recipe and how to obtain some of the ingredients? Well, this should go quickly then.
15010 : That just leaves the % and %. Very well then.
15011 : We have some customers coming to orrrder items from us, so I'm going to have you make the items near them and make the delivery.
15012 : It seems many of our customers are quite knowledgeable about boneworking, so they want to see our craftsmen's work up close and perrrsonal.
15013 : As such, only items made in front of the customer will be accepted, although there are some exceptions to this rrrule.
15014 : Forrrgive me, but you'll need to gather the necessary materials to create the item yourself. Fortunately, it doesn't matter how you get them.
15015 : By the way, we've reached an agrrreement with the other guilds to buy and sell items that aren't normally available, assuming you have the money.
15016 : You can see the items available in this area by speaking to each guild's crafting set vendor. I suppose it'll prrrove quite useful for you.
15017 : Although, note that each guild is free to set its own rrrules, so you may not always be able to get what you want.
15018 : Once you complete all of the customer requests, I'll give you the % and % as prrromised. Good luck out there.
15019 : This is the [first/next/last] request.
15020 : Make a deliverrry of # % to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in %
15021 : Deliver # % to Crooked Arrow in %. You can find him in frrront of the Auction House.
15022 : Make a deliverrry of # % to Silver Owl at the Tenshodo in %
15023 : Make a deliverrry of # % to Pawkrix at Muckvix's Junk Shop in %.
15024 : Oh, this is an item that doesn't need to be crrrafted near the customer.
15025 : Don't forrrget to report back to me once you finish the request.
15026 : The current request you're worrrking on is...
15027 : How is the request coming along? Everything is going accorrrding to schedule?
15028 : Everything okay? Everything's great! It could be better...
15029 : I know I can always count on you. Keep up the good work!
15030 : Hm? What's the matter?! You don't sound very well at all... Are you surrre you're feeling okay? Do you want to give up?
15031 : Will you see this through? I'll do my best. I've had enough.
15032 : I see... I guess you have been working prrretty hard recently. Very well. I'll ask another craftsman to help me.
15033 : Try not to push yourself too harrrd. Take a rest for now and I'll have another customer for you when you're ready.
15034 : Hello. You look like you're feeling better. Indeed, you're not nearrrly as pale as you were before! Okay, let's get down to business, shall we?
15035 : Ahh, it seems you've finished the deliverrry to our customer. Nice work!
15036 : Yes, I see you've completed the final deliverrry. I knew I could count on you to get it done.
15037 : Alright, here are the % and %, just like I promised.
15038 : While I'm sure you'd never lose something so prrrecious, you can use guild points to obtain them again if need be.
15039 : I really have come to like this kind of work. It's quite rewarding to see your efforts come to frrruition.
15040 : Look! The shield is complete!
15041 : Yes, it really does have a nice feel to it! Your skill as a craftsman continues to grrrow without bounds!
15042 : Accorrrding to her, the next upgrade should unlock the true power of the shield. I can't wait to see what it becomes!
15043 : Oh, I almost forrrgot! I was thinking you could make use of this new crafting technique. Consider it my little gift to you. I hope you can get some use out of it.
15044 : Hello there. I see you've rrreached the final upgrade!
15045 : You will need to ask about the rrrecipe. All I can tell you is how to obtain the necessary materials.
15046 : Let's see... First, you'll rrrequire % and %...
15047 : I've left them with my frrriend Tergil. You just need to exchange crafter points for them.
15048 : Next is the %... I can produce it for you once your shield's Craftsmanship rrreaches 100%. Just like before, basically.
15049 : That about covers the explanation. This being the final upgrade and all, I expected it to be more difficult, but it sounds prrretty much the same. Hopefully, there's nothing to trip you up out there.
15050 : I believe Mewk Chorosap in Jeuno needs this. Be carrreful not to lose it on the way.
15051 : Hello. Hm? What's wrrrong?
15052 : I see... Yes, I rrreceived the order. I was told to put my very heart and soul into it, so I remember it clearly.
15053 : Although, I just sent it off to Jeuno. I never hearrrd that you'd be by to pick it up. If only you'd told me sooner...
15054 : Well, I'm sure it's already arrived by now. You should rrreturn to Jeuno and see if it's been delivered. It was addressed to Mewk Chorosap.
15055 : Hey, you didn't happen to bring this from Jeuno, did you? This emblem that I worrrked so hard to make...
15056 : Hm? You've been searching for this? I wonder how it got here... Perrrhaps it was a ghost? Here, hurry up and get it away from me.
15057 : Wait a moment! This must be it! Let me examine it...
15058 : I see... I see... This is quite impressive! Just when did you manage to learrrn such skill?
15059 : Actually, now that I think about it... You walking around with this thing is the perrrfect way to spread the word about our guild!
15060 : I'm glad you showed me this. Here, I have something for you. It will teach you a brrrand new crafting technique.
15061 : Your growth rrreally is quite impressive. If I'm not careful, you're likely to replace me as guildmaster before I know it!
15062 : You have entered the crafting target area.
15063 : Crafting the requested items in the current target area will count towards the number of items you are required to deliver them.
15064 : You have left the crafting target area.
15065 : # % remaining.
15066 : You're the one that's going to make me the %, rightaru? I just need # more.
15067 : That's greataru! Just what I need! Please bring me # more.
15068 : These're greataru! Just what I need! Please bring me # more.
15069 : Excellentaru, my good friend! You really helped me out here! Thanks again.
15070 : You're the one who knows about the recent goings-on in Heavens Towerrr, right?
15071 : All you had to do was ask for my help, you know.
15072 : Honoi-Gomoi is always quick at rrremitting payment, but I've got a bad feeling about him this time.
15073 : I accepted his task without much thought, but after hearing about the incident at Heavens Tower, I wonderrr if I made a mistake.
15074 : I'd advise you to be carrreful if you plan on stopping him.
15075 : Just before you came, someone from the Tenshodo in Jeuno came looking for someone to assist with a problem the Yagudo were having.
15076 : I figure everyone involved is itching for a fight. But who can say what their trrrue goals are?
15077 : But enough chatter. I've got otherrr things to worry about right now.
15078 : This is an explanation of the Assist Channel feature, which allows new and returning players to seek help from veteran adventurers.
15079 : You must take on the % Records of Eminence objective before receiving the explanation.
15080 : You must complete % before taking on the % Records of Eminence objective.
