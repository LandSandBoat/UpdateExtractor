6605 : Would I be out of place to recommend recuperating? Let us return to town upon the next battle's conclusion.
6606 : Phew, I'm beat. One more battle ought to do it.
6607 : Maybe just one more battle. This time I mean it, honest!
6608 : We should call it day. Let's make the next battle our last.
6609 : Phew! I'm beat! One more battle?
6610 : We've proved ourselves in battle this day. Let us make the next opponent our last.
6611 : One more victory should satisfy me for the day.
6612 : I'm sooo tirrred...
6613 : [/Getting rid of me already?/Are we done already!?/Are we done for the day?/Time to part ways?/Sending me on my way?/Are we done already!?/Time for goodbyes?/What?

6618 : Are we finished already? Awww... Call me again, okay?
6619 : Huh? Party's over? That's a shame... Let's do this again sometime!
6620 : Oh? Do you have engagements elsewhere? As you wish. I shall be prepared for when you next call.
6621 : Sending me on my way? I'll be around if you need me.
6622 : Are we done already!? It's been fun!
6623 : Time for goodbyes? Until next we meet.
6624 : What? You want me to go? Make sure you keep in touch!
6625 : Time to part ways? Very well. Until we meet again.
6626 : I come all the way here, and now you want me to leave? Hmph. Just don't let me catch you slacking off from your drills.
6627 : Alrrright! I'll see you later.
6628 : You are unable to disband with your fellow at this time.
6629 : [/A parting gift!/Ha!/Back to the pit with you!/The tide of battle turns!/Your time is up!/Time for action!/This battle is ours!/Try this on for size!/The tide of battle turns!]
6630 : A parting gift!
6631 : Ha!
6632 : Back to the pit with you!
6633 : The tide of battle turns!

6647 : We can start fighting any time.
6648 : I'm prepared for battle.

6655 : I'm all healed up and ready to go!
6656 : I'm prepared for battle.
6657 : You presume to be my guardian? I suggest you worry about yourself.

6660 : Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch.
6661 : No problem! This is just a scratch!
6662 : Nothing to worry about. Just a scratch.
6663 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.
6664 : I'm fine. No need to worry, okay?
6665 : This? An injury? Psshaw!
6666 : Thank you for asking, but this is no cause for concern.
6667 : This little scratch? Pay it no mind.
6668 : This little scratch? I've had bigger paper cuts!
6669 : Nice of you to worry. But I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
6670 : No problem! This little scratch won't slow me down!
6671 : Don't hold back on my account. This is a mere scratch.

6677 : You might want to keep on eye on my health. Better to be ready for anything.
6678 : Shouldn't we rest a little? I question my ability to survive another battle.
6679 : I'm fine...really.
6680 : I think I still can push on for a while.
6681 : I am not in immediate danger, but prevention is better than cure. And cure is better than raise...
6682 : I'm a little tired. Maybe we should rest a bit.
6683 : I'm still fairly fresh, but maybe we should rest a bit more. Then I'll be ready for anything!
6684 : I'm a little tired. Shall we rest for a bit?
6685 : Can we take a break? I don't think I can handle another fight just yet.

6694 : I need to take a break soon.
6695 : Hey, how about taking five?
6696 : Might I be so bold as to suggest we rest?
6697 : I'm exhausted. Can you give me a minute?
6698 : Phew! I think I've earned a break, don't you?
6699 : I'm exhausted. Can we sit down...for a bit...?
6700 : Phew... I think I need to lie down...

6709 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
6710 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
6711 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
6712 : Enough! Let me rest already!
6713 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
6714 : Please... I need to sit down...

6800 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
6801 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
6802 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.

6828 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6829 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
6830 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
6831 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
6832 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
6833 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
6834 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
6835 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
6836 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
6837 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
6838 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
6839 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
6840 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
6841 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
6842 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6843 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
6844 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
6845 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
6846 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
6847 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
6848 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
6849 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
6850 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
6851 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
6852 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
6853 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
6854 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
6855 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
6856 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6857 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
6858 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
6859 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
6860 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
6861 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
6862 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
6863 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
6864 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
6865 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
6866 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
6867 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
6868 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
6869 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
6870 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6871 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
6872 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
6873 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
6874 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
6875 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
6876 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
6877 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
6878 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
6879 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
6880 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...
6881 : [/Ready?/Keep your eyes open!/I see an opening./Are you ready?/I'm warmed up now./Don't blink now!/Are you ready?/Alrighty!/Are you ready?] [/I'm taking my shot!/You don't wanna miss this!/Get ready to follow up./I'm beginning my attack!/Time for a real attack!/Follow my lead!/I'm taking my shot!/Here goes nothing!/I'm beginning my attack!]

7289 : [How farrre you?/Hello!/May Altana guide you, pioneer./A pleasure to see you./A fair day to you./It is good to see you.] I am here to provide intrepid pioneers with assignments from the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition.
7290 : Here at the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition, we entrust various tasks related to [the colonization effort/the protection of Adoulin/the transport of goods through Adoulin and Ulbuka/the collection of information for the benefit of the coalition/the pursuit of new technologies/the provision of new entertainment forms] to those willing to aid our cause.
7291 : %, is it not? Brenton at the Pioneers' Coalition has been looking for you. Please go see him at your earliest convenience.
7292 : %, correct? Brenton here would like to have a word with you. He said it was important.
7293 : [Welcome back./I'm glad to see you again./We've been waiting for you./Back and better than ever, I see./How are things?/Why, hello there!] It is my understanding that you have completed one of our tasks. Do you have anything to report?
7294 : Let me take a look... Why, this % is broken! I'll give you another one, but you really must be more careful with something so valuable.
7295 : Let me take a look... This % is broken. Unfortunately, it's of no use to us now. Go back to the frontier station and bring back another one--whole, this time!
7296 : I wish you speed upon your journey.
7297 : You're not a registered pioneer? I am only authorized to give tasks to those with the appropriate credentials.
7298 : Come back when you have the requisite certification.
7299 : Since you're already here, why not take a few minutes to fill out the forms? It won't take long.
7300 : Our records don't seem to mention you. Is this your first time accepting a coalition assignment? Then let me take a moment to explain a bit more about what we do.
7301 : The six coalitions here in Adoulin each require the help of pioneers in their own way to support the colonization effort. These tasks both directly and indirectly support the colonization effort.
7302 : We will, of course, pay appropriate recompense to those completing these assignments. Further, the Twelve Orders will recognize your efforts as you continue to accomplish these goals, and may even provide you with more important duties as you begin to make a name for yourself.
7303 : Perhaps more significantly, the influence of each coalition will expand as more pioneers fulfill these obligations, and the Twelve Orders will permit them to expand.
7304 : This, in turn, will enable the coalitions to increase the number and quality of the services they provide, thereby enabling them to contribute to the colonization project even more.
7305 : Likewise, if one coalition does not receive enough pioneer support, it may shrink in scale, even if it had previously expanded. It is for this reason that we try to make our assignments as lucrative as feasible.
7306 : However, we want to ensure that all pioneers are able to contribute equally. As such, the number of coalition assignments that can be undertaken each day is governed by a system comprised of imprimaturs.
7307 : You will have to part with one imprimatur per job you undertake. Each pioneer may possess up to # of such permits, with additional imprimaturs distributed at set intervals.
7308 : In your case, we will render you with a total of # imprimaturs every # hours (Earth time). They will be held for you at assignment desks.
7309 : One benefit of this system is that you are able to contribute at your own pace. You may save up imprimaturs over a period of time and fill many orders at once, or you may instead use them as they come in.
7310 : Additionally, you can choose to spend multiple imprimaturs for one task. Predictably, you will receive rewards commensurate with the number of imprimaturs used.
7311 : The convenience of pioneers was our foremost priority when establishing this system. You may use all your imprimaturs to support a particular coalition, or you may instead choose to distribute them among several.
7312 : You may also cancel an assignment after it has been accepted. Any imprimaturs used will be returned to you--unless this would put you over the maximum amount, in which case they will be destroyed.
7313 : There is another aspect of the system I have not yet touched on: coalition referendums.
7314 : The coalition referendums help determine how a particular coalition is going to expand. Pioneers are able to vote on which direction the coalition should head.
7315 : When you complete an assignment, you will be asked to choose which plan the coalition should prioritize.
7316 : A coalition's expansion and services are inexorably intertwined, so take ample stock of which services are on offer before casting your ballot.
7317 : The expansion process will take approximately one week (Earth time). Note that coalitions that have not received much pioneer contribution will not expand.
7318 : I know this is a lot of information to take in, but it is an essential part of your pioneering activities in Ulbuka.
7319 : Since this is your first time here, I shall provide you with a total of # imprimaturs so that you may get started right away.
7320 : What would you like to do? (# imprimatur[/s]) Undertake a coalition assignment. Report on a completed assignment. Cancel an in-progress assignment. Check imprimatur distribution time. Hear an explanation of the system. End the conversation.
7321 : What's this, then? You don't have any imprimaturs? Hmm... You needn't be overly worried, for the next batch will be distributed in # [second/minute][/s].
7322 : Select which assignment to cancel.
7323 : Really cancel? Yes. No.
7324 : I have filled out this form stating your cancellation, and restored your imprimaturs to their original amount.
7325 : This makes for a total of # imprimatur[/s] currently in your possession.
7326 : The next batch of imprimaturs will be distributed in # [second/minute][/s].
7327 : You seem to be in possession of the maximum number of imprimaturs. If you do not use them before the next distribution, you will not receive any additional ones.
7328 : We look forward to seeing you again.
7329 : We are currently able to offer you the following coalition assignments.
7330 : Unfortunately, we do not currently have any assignments for you to undertake.
7331 : Select how many imprimaturs you would like to expend for this assignment.
7332 : How many will you use? (Total: #). One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Hang on one moment.
7333 : Use # imprimatur[/s]? Of course! No way.
7334 : You used # imprimatur[/s], and currently have a stock of #.
7335 : Return here once you have completed your assignment. We appreciate your assistance and hope for your safe return.
7336 : Your report was quite valuable. Thank you. We ask that you submit your vote in the coalition referendum before receiving your reward.
7337 : Select which item the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition should prioritize in its expansion plan.
7338 : Truly abstain from voting? Yes. Voting is institutionalized coercion. No. Democracy is a privilege.
7339 : It's a shame you feel that way. Still, you deserve proper compensation. Here you go.
7340 : Would you like to vote this way? Yes. It's my Goddess-given duty. No. My vote doesn't count anyway.
7341 : [Really? That?/Are you sure?/I can't believe.../Hmm.../That's not the way I would have taken it...] Well, I suppose that's why it's your vote, and not mine. What's important is that you expressed your opinion. And now, your compensation.
7342 : I congratulate you on your success and am pleased to hear your report. The coalition has prepared a reward befitting your contributions.
7343 : In addition to the standard compensation, I also hereby present you with this %. A little bird dropped it off, and I feel that it would be best in your capable hands.

7384 : You must head to [Western Adoulin/Eastern Adoulin/Rala Waterways/Ceizak Battlegrounds/Yahse Hunting Grounds/Foret de Hennetiel/Morimar Basalt Fields/Yorcia Weald/Marjami Ravine/Kamihr Drifts/Sih Gates/Moh Gates/Cirdas Caverns/Dho Gates/Woh Gates/Outer Ra'Kaznar/Ra'Kaznar Inner court/mei/mgk] and find an item that a pioneer lost there. The assignment will be considered completed if you find %.
7385 : However, the pioneer may have dropped it in [Western Adoulin/Eastern Adoulin/Rala Waterways/Ceizak Battlegrounds/Yahse Hunting Grounds/Foret de Hennetiel/Morimar Basalt Fields/Yorcia Weald/Marjami Ravine/Kamihr Drifts/Sih Gates/Moh Gates/Cirdas Caverns/Dho Gates/Woh Gates/Outer Ra'Kaznar/Ra'Kaznar Inner Court/mei/mgk] instead.

7387 : Not just any special attack will do. You must be the victim of a special attack that the Mummers' Coalition can use in one of its myriad forms of artistic expression.
7388 : Alternatively, the objective may also be completed by being the victim of a special attack in the creatures' secondary habitat of [Western Adoulin/Eastern Adoulin/Rala Waterways/Ceizak Battlegrounds/Yahse Hunting Grounds/Foret de Hennetiel/Morimar Basalt Fields/Yorcia Weald/Marjami Ravine/Kamihr Drifts/Sih Gates/Moh Gates/Cirdas Caverns/Dho Gates/Woh Gates/Outer Ra'Kaznar/Ra'Kaznar Inner Court/mei/mgk], which is located nearby.
7389 : You must head to the frontier station in [Western Adoulin/Eastern Adoulin/Rala Waterways/Ceizak Battlegrounds/Yahse Hunting Grounds/Foret de Hennetiel/Morimar Basalt Fields/Yorcia Weald/Marjami Ravine/Kamihr Drifts/Sih Gates/Moh Gates/Cirdas Caverns/Dho Gates/Woh Gates/Outer Ra'Kaznar/Ra'Kaznar Inner Court/mei/mgk] and cheer up the staff located there. The assignment will be considered completed if you successfully raise their spirits.
7390 : Alternatively, the objective may also be completed by raising the spirits of those in the nearby area of [Western Adoulin/Eastern Adoulin/Rala Waterways/Ceizak Battlegrounds/Yahse Hunting Grounds/Foret de Hennetiel/Morimar Basalt Fields/Yorcia Weald/Marjami Ravine/Kamihr Drifts/Sih Gates/Moh Gates/Cirdas Caverns/Dho Gates/Woh Gates/Outer Ra'Kaznar/Ra'Kaznar Inner Court/mei/mgk], as they are in need of encouragement as well.

7395 : We also give additional rewards based on the degree of construction or the durability of the facility to those pioneers brave enough to travel far distances or into particularly dangerous territory.
7396 : We also give additional rewards based on the extent of the survey to those pioneers brave enough to travel far distances or into particularly dangerous territory.
7397 : [Why, hello there, my dear pioneer!/Good day to you./Hello, pioneer./Welcome to our establishmentaru!/I hope you're having a marvelous-warvelous day!/Welcome back!] Is there anything you'd like to know about the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition?
7398 : What would you like to know about? The [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition's role. The state of the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition. Types of coalition assignments. Current expansion plans. Coalition referendum support. Your current standing. Nothing.
7399 : The Pioneers' Coalition contributes to the colonization effort mainly by cultivating uninhabitable territory and preparing the necessary resources to do so.
7400 : It would take no stretch of the imagination to say that our coalition is the standard-bearer for the whole movement, what with all the brave young men and women that swell our ranks.
7401 : The maester who leads our family of settlers is Lhe Lhangavo from the Order of Karieyh. She's possibly the most passionate of any order leader, and certainly one of the most caring. She's always looking out for her subordinates.
7402 : The Peacekeepers' Coalition has the most self-explanatory name I'm sure you've ever heard. We work towards making Adoulin a safer place.
7403 : We're composed of only the most dedicated and dutiful individuals--people willing to give their lives to protect this town and its populace.
7404 : The great--though often grumpy--Gratzigg is our maester, but despite his sour demeanor, he's the most loyal of anyone in the Twelve Orders. His love for Adoulin has saved it from utter despair more times than I care to remember.
7405 : The Couriers' Coalition does its part by transporting supplies to the front lines. We also ensure the integrity of every shipment's cargo.
7406 : We're very punctual and really strict about getting our deliveries right. We have the reputation of being uptight because of it, but it's those qualities that keep the pioneering movement going.
7407 : Reginald serves as our maester. He may not be the most talkative person you've ever met, but just try to find a more gentlemanly gentleman among the Twelve Orders.
7408 : The Scouts' Coalition gathers intelligence from all over the continentaru and analyzes unknown materials to further the colonization movement.
7409 : The knowledge our coalition accrues, coupled-woupled with our innate knack for careful archival supervision, makes us indispensable in this era.
7410 : Our maestaru, Margret, belongs to the Order of Haverton. Her sheer brilliance-williance makes appetizers out of even the most difficult problems, so it's no wonder that she is seen as one of the greatest minds in Adoulin.
7411 : The Inventors' Coalition mainly supportarus pioneers and the colonization of Ulbuka through the development of tools and equipment.
7412 : We provide an economic foundation-wation for the city and the pioneering movement by using the materials pioneers bring us to create new foodstuffs that can last an ocean voyage, along with new articles to outfitaru explorers.
7413 : Our maester is the one-and-only Amchuchu from the Order of Orvail. Her skills and mind are more renowned than possibly any other maester in Adoulin's history-wistory, making her one of our most talented technicians.
7414 : The number one concern for the Mummers' Coalition is pioneer morale.
7415 : It may seem like all we do is spout japes and cavort about, but there is a method to our apparent madness. Soothing the spirits of pioneers has a proven economic benefit, so expect to see Mummer-sponsored events for some time to come.
7416 : Flaviria from the Order of Thurandaut heads our troupe, and I've never seen anyone who can spin a yarn or tell a joke quite like her. It's obvious that someone with her personality would be loved by both the nobility and common folk.
7417 : The [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition is currently rank number #.
7418 : According to the most recent surveys, this coalition [is a blight on the city./is nothing to write home about./isn't half bad./is expanding nicely./is a credit to the city./puts others to shame!/is a paragon of prosperity!] [You might want to try to remedy that./Keep trying./Your efforts are starting to pay off./That said, you're still only halfway to the top./Feel free to gloat about your accomplishments./I hope you're not afraid of heights, because you're incredibly close to the top!/How's the view from the top? Great? Then keep up the excellent work!]
7419 : You've all been [abysmal/uninspiring/decent/remarkable/positively miraculous] at accomplishing your coalition assignments. Our coalition's rank [will almost certainly fall/may fall/will probably stay about the same/might rise/will almost certainly rise] after the next evaluation.
7420 : You want to know about the services offered by the [Pioneers'/Peacekeepers'/Couriers'/Scouts'/Inventors'/Mummers'] Coalition? Well, we offer[.../ nothing at the moment. Sorry.]

7434 : What assignments will you ask about? Procuring resources. Clearing the way. Preserving the peace. Patrols. Base provisions. Delivering supplies. Frontline support. Land surveys. Component analysis. Gathering materials. Recovering lost articles. Behavioral research. Morale boosting. Nothing.
7435 : Head out into the world and gather vital pioneering resources via methods such as mining and logging. Simply purchasing the supplies tells the coalition nothing of your abilities, however, and those who do will receive no remuneration.
7436 : It may seem like a thankless job, but the erection of coalition expansions and frontier stations demands constant provisioning, so it is not a task to be taken lightly.
7437 : Natural obstacles pop up from time to time, and pioneers are often asked to engage in a bit of bushwhacking to clear them away so the colonization movement can proceed. The only way to be officially recognized for such feats, though, is by participating in Colonization Reives.
7438 : The perils are aptly named, for many pioneers have fallen in attempts to rid the land of them. So many, in fact, that Maester Lhangavo was bereft of a few fur clumps for some time worrying over the issue.
7439 : Peace in Adoulin is a precarious thing. Fiends could assault the city at any moment, which is why we need to nip this problem in the bud. Join Lair Reives to eliminate their breeding grounds and contribute to the colonization effort.
7440 : If only the instinct to rebuild their homes were not so engrained in these hellions, life would be much easier for us. Sadly, you'll need to participate in these reives periodically in order to keep Ulbuka habitable.
7441 : While the Peacekeepers' Coalition often makes its rounds in the city itself, these patrols will take you to specific jungle locales for the express purpose of culling unwanted pests. Make sure to slay your quota, though, or you won't receive any recognition for your deeds.
7442 : Give Adoulin's population some peace of mind by embarking on these expeditions every so often. Also, rumors about far more terrifying beasts are likely to surface the further we progress into Ulbuka's interior, but as long as you stick to your duties, you should have no reason to fear them.
7443 : For these assignments, you'll need to transport provisions to the sites of future frontier stations. You can now use waypoints and still receive commendations, but be prepared to hear stories about back in my day, we had to walk all the way out and back on our own two feet, from some wily veterans.
7444 : Frontier stations are paramount to sustaining the colonization effort. Tasks of greater magnitude can't even begin without one, so building these structures should always be a priority.
7445 : You will sometimes be charged with carrying supplies from specific frontier stations to the Couriers' Coalition.
7446 : By supplies, I mean ones obtained in the jungle through pioneering. Yes, acting as a beast of burden may not be the most glamorous duty, but it is a vital one if we're to improve the coalitions and keep Adoulin economically stable.
7447 : The most effective way of supporting those risking their lives on the front lines is by supplying designated frontier bivouacs with the necessary provisions. While it may go against previous Couriers' Coalition policy, the use of waypoints is henceforth permitted on this type of assignment.
7448 : Truth be told, frontier bivouacs are not as developed as their station counterparts, but they still play an important role in the colonization of the continent. If they don't receive provisions regularly, our supply lines to the stations will wither and die.
7449 : Travel to places unknown in search of ergon loci, areas overflowing with natural energy. While some say it's the journey--not the destination--that matters, failing to survey even a single locus will leave you both depleted of energy and empty-handed.
7450 : The potency of an ergon tincture is highly dependent upon the strength of the ergon locus from which it's extracted, so a thorough investigation must be made into each location if we're to successfully use this trump card we've created.
7451 : Completion of these assignments means providing the Scouts' Coalition--and no others, for they are the only ones to possess the proper facilities--with unique and extraordinary materials from certain territories.
7452 : The jungle is teeming with obscure and unfamiliar substances, and from them we hope to derive more powerful and effective materials with which to aid the colonization effort. Science waits for no man, however, and without periodic deliveries of new samples, our research will stagnate.
7453 : The proper equipment and tools are instrumental in the colonization movement's progress--and the Inventors' Coalition apparently wants to be the one to corner the market.
7454 : While the Inventors' Coalition doesn't particularly care how you obtain what they ask for once you're in the specified location, they are quite picky about the number you obtain and the fact that you can't deliver to anyone else.
7455 : Pioneers are an intrepid band of adventurers, but the nature of their trade makes them prone to losing personal effects. Pick up any lost articles in the territory to which you are dispatched and return for a reward along with a pat on the back.
7456 : This is probably the least garish service the Mummers' Coalition provides, but it's one for which pioneers throughout Adoulin are eternally grateful.
7457 : Though they may not be the friendliest of Ulbuka's inhabitants, that doesn't mean the fiends who populate the continent can't teach us a thing or two. Research designated beasts by personally experiencing their special attacks and report what they taught you...if you live to tell the tale.
7458 : The Mummers' Coalition is constantly searching for its muse in all manner of sources, one being the myriad monsters scattered throughout the jungle. Investigating monsters' behavior may be just the inspiration they need to concoct new dances, gags, and events!
7459 : The isolation of the frontier can eat at even the most independent of us, which is why it's important to give our pioneers something to cheer about. Head to specified frontier stations and lift the spirits of the workers there! Just remember that if they don't smile, you don't get rewarded.
7460 : Dance, sing, shout, or generally make a fool of yourself. It doesn't matter how you do it, as long as you can make them laugh and forget their cares for a few moments.
7461 : This coalition is edified as much as possible, and therefore we have no plans to expand.
7462 : Which plan do you want to learn about? Coalition flag. Signboard. Emblem. Second floor. Adoulinian flag. Main terrace. Bay roof. Main chimney. None.
7463 : If the [/coalition flag/signboard/emblem/second floor/Adoulinian flag/main terrace/bay roof/main chimney] expansion plan succeeds, the staff in charge of [Gathering Goods/Gathering Goods II/Gathering Equipment/Gathering Technique Knowledge/Colonization Support Provisions/Gathering Goods III/Gathering Equipment II/Colonization Support Provisions II/Gathering Technique Knowledge II] will [increase in number/expand throughout the continent/provide additional services/be more successful].

7471 : If the [/coalition flag/signboard/emblem/second floor/Adoulinian flag/main terrace/bay roof/main chimney] expansion plan succeeds, the staff in charge of [Ergon Tinctures/Synthesis Support Provisions/Arcane Glyptics Price Reduction/Arcane Glyptics Materials/Growth Agents and Materials/Synthesis Support Provisions II/Arcane Glyptics Price Reduction II/Growth Agents and Materials Price Reduction/Travel Provisions] will [increase in number/expand throughout the continent/provide additional services/be more successful].

7493 : Thanks for coming all this way. I'd love to offer you some hospitality, but we'd need to get this frontier station completed first! Could you lend us a hand by signing up for a coalition assignment?
7494 : Thanks so much for delivering this %! I can't wait to see how this station looks once it's built. If you want, you can go pick up your reward from the manager who gave you this assignment.
7495 : We're glad you tried your best, but destroyed % are useless to us. Sorry, but can you pick up another one from the manager in charge?
7496 : Welcome to the frontier! This station has already been built, but you can always help construct some bivouacs or keep them supplied.
7497 : Frontier stations are self-sufficient, but the bivouacs are sadly not. We'd be extremely appreciative if you could undertake some assignments to make sure they stay in operation.
7498 : Hello, there! We have some materials we'd like delivered to town, but we have to go through the right channels. Would you mind undertaking a coalition assignment to transport them back?
7499 : Thank you for helping us out. Here's the %. All we ask is that you take it to the manager in charge of this assignment.
7500 : Thank you for helping us out. All we ask is that you deliver your cargo safely to the manager in charge of this assignment.
7501 : Well, here's another %, but please be careful not to break this one.
7502 : Good day to you. This is [the future site of /]frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5].
7503 : Thank you for the %. We greatly appreciate your efforts to [help set up/provision] frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5]. Please speak with the manager in charge of this assignment to collect your reward.
7504 : I'm terribly sorry, but we can't use broken %. Could you please return to the coalition assignment desk and procure us another?
7505 : How nice it is to see another face out here! As much as I'd like for you to help us set up frontier bivouac [#1/#2/#3/#4/#5], we won't be able to do anything until we've established a base of operations with a frontier station.
7506 : The magical properties of the waypoint proved too much for your % to handle, and it broke...
7507 : This seems to be the site of the ergon locus oft called the [/Flourishing Island/Bud of the Swarm/Luminous Isle/Immutable Boulder/Immaculate Sands/Fruit of Fecundity/Dragon Driftwood/Torchbloom/Spring of Prosperity/Snowdrift Arbor/Frostbloom/Prominence of the Gales/Lake of Light/Sweltering Spring/Prominence of the Flame]. It is most likely worth surveying.
7508 : This seems to be the site of the ergon locus oft called the [Sanctum of Life/Prominence of the Soil/Pool of Clarity/Bryophitic Boulder/Overgrown Grove/Whitewater Arbor/Bud of the Fragrant Breeze/Crag of the Triumvirate/Prominence of the Ripple/Saliferous Spring/Loch of Flux/Lambent Pillar/Crystalline Claw/Prominence of the Rime/Halcyon Icefall]. It is most likely worth surveying.
7509 : Commence survey? Yes. No.
7510 : [Your survey is a success./You have already surveyed an ergon locus in the area.] Return to the manager in charge and report on what you have learned about the ergon locus's attributes.
7511 : Your survey has ended in utter failure. The time of day and distance from which you surveyed could very well be to blame.

7514 : You have found %. As it likely belongs to a pioneer, you surmise that you should deliver it to the manager in charge of your assignment.
7515 : You have already found a lost article. As much as it pains you to ignore someone's plight, you decide to deliver the one currently in your possession to the manager in charge of your assignment.
7516 : A small article resembling a pouch lies unattended on the ground. Could someone have dropped this...?

7518 : It's so tough constructing frontier stations. It's always build, build, build, and scrounge, scrounge, scrounge. All I want is a little break from the monotony of it all.
7519 : It's so tough maintaining a frontier station. I'm always fending off bloodthirsty hellions and scrounging for provisions. All I want is a little break from the monotony of it all.
7520 : What will you do? Look pleased. Cry a river. Act surprised. Rue your life. Cheer. Pretend to be flustered. Blush like a maiden. Rally the troops. Nothing for now.
7521 : Ahahaha! Of all the things to pull, I never thought you'd do that! I had no idea that was coming.
7522 : Um...is something the matter with you? Maybe you should see a physician...
7523 : Approaching from that direction [might not have been very effective/was probably the right thing to do.]. As for your gag, [it wasn't with the times/it was right on the mark].
7524 : You don't know how much I needed something like that. Thank you.
7525 : [Construction on /]Frontier Bivouac #[1/2/3/4/5] is[/ currently at] # percent [complete/durability]. We are in need of [materials with which to set up camp/provisions], so would it be possible for you to undertake a coalition assignment and assist us in [building this thing/keeping this place running]?

7740 : It's f-freezing-weezing out here! Why are we colonizing such a terrible place?

7743 : He seems to be trying to say something, but his voice is too soft to make out.
7744 : When I said that we should put c-c-colonization on icey-wice, this isn't what I had in mind! Brrr...
7745 : The terrain is rugged enough on its own, with all these tuftarus of snow...but ice walls blocking our progress? It's t-too much!
7746 : Thankfully, my geomancer friend Traiffeaux can crush them into a fine powder!
7747 : I say thankfully, but he's been babbling like a baby for the pastaru I-don't-know-how-many hours.
7748 : What will you do? Ask him to speak up. Leave in despair.
7749 : <Shuffle> <shuffle>
7750 : <Shuffle> (You are a p-patient one, aren't you?)
7751 : (The Kamihr Drifts are long known as a place of t-training and ritual for geomancers of old, and so, too, have I chosen to make this p-pilgrimage.)
7752 : (My voice is so s-soft because I am attuning my senses to the region so I can become one with n-nature... Can you even hear me?)
7753 : Can you hear him? Of course. Why would I even want to?
7754 : (Then leave me to my devices.)
7755 : (Then t-tell that little toy soldier over there to stop pestering me to break down the walls while I am t-training.)
7756 : Will you tell the Taru to stop? Sure. Wait. What if you taught me how?
7757 : (I appreciate your th-thoughtfulness, but there's no way he will lend an ear to my plight.)
7758 : (You raise an interesting p-point. If I imparted my knowledge to you, then you could d-do as he asks...and in turn, I can resume my regimen.)
7759 : (You must f-focus all your thoughts on the ice. Become the ice. Find its eye--the weakest point--and s-smash into it with all your might.)
7760 : (S-sounds easy? Well, it is not. No, I predict it would take you...[thirty/three] years to perform such a feat.)
7761 : What will you say? [Thirty/Three] years? Piece of cake! I can't even wait that many minutes...
7762 : (I admire your dedication, but...there may yet b-be another way.)
7763 : (W-wait...there may be another way.)
7764 : (If you can hear me, then p-perhaps...perhaps you could sense the changes in tone when you thump different parts of the wall.)
7765 : (This might enable you to f-find the eye.)
7766 : (I shall teach you to distinguish b-between the eye and the other parts of the ice.)
7767 : (But do not be so b-brash as to put your head directly to the ice. Your ears would just weld to the surface.)
7768 : (So what you need, then, is a n-nice pair of earmuffs.)
7769 : (G-gather three % from the snowpelt rabbits around the drifts...)
7770 : (And while you are in the vicinity, one % from a raaz.)
7771 : (I can tear myself a-away from my training long enough to make a pair for you.)
7772 : (I am s-sure you would be able to break the wall if you could hear the eye of the ice.)
7773 : (To p-protect your ears during the process, I will make you a little something if you bring me three % from rabbits and one % from a raaz.)
7774 : (That should be enough for you to accomplish your t-task.)
7775 : (I must c-confess that I thought the desolate drifts would get the better of you. Congratulations on making it back in one piece.)
7777 : (And h-here you are. Your very own %.)
7778 : (I shall accompany you to an ice w-wall. That much energy I can spare, as long as you're not that cursed Taru.)
7779 : (Y-yes. This one should do nicely.)
7780 : (I shall tap on the ice while you l-listen to the sounds with your %.)
7781 : (Are you ready? First, I will thump an a-area that is not the eye.)
7782 : (...And now, the eye itself.)
7783 : (Could you t-tell the difference?)
7784 : What's your conclusion? I think I've got it. Let's run that over again.
7785 : (Understood. Let me tap on a s-section that is not the eye.)
7786 : (That is all the help I am able to p-provide. You should now be able to break such walls by striking at the eye.)
7787 : (L-let us return so we may warm our frigid bodies.)
7788 : (Knowing the location of the eye is only the f-first step. Breaking the wall requires immense physical fortitude.)
7789 : (Yet you have come this far. I am c-confident that you will see this task to its natural conclusion.)
7790 : (Breaking down the wall is b-but one of many grueling trials that you will doubtless undertake.)
7791 : (B-but all this gives me pause...why would the leafkin be in such an inhospitable place...?)
7792 : Are you...a pioneer? All the way out here? Boy, the coalition sure is expanding-wanding fast!
7793 : Brrrrrrrrr...
7794 : <Shiver> My toes are going to freeze off and break into little bitarus!
7795 : Orsa-Porsa!? Why are you here instead of bathing in the Morimar Basaltaru Fields hot springs?
7796 : Aha. They sentaru you to do some research over here.
7797 : Correctaru. Just research. Unlike you, I haven't been shoved off to this Altana-forsaken wasteland because I couldn't keep my mouth shut.
7798 : M-mouth shut!? Whaddaya mean?
7799 : Wha--!? You always were oblivious to a faultaru, but this is too much!
7800 : Don't you remember how you threw yourself at that dainty-wainty little tart at the Inventors' Coalition?
7801 : I tried to warn you, but noooooo. You just had to send her that handpicked bouquet of flowers that you probably found wiltaruing in Foret de Hennetiel.
7802 : I-I nearly threw my back out looking for only the prettiest-wittiest henneblooms I could find! She's my dream girl, and I would do anything for her!
7803 : If she were just any old technician, you might have gotten away with a slap on the wristaru--but she was Amchuchu's hairdresser's sister! You know how the maester can be.
7804 : Aaaaaand that's why you got forced out of the city, doomed to spend the rest of your days playing footsie with cicatricose raaz.
7805 : Y-you mean I'll never go back to Adoulin ever-wever again!? Oh no no no! What can I do?
7806 : How am I supposed to know? Maybe if you became an expert pioneer, our maester would change her mind...but don't countaru on it.
7807 : That's easy for you to say! Morimar is a lot closer to the city, plus you get to relax in the hot springs! The only remotely warm thing to bathe in around here is the slobber of some horrible beast!
7808 : Hmm... Well, maybe you'll have to become an inventor who can wow Amchuchu into submission!
7809 : But I've never been big on brains! It's all I can do to keep from getting expelled-welled from the coalition!
7810 : Look around you. You've already got one footaru in the grave.
7811 : Wait--[Mr./Ms.] Pioneer!
7812 : They made you come all the way out here too, right? Maybe if we put our noggins together, they'll letaru us both go back!
7813 : Pick your poison. Help him out. Let him languish.
7814 : Waaaaaah! I'll never see home again!
7815 : Hooray!!!
7816 : Okay, so...get to thinking!
7817 : Still nothing-wothing!? Orsa-Porsa, stop standing there like a tree stump and help me!
7818 : Wh-what do you expect me to do!? All the goo has frozen in my nose, and the icicle-wicicles on my eyelids are stabbing my cheeks!
7819 : <Chatter> I-I guess just find something we might be able to use, and think from there? Maybe something that'll help me with my research too!
7820 : <Sigh> All right. Let's see... First, for our pioneer friend-wend...
7821 : Slap around some ruszors and bring us one %!
7822 : That would be perfectaru! In the meantime, I'll do some running-wunning around, both to get my blood pumping and to see if I can <sniff> find anything.
7823 : ...He'd better come back... Okay, while you two are off, I'll put my thinking cap-wap on!
7824 : Orsa-Porsa wanted you to get one %. I have a suspicion he's more interested in his surveys than actually helping-welping me out...
7825 : But even if he's not, I'm no inventaru! Maybe I could make some kind of shovel to break down those thick walls of ice...
7826 : Hmm...that wouldn't work, though, because Traiffeaux's already found-wound some geomantic way to get around those...hmm...
7827 : You returned in one piece! And what's more, you broughtaru back %!
7828 : While you were gone, I thought of something that'll knock-wock Amchuchu's socks off for sure!
7829 : We'll use the cold to our advantage! Just flash-freeze %, pack 'em up, and send 'em to balmy Adoulin for a dessertaru that will bring a smile to even the most dour Galka's face!
7830 : But there's more! If you do the same to %, we can make hammers from them for whacking even the most stubborn of nails! Isn't that great, Orsa-Porsa!?
7831 : Uh...Orsa-Porsa...?
7832 : Oh dear...a Tarutaru popsicle. All those months stationed in the basaltaru fields must have weakened your constitution.
7833 : How can you just stand there without shattering into a million icy shards!? I don't care how many layer-wayers you're wearing! It's physiologically impossible!!!
7834 : Oh-oh! That's rightaru! I forgot to give you some of my special oil!
7835 : Special oil...?
7836 : You're here to research the fauna, so let me help. Don't you think it's odd that ruszors are able to plunge-wunge into the frigid ponds of Kamihr and pop right back out as if it were a lovely spring day?
7837 : I've spent some time analyzing %, and I stumble-wumbled on something interesting. See how sticky the underside is?
7838 : So you're using this oil...
7839 : No, no! If you slather it on like skin lotion, you'll break out into a terrible rash-wash.
7840 : I speak from experience. But I developed a method for treataruing the oil so that it's usable by people!
7841 : Ooooooh! Peppe-Aleppe, you've chanced-wanced upon something great!
7842 : And it does more than keep you warm! Have you ever been buffeted by the gusty masses that dot the drifts? It'll keep you safe from those, too!
7843 : And here you were, saying you couldn't inventaru anything!
7844 : The pioneers will love this, and I won't have to freeze my bum off! It's killing two colibri with one stone-wone!
7845 : Maybe Amchuchu will adore it, so I can go back to Adoulin and finally be with the apple-wapple of my eye--the lovely Shipilolo!
7846 : Yeaaaaaah, I don't think that'll happen-wappen.
7847 : <Wince>
7848 : But I'll put in a good word with Amchuchu for you. Maybe that'll bring-wing her around.
7849 : You should give some of that oil to our pioneer friend. There's no such thing as bad publicity-wicity!
7850 : Good idea! Here you go, [Mr./Ms.] Pioneer!
7851 : Let me show you how it works. You put the oil on your skin-win or else you get...
7852 : Gehehehe! That tickles! Gehehe!
7853 : Those shivering gusts'll be no more than a harmless breeze-weeze now!
7854 : There's one itsy-bitsy favor I'd like to ask in return. Tell all your pioneer friend-wends and everyone in Adoulin what a spectacular, indispensable person I am!
7855 : As for me, I'm gonna finish up my work here so I can skittaru back to Morimar Basalt Fields and take a nice, hot dip!
7856 : Did you see the way Orsa-Porsa danced-wanced out of here? We gave him a new lease on life!
7857 : Mind over mattaru. It's just as cold as before, but if the oil makes him happy, then that's great!
7858 : The beast's stentorian roar shakes the drifts with a thunderous rumble. A chilling cold suddenly descends upon the land, and a thick fog encapsulates the vicinity in a murky haze.
7859 : Silence that infernal racket!
7860 : What business have you in my domain? Think before you speak, <growl> for your life will be forfeit depending on your response.
7861 : What business do you have? Please, I mean you no harm. Tell me about the golden tiger. Do you know where they took Arciela?
7862 : Is that so? What then is that <growl> cacophonous device?
7863 : Ugh, my ears still ring from the horrible discord it produces. If you truly mean me no harm, you will <growl> dispose of that thing immediately...or else.
7864 : You hurriedly discard the %.
7865 : Let me guess, you had no idea how <growl> loathsome that contraption was? Your panicked manner gave it away. What an interesting stratagem. I must praise whomever outfitted you with that bell.
7866 : Such trivial topics are beneath me.
7867 : What is this? Adoulin's figurehead princess has been <growl> abducted?
7868 : Perhaps that bladed vestige of the ancient pact she hangs from her belt is simply for show. Either that or she is <growl> hardly the spitfire everyone paints her to be.
7869 : Even so, I cannot imagine any inhabitant of this jungle would dare attack her.
7870 : ...Except possibly for him...
7871 : He is the only one likely to know the whereabouts of the girl. Make for the cave that serves as his den in the southwestern corner of the drifts if you <growl> wish to find her.
7872 : H-have you come to finish what you started?
7873 : Sadly--for you--I have.
7874 : Well, I cannot say I expected to see you here, Middle Lander. In the end, though, exercising a modicum of brainpower to arrive before me only blows up in your repugnant face.
7875 : Is your head too malformed to grasp the concept of an order, Middle Lander? I thought I told you to report to the castle if you learned anything.
7876 : If you had, then I would have let you live. Instead, your paltry attempt to exercise your intellect has sealed your fate.
7877 : Do not take this personally. I did all I could to keep outsiders like you from meddling in this issue between Adoulinians.
7878 : It is what it is.
7879 : %, listen to me. The tiger is not our enemy! He actually saved me from Ingrid and her horde!
7880 : This tiger saved my life...
7881 : Be a good girl and accept your fate already!
7882 : I knew it would come to this.
7883 : Try and see if you can protect that whimpering wretch. Little did you know, I need not take one step closer with this...
7884 : My soul siphon!
7885 : Urk!
7886 : An etherial substance is wrenched from Arciela's body and wafts into Ingrid's bottle.
7887 : Gwoooooor!
7888 : Now that I have this, I have no use for its mortal husk.
7889 : Withdraw, my retainers! It is time to put the next step of our plan in motion!
7890 : (%...)
7891 : A gruff and authoritarian voice booms within your skull.
7892 : By its fearsome tone, there is no doubt it emanates from the golden-furred tiger.
7893 : (I am Darrcuiln, descendant of Terrcualn, who once presided over the entire expanse of this jungle.)
7894 : (Worry not about the girl--I shall look after her. You need only concern yourself with pursuing that foul-mouthed shrew.)
7895 : (What she would want with the soul of this maiden here is beyond me, but I cannot abide this egregious transgression.)
7896 : (Take this with you. It will enable you to discern even the faintest thaumaturgical trace of any who have trod upon my territory.)
7897 : (Sadly, however, its effects are fleeting at best. Should its potency dwindle to naught, pay me another visit and I will provision you with another forthwith.)
7898 : (Now away with you! The longer we wait, the less likely it is that we can retrieve her soul.)
7899 : Before you lies a narrow opening to a cragged tunnel, large enough for one person to pass through at a time.
7900 : Ingrid and the other exorcists likely used it to make their escape.
7901 : Proceed? Yes. No.
7902 : If I were you, Arciela, I would never forgive me for betraying you. Thus, I shall graciously accept whatever punishment you wish to mete out to me.
7903 : Look at me, Ingrid.
7904 : We may reside on opposite sides of the colonization issue, but we're both Adoulinians. This nation has no hope for survival if we resort to violence.
7905 : Isn't that right, %?
7906 : Well, is it? Never a truer word has been spoken. No. Finish her.
7907 : Someone once said Great minds think alike, and I'd like to think he was talking about us when he said it.
7908 : Haha, I haven't recovered nearly enough to inflict pain upon anyone.
7909 : You always were more willing than me to get your hands dirty, %.
7910 : Well, Ingrid, there you have it. There's no point in letting old wounds fester.
7911 : But...I took your...
7912 : My soul? Perhaps, but I'm still alive and well. That's all that really matters, right?
7913 : ...How can you be so forgiving!?
7914 : It's obvious that the exorcists' aid is vital to ensuring that colonization continues. For the good of our nation, I don't want to burn bridges that don't need to be.
7915 : Wouldn't you agree?
7916 : ...As you will.
7917 : (I would venture to say her heart is larger than Big Bridge.)
7918 : (However, that may very well...)
7919 : You look rather out of sorts, %. Is everything all right?
7920 : Is everything all right? That beast can communicate with me! Yes. I couldn't be better.
7921 : Are you sure? You seem a little tired to me.
7922 : What? You can hear him inside your head? I hate to say it, but I can't hear a thing.
7923 : Wait, could that fruit Rosulatia gave you possibly be working its magic here?
7924 : ...If it is, does that mean this's the start of a whole other saga? And here I thought we were about to find a cure for my brother's ailment...
7925 : Look at what part of Arciela? Her innocent face. Her heaving chest. Her hilt-clutching hands.
7926 : ...What's wrong? Is there something in my teeth?
7927 : ...What?
7928 : You point emphatically to the poniard she wields.
7929 : Hm? What about my brother's gesture?
7930 : You think he wasn't pointing to me, but...to Ortharsyne?
7931 : Now that I think about it, I also swear I've heard that cryptic riddle Teodor told you before...
7932 : Oh, I know!
7933 : It's remarkably similar to the poem my father would tell us as children!
7934 : I remember because his face would always become eerily grave whenever he told it.
7935 : I'm pretty sure I also heard it on the night I first saw Ortharsyne...
7936 : The poem I heard isn't exactly the same as what Teodor told you, but I believe it goes like this...
7937 : In an eage whence schade dennen his land, the ore of the swallow's witeword shalt be fulfilled.
7938 : The warants of forest shalt raise the merke blade high, and one of the whyte fether shalt florischen the swerdes sext.
7939 : Hm? So, the blade in question is Ortharsyne and the time of the prophecy is our own?
7940 : Yes, %, that must be it!
7942 : What in the...?
7943 : A...dragon.
7944 : That is the Scourge of the Land. The annals say that disaster and calamity follow in the wake of its wings, but I always assumed its existence to be more parable than fact...
7945 : The Scourge of the Land Rumored to have emerged from Vana'diel's primordial muck with the birth of the Ulbukan continent, this pearlescent wyrm inevitably appears before Adoulinians in the midst of great calamity. Therefore, the populace has come to regard its presence as an ill omen of the highest degree.
7946 : Of late, though, a new theory has been put forth by a scholarly collective. It asserts that the Scourge reveals itself not as a harbinger of crisis, but as a savior to deliver Ulbuka from cataclysmic destruction.
7947 : Neither hypothesis, however, has been proven.
7948 : It's positively gargantuan...and yet it retains such an air of dignity and grace...
7949 : Is this what my brother wanted all along? For us to call forth this regal giant?
7950 : Let's hope that the latest theory proves true and this dragon sends our nation soaring above disaster rather than up in flames.
7951 : %, you look quite pale! And with the lady Arciela in tow. Nothing pleases me more than to see you have both successfully escaped.
7952 : I have been waiting for you.
7953 : ...Teodor?
7954 : Hmm...one of you is missing.
7955 : What is that supposed to--
7956 : No!
7957 : No need to be so defensive. The two of us have a history of camaraderie together, do we not, %?
7958 : I am not now, nor have I ever been, your enemy.
7959 : (This may seem strange, Princess, but I guarantee he is on our side.)
7960 : Come. We have much to speak of, and this is not a safe place to do so.
7961 : Let us head to the summit of Mount Kamihr, where your most holy of dragons awaits.
7962 : I shall meet you there.
7963 : I don't understand. What could dear Teodor want?
7964 : (I cannot fault your trepidation, but we must make haste. This land is not safe for us anymore.)
7965 : You can set this as your current home point. Once you set a home point, you will return there whenever you are incapacitated.
7966 : Set this as current home point? Yes. No.
7967 : Home point set!
7968 : A home point can be set as a spot for you to return to Vana'diel when you have been knocked out. You can also use a home point to teleport to other home points.
7969 : What will you do? Travel to another home point. Set this as your home point. Other settings. On second thought, never mind.

8015 : A small crevice penetrates the surface of the rock.

8039 : A dreadful energy emanates from deep within the fracture!
8040 : The oppressive energy passes.
8041 : The fiend fades before your very eyes... Was it ever really there at all?
8042 : Expend your % and enter the obscured domain with your alliance members?
8043 : Proceed? Yes. No.
8044 : A dreadful energy emanates from deep within the domain!
8045 : The oppressive energy passes.
8046 : This path seems to lead toward the summit of Mount Kamihr.
8047 : Begone from here. You frail mortals should have thought twice before assscending this peak.
8048 : I have no patience for those who desssecrate the forest. Depart at once.
8049 : If you do not, then I have no choice but to ssswing the radiant hammer of vengeance down upon your meager frames!
8050 : Wait! ...Your Eminence. Before you judge us, I would like you to take a look at this.
8051 : That blade...
8052 : %, can you show him the proof of your bonds to this forest, too?
8053 : Show your %? Sounds like a plan. No can do.
8054 : You bring forth the % before the Winged Scourge.
8055 : %! Do you want to get us burned to a crisp!?
8056 : ...Or are you saying that because you <gasp> left it back in Adoulin?
8057 : Did you leave it behind? Yes, silly me. No, I've got it right here.
8058 : How could you!?
8059 : Wait a minute...
8060 : Ugh! This better be the last time you try to pull my leg like that, %! I don't think my heart can take much more.
8061 : The Winged Scourge casts a burning stare in your direction.
8062 : Hmmm... Ortharsssyne and %...
8063 : You mean to tell me that you are not like the rest of those pillagers, but ssstaunch believers in August and his desire to preserve the forest?
8064 : You refer to the founder king by his first name? So...you knew him personally?
8065 : But he lived centuries upon centuries ago! You couldn't possibly--
8066 : Of courssse I knew him, for I am Sajj'aka.
8067 : Not only did I know the first Adoulin king, I ssswore my allegiance to him.
8068 : Was it centuries ago? Millennia? Time flows for many thingsss, but upon Sajj'aka it touchesss not.
8069 : Seasss change. Landsss change. Even should the starsss fade from existence, the covenant made with Augussst shall not break.
8070 : In my eyes, the lives of your kind are as delicate and transient as bubbles in a ssstream, your moments of glory mere sssparks from flint.
8071 : Inconsssequential, insssignificant, insssubstantial--such is how I came to conceive of your peoples.
8072 : Augussst has been the only exception.
8073 : His aura shone brighter than my refulgent scales, and his resolve was ssstrong enough to wrest me from the realm of shadows.
8074 : That is not the lone justification for why my memory of him will persissst until the end of time, but it is an important one.
8075 : And what of you, ssspindly-legged foal?
8076 : Does the ressspect for the king you claim to harbor within that miniscule bosom of yours amount to even a drop in the sea compared to what I showed him while he was alive?
8077 : Well, I...
8078 : <Snort> Hopefully you can at least answer this sssimple question.
8079 : As a preface...you are aware of the ssseven guardians that protect the Ulbukan hinterland, are you not?
8080 : Yes, I am. They're the Naakuals, right?
8081 : Is that the ephemeral sssobriquet they have been given by your kind? Very well.
8082 : I shall not waste my breath explaining the ressst.
8083 : However, there was one more guardian who fought alongside August...a worthy tiger whose fur shone a lussstrous gold.
8084 : That must be Terrcualn.
8085 : I recall reading about him during one of my trips to the library. What was the title of the book, though...?
8086 : Aha, His Majesty and the Golden Beast! That's it!
8087 : Ah, booksss. An inconvenient form of immortality, but perhapsss the best your ephemeral kind can hope for. If you are truly learned, you should have no qualms about a simple tessst.
8088 : Pray tell me, where did August meet Terrcualn in combat?
8089 : Umm... Where they fought, you say? Well...that would be...
8090 : %, what do we do? I don't remember that detail at all.
8091 : ...Aha, it's a trick question! The story makes no mention of where they fought!
8092 : Confidence conceals ignorance only when the other party is ignorant as well, you misssguided fool.
8093 : In the end, you care as little for August as I care for dissemblers.
8094 : The one who saved me from that place where even the faintest hint of light is ssswallowed whole...nestlingsss such as you could never hope to fathom his greatnesss. I was foolish to believe otherwise.
8095 : I will not ssstand for this a moment longer.
8096 : I know not why you tressspassed upon this land, and I no longer care.
8097 : There is nothing left to dissscuss, for you have proven beyond a doubt that you are incapable of understanding August's will.
8098 : Remove yourselves from my presence. Our conversation has left me weary of both ssspeaking with mortals and with life itself.
8099 : I'm so embarrassed, %... I don't want to admit it, but maybe he's right after all.
8100 : It was silly of me to come here knowing so little.
8101 : If I'm to make amends, there's only one thing left to do.
8102 : %, let's burrow deep into Adoulin's vault of knowledge, leaving no page unturned in our wake!
8103 : Petulant children. Did I not ask you to be gone from my sssight?
8104 : We swear that we have no intention of harming the jungle! Please, hear our plea!
8105 : Then it is my sssworn duty as a protector of this land to confirm if your intent matches your words.
8106 : It matters little which of you engages in this tessst I am to put forth. But anger me further, and your life is forfeit.
8107 : Make light of this trial, and I shall grind your skulls between my teeth and sssuck the marrow from your bones.
8108 : We shall not.
8109 : Well, how unexpected! The [boy/girl] is putting on airs!
8110 : Yet pride always comes before a fall. Let us hope that the fire in your eyesss does not become quenched by the avalanche of failure.
8111 : And an avalanche it shall be, ssshould you make even one misstep. Let the first trial begin.
8112 : The king of legends was sssaved by a tiger whose mane looked to be woven from golden threads. Where was the site of their struggle?
8113 : Answer now, lest your flesssh be rent from your frame.
8114 : Where did the fight occur? Marjami Ravine. Yorcia Weald. Morimar Basalt Fields.
8115 : Dare the two of you mock me!?
8116 : It has been many years since I have conversssed with your kind. Perhaps you merely...misspoke. I shall grant you a reprieve.
8117 : The truth is never a low-hanging fruit, free for all to pluck. It comes only to those willing to snatch it from the heavens.
8118 : Though I did not bear witness to this truth, Terrcualn and August incessantly regaled me with every lassst detail, and I could recite the story by heart.
8119 : Beyond doubt, the two ssstruggled valiantly, with August staring straight into the abyss and dragging forth victory from its gaping maw.
8120 : Terrcualn thus chose to ssserve the fabled one, learning to love him much as I did.
8121 : Now, for the second test.
8122 : Terrcualn's cub was entrusted to one of August's most trusted generals. I assume you came across this fact in your studies.
8123 : Who was this man?
8124 : What was the man's name? Morigan. Morimar. Morison.
8125 : Do you make a mockery of August's sssacrifice? Are you such a buffoon that you cannot answer so much as the name of the man who fought by his side?
8126 : If only he knew that... No. I must have misheard.
8127 : Come, tell me your anssswer once more.
8128 : Yes, that is correct. A truly powerful individual indeed, though his ssstar did not shine as brightly as his lord's.
8129 : August's eleven generals were the only men and women to ever move my heart. That remainsss true to this day.
8130 : Let us move to the final quessstion.
8131 : When all seemed lost and the king made his last ssstand, where was it that he fought tooth and claw?
8132 : Where did the last battle occur? Abyssea. Promyvion. The Serpentine Labyrinth.
8133 : Never have I heard tales of such a location, but its name alone sends shivers up my ssspine.
8134 : I deign to give you one more chance.
8135 : That is correct. Young one, you have prepared well for this encounter.
8136 : I recognize you as heritors to August's will, and will grant you one brief audience.
8137 : Phew...
8138 : %, I'm always glad to have you by my side. I don't know what I would've done...
8139 : There are limitsss to that which man has recorded in his annals, but as I said before--truth is a fruit found only by the intellectually ravenous.
8140 : Then you know details hidden from our eyes and ears?
8141 : Beyond doubt.
8142 : Sajj'aka, you mentioned that it was August--the founder king--who released you.
8143 : Your memory is sssharp as a fresh blade, young one. And what about you, [son/daughter] of man?
8144 : Do you recall this tale?
8145 : Does the story sound familiar? Yes, it does. Not one iota.
8146 : Hmm... I had taken you both for fools, but now I sssee that you are worthy.
8147 : Ha...hahaha!
8148 : Quite the show you've put on for me! But your honesssty and candor are refreshing.
8149 : Be thankful that your friend is both meticulousss and sound of mind.
8150 : Yes, that tale is yet another in this series of truthsss. I am not of Ulbukan origin.
8151 : The time is not right for me to explain the ssstory in its entirety, but suffice to say...
8152 : I was long chained down in a terrible domain, and it was the king who releasssed me from my prison.
8153 : Never again will I return there. Nor will they...
8154 : What will you ask? But isn't it your homeland? Who are they?
8155 : Homeland. Quite the pretty phrase, washing away reality with a thin veneer of nossstalgia. No, my homeland is not a place to which I desire to return.
8156 : And I will take no further questionsss on the matter.
8157 : You mentioned earlier the beings you know as the Naakuals.
8158 : So...you have vanquished them.
8159 : Perhaps it is as he said...I should not look down on the [sssons/daughtersss] of man.
8160 : As who said?
8161 : Sajj'aka...
8162 : As pioneers whose charge is to open up the jungle, clashes with the Naakuals are inevitable. We knew it from the very beginning.
8163 : Hmm...pioneering... Unsssurprising, given that they are the guardians of Ulbuka.
8164 : We are quite alike, the Naakualsss and I. We are all residents of a land we cannot call our own, rescued from fate by the one you call the founder king.
8165 : They obeyed his will much like I did, and when he ordered them to guard sssix locations around Ulbuka, they were bound to obey. That is how they came to protect this land.
8166 : The ancient pact declared that they were to remain dissstant from the affairs of mortals and shelter the jungle from harm.
8167 : Their calling is to shelter the jungle...?
8168 : Yet countlesss years have passed since the king made his request manifest. Perhaps too many years.
8169 : Some who witnessed those times firsthand have had their memories fade as the centuries passed, and have long forgotten the very reason for their sssworn task.
8170 : And not jussst the why...but also the what.
8171 : You may call them the protectors of the land, young one, but you are sssorely mistaken.
8172 : It is not the jungle they pledged to protect.
8173 : I don't understand.
8174 : They were scattered throughout the six reaches of Ulbuka, to be sssure, but not for the reason you think.
8175 : They were sent to guard the six entrances to what you refer to as the Serpentine Labyrinth.
8176 : Then the Serpentine Labyrinth...is more than just a myth?
8177 : When August made his last ssstand, he bid Morimar and I to return to the surface without him.
8178 : Our purpose--given by the king himself--was not to guard his side. It was to deliver his orders unto...
8179 : ...the Naakuals. They were to seal the entrances to the labyrinth and ensure that nary so much as a man's breath penetrate into its recesses.
8180 : Sajj'aka! Let me interject.
8181 : You said that the Naakuals are to guard the six entrances to the Serpentine Labyrinth.
8182 : Correct.
8183 : Our annals state that there are seven Naakuals, but you mention only six entrances.
8184 : Then where is the seventh one? What is he protecting?
8185 : He was...different from the rest.
8186 : In ancient times, he was referred to as The Deathborne Xol, and his purpose was to ssserve the hallowed leader of the Cimmerian Adherents.
8187 : You mean...August's sworn enemies?
8188 : Indeed. He was one of the Xol Triumvirate.
8189 : But during his fierce classshes with August, he came to see the light.
8190 : I know not where he is or what his tasssk is. Perhaps...
8191 : No, ssspeculation is not my forte. He is impossible for me to read.
8192 : Sajj'aka, I have more to ask you.
8193 : August's sword--Ortharsyne--led me here to this very spot.
8194 : Before I began private tutelage, my father often read to us a poem, and one verse sticks out to me to this day: When disaster is nigh and evil has descended, brandish the sword to the heavens, and all shall be mended.
8195 : The light that pierced the sky signaled the top of this peak. I know the founder king left something--or someone--very important with you.
8196 : But Ortharsyne was not our only beacon.
8197 : The twinned World Tree, whose power wanes even as we speak, gave % to %...as it gave something to you.
8198 : The winds of change are sweeping Ulbuka, threatening to blow away all she embraces.
8199 : And this change bodes ill for all of us. Horrific beasts of unforeseen origin are appearing in greater numbers by the day. Landshivers threaten to knock over even the stoutest building in Adoulin. Trees wither and die, and the water runs foul.
8200 : Tell me, Sajj'aka--why? Why is this happening? Isn't there anything we can do to stop it?
8201 : Please. If you know anything, share it with us!
8202 : ...
8203 : The seals on the Serpentine Labyrinth wear thin. The spirits of the past are beginning to reawaken.
8204 : The spirits of the past...do you mean those who commanded the Cimmerian Adherents?
8205 : None other. Despite his monumental strength, even August was not able to vanquisssh them. Merely sealing them within the labyrinth's confines took all of his strength. And yet he succeeded in stopping him...
8206 : The Lord of the Serpentine Labyrinth...Hades.
8207 : So this entity...has a name.
8208 : Darkness threatens to choke this land once more. He returnsss.
8209 : The sssmell of the wind...the undulations of the land... It is now as it was then.
8210 : Like a harsh wind chipping away at a boulder, his return is sluggish...but inevitable.
8211 : And what then? When he returns to Ulbuka?
8212 : You too, child, must sssense it. Forces antithetical to all life strengthen with each passing day.
8213 : As they wax, the power of the World Tree wanes.
8214 : Having lost its twin, it coalesced all its energies into its roots and took hold deep within Ulbukan soil.
8215 : It then ssspread throughout the land, quelling all the evil that sought to consume it.
8216 : Countless years have passed since then, and, as the World Tree aged, it began to lose its potency.
8217 : The landshivers are but a physical manifessstation of this phenomenon. Each shudder is the World Tree trembling in agony.
8218 : And what...what if its power is completely lost?
8219 : Then all that August worked to contain will ssspill out onto the surface.
8220 : Hades' wait is almost over, his black heart is growing stronger as we speak.
8221 : Calamity will befall us once again.
8222 : The air a stifling miasma, the water a fetid pool, the land a shattered palisade, and the jungle a lifeless husk.
8223 : Black flames will scourge the forest, rending all life from stem to ssstern, spelling a brutal end for us all.
8224 : This is the inevitable conclusion of all we have faced so far!? How...how can we stop it?
8225 : We cannot.
8226 : It can't be... Sajj'aka, you stared into the Serpentine Labyrinth and lived. You must know something--!
8227 : Young child and her young friend... I am but a relic of the passst.
8228 : Would that August were alive, things may be different. If not his body, then at least his ssspirit...
8229 : But it is still chained within the Serpentine Labyrinth's most inner recessses.
8230 : During August's crusade, he was ruthlessly devoted to his cause, and the World Tree was at the height of its power.
8231 : And I had just been freed, my blood boiling for revenge.
8232 : These three forces combined to seal that dark malady deep within.
8233 : Yet dessspite the most favorable of circumstances, we failed to eliminate the threat completely.
8234 : This time, we have no light of hope to guide us.
8235 : Though I remain in this realm, I still bear the wounds I suffered during that ssstruggle.
8236 : As I alluded to before, even if I were healthy, the founder king's ssspirit is trapped, and the World Tree has begun to crumble.
8237 : Yet despite all this, mankind insists on working its utmost to destroy the wilds!
8238 : And here I sit, bearing the same injury...and even you and your lot I would forgive. But my heart still pulses with rage at the mere thought of the evil sealed away!
8239 : What will you do? Pet and comfort him. Unleash a feral scream.
8240 : How can you possibly underssstand my pain!?
8241 : How many times must we knock them down before they cease to rise up once more!?
8242 : %! Wh-whatever has gotten into you!?
8243 : Ssstop that this instant!
8244 : <Sigh> Forgive my sudden outburssst.
8245 : Whatever the case, our three lights of hope have been extinguished.
8246 : But, surely there must be something? Maybe if there was some way to save the World Tree...
8247 : The world is made up of one sssimple truth: if something can grow old, it can die.
8248 : But perhaps...perhaps there is a way to reverse the process.
8249 : What will you inquire? What are you proposing? What can we do?
8250 : Firssst, a brief lesson. The World Tree's origins lie not in Ulbuka.
8251 : To hear August tell it, he had retrieved a young branch of the World Tree from a far-off land, and planted it here, in this continent.
8252 : It sprang forth from the sssoil and began to bud before one turn of the moon, its limbs stretching so high they must have touched Altana herself.
8253 : If we were to do the same thing... ...And this time, the rootsss are already here to work with.
8254 : So if we were to find a similar branch...
8255 : Then the World Tree would burssst into existence much as it did then...only faster.
8256 : But the question remains--where did he possibly find such an object?
8257 : A Lightsland. The World Tree grew in a sssanctified place filled with light and surrounded by serene waters.
8258 : In a place that was once called Rhazowa.
8259 : There was once a Lightsssland on that frozen continent... ...Nevertheless, its presence is but a memory etched onto a tattered canvas.
8260 : Rhazowa...we only know it as a land wrapped in the flames of war.
8261 : But I can feel it...a spark of brilliance located within a ssstifling place.
8262 : When the World Tree sssensed changes occurring here, it gifted a piece of itself, creating a new Lightsland here.
8263 : I can feel it. Soft vibrations in the land, calling me there.
8264 : If it's as simple as going there, then--
8265 : No. Even though you have seen the reality, there is nothing you can do.
8266 : I, and I alone, have the power to accesss the Lightsland.
8267 : But the trauma I have sssuffered is too great, and my constitution is too frail.
8268 : Those blasphemous entities ssstripped me of my scales, cursed them, and scattered them throughout the land.
8269 : This is why my wounds will never heal. I cannot fly as long as my ssscales are held captive. Not now, not ever.
8270 : Even the slightest flap of my wings sends jolts of pain down my ssspine.
8271 : Circling the mountaintop is all I can bear before I am forced to make landfall. Arriving at the Lightsssland? Beyond question.
8272 : I have searched many of your lifetimesss for even one, but to no avail.
8273 : I have no other avenues to try, and cannot disperse the evil.
8274 : Where could his scales possibly...?
8275 : Darrcuiln...and Morimar, too. And alssso...
8276 : ...You two. Even a caged Opo-opo knows that it cannot reach the pamama tree.
8277 : This was your doing, I assume?
8278 : 'Twas.
8279 : I know not what you plan, but I could have my answer engraved on a ssstone tablet and you would just claim to be illiterate.
8280 : Come on, Sajj'aka. Yer not one to forget the oath ya swore to August--to protect the wildlands.
8281 : Or do you mean to say ya wanted to help when it was convenient for ya, and the rest of us be damned?
8282 : Please, mighty dragon! We need your aid!
8283 : No. Begone.
8284 : But this is the will of the king himself!
8285 : What you would asssk of me cannot be done. August told us to impart one lesson to the people--never again were they to set foot in the wilds.
8286 : What do you think of Sajj'aka's claim? It's relevant. It's preposterous.
8287 : Sssee, Morimar? Even an outsider such as [he/she] knows the tale.
8288 : Do you not see your role as an accomplice in this travesssty?
8289 : What would you know of the truth? Morimar and I were there, while your far ancestors were doubtless still bickering over some petty land dispute.
8290 : In any event, the king had but one wish--that none ever enter the continent.
8291 : But the children of men are foolhardy. Their lives last but an inssstant, and thus their capacity for wisdom is lacking.
8292 : They knew his dying words, yet from then until this very day, they never abandoned their desire to terrorize the jungle.
8293 : The fools are not aware that the World Tree's roots are buried deep within the Serpentine Labyrinth, shutting in the forces of darkness from the outssside world.
8294 : No, not only are they ignorant--they continue to harm the Tree with each breath they take.
8295 : Numberless are the years I spent watching humanity's pernicious deeds from atop this frigid peak.
8296 : I am confident that the king would not have wavered in these dark times. Man is to leave this place.
8297 : Ya sing a tune of gloom and doom, Sajj'aka, but these are desperate times. Who else do ya expect to save the World Tree?
8298 : This isn't a question of men, nor of how long a life ya lead. Doesn't matter one bit.
8299 : If the prince of the deeps comes back, both man and beast, both the mortal and the ageless, will be swallowed up whole.
8300 : Ya know why--because he detests all life. Yer aware of it as much as I am.
8301 : His scythe'll reap all that draws breath.
8302 : You ssspeak truth. A storm threatens to tear us all apart.
8303 : The World Tree's power has begun to fade, and my wingsss will not carry me for more than a few brief moments.
8304 : The Naakualsss have been embroiled in conflict from dawn to dusk since the moment Morimar emerged from that cursed labyrinth, and even they have begun to forget why.
8305 : That's exactly what I'm gettin' at!
8306 : Sajj'aka, not for even a second have I forgotten that August gave me Ortharsyne and said Never again is man to set foot into the wilds.
8307 : But think--why, after all these centuries, would the blade burn bright and point these two kids here?
8308 : I've been trying to say that the whole time! Don't you agree, %?
8309 : What is your opinion? There's some deeper meaning. It's just the winds of chance.
8310 : See? We both think so!
8311 : That is correct, child. Your sojourn was but pure misconception.
8312 : No, I...I refuse to believe that.
8313 : %, you don't either, do you? Because if you do...
8314 : I, too, see a reason behind all this.
8315 : Long ago, when August's dyin' words had begun to fade into legend, Adoulinians set out to recolonize the land.
8316 : You're talking about the Great Expedition.
8317 : Is that how it came to be known? Trust me, there was nothin' great 'bout it.
8318 : August made a five-degree turn in his grave and they all ran howling back to the city with their tails between their legs.
8319 : And what'd they do when they got back? Made some excuse about needin' to respect the dead and erected that huge seal.
8320 : A huge seal?
8321 : What matters is that they made it. Don't worry yerself with the particulars.
8322 : When faced with something they do not know, man has a deep-rooted need to seal it away and never think 'bout it again.
8323 : They cover it, put it away, and pretend that it never existed.
8324 : <Snort> August was right. Some people're stronger than others.
8325 : That's why his first warning came in a dream. He figured that'd be enough.
8326 : But your Ygnas is as thick-skulled as a Velkk.
8327 : So when that didn't work, August took a bit o' the World Tree's power and turned him into a leafkin.
8328 : And the landshivers...are those caused by the founder king, too?
8329 : Would that they were.
8330 : No matter how strong a man is, he can't make the earth tremble.
8331 : No, it's 'cause the World Tree is losin' her strength.
8332 : It's no surprise you'd misunderstand. The warnings are graver now than you'd read in any of yer books.
8333 : First the king gets poofed into a seedling, and now landshivers?
8334 : Surely people would think to stop colonization.
8335 : And in most times, that would have been the case.
8336 : But no, not with Ygnas. Not once has he thought to give in.
8337 : Not only does he remain resolute, but he even took that curse to be a blessing, thinking it'd help him understand the World Tree.
8338 : Help him understand? I don't follow.
8339 : Wait...is that why he said that the curse must never be lifted?
8340 : I'm pretty sure.
8341 : Some people are stronger than others...but perhaps Ygnas is stronger still.
8342 : And not just him. Arciela, %...and all your compatriots who persist in colonizing the land.
8343 : No, I'm not sure that's the case.
8344 : %, do you remember the first time we met?
8345 : It was outside the forest, when a young girl no older than eight went outside the city walls to find some herbs to help her grandfather.
8346 : Do you remember? Tiana. Of course. I've seen lots of little girls...
8347 : %, isn't that a stroke too cruel? How could you forget about Tiana?
8348 : I think that we all are weak. We put on airs to protect those we love.
8349 : For Tiana, it was her grandfather. For my brother, it is the people of Adoulin.
8350 : (And for this princess...)
8351 : (...it is not just the people, but all things that live on the continent.)
8352 : (Would you not say so, %?)
8353 : How do you react? Assent. Dissent.
8354 : %? Why are you nodding?
8355 : (Well, if you say so...)
8356 : %? Is there something wrong?
8357 : To protect somethin' they love, huh? Can't say I understand it...but that may be my age showin'.
8358 : (Like a chocobo being put out to pasture.)
8359 : Shut yer trap! If I wanted yer opinion, I'd've given it to ya!
8360 : (...)
8361 : Yes, that's a good boy.
8362 : Y'know what I think, Sajj'aka? August must be pretty conflicted. That's why he used the sword to call them here.
8363 : ...Conflicted?
8364 : Yup. That's my opinion.
8365 : Times have changed, and new forces are comin' to bear.
8366 : There are so many like Arciela, and like %, workin' for the benefit of Adoulin.
8367 : Is that so...
8368 : I've got an idea of where to find yer scales.
8369 : How...how could you possibly know that?
8370 : Hmph. Ya think all I've been doin' these long years is slingin' my axe around?
8371 : I may not be as spry as I once was, but I can sneak around like the best of 'em!
8372 : Ya got somethin' to say? Come now, out with it.
8373 : (...No. We simply have different perspectives.)
8374 : That's right. Different. Now, uh...where was I? Oh, right.
8375 : Y'know, there's a reason we haven't found those scales yet. And it's not because we're overlookin' somethin'--it's because we aren't searchin' in the right place.
8376 : And where would you suggessst?
8377 : Sometimes you can be pretty dense, Sajj'aka.
8378 : Didn't you just get done saying people aren't nearly as clever as you?
8379 : Bwahaha, nothin' beats playin' around with a fuddy-duddy like yerself! But back to the matter at hand...
8380 : Where are you thinking, Morimar?
8381 : Deep within the recesses of the Naakuals' charges... That's right.
8382 : The Serpentine Labyrinth.
8383 : Why would...?
8384 : Think. That place has been sealed off thanks to the pact they made with August. Some areas haven't been opened up in generations upon generations.
8385 : The pioneers have tried to make inroads there, but've met with little success.
8386 : So if we could find a way in...
8387 : Then there's a chance we can find 'em.
8388 : But it won't be enough just to ask the Naakuals to let you in.
8389 : We would need more than their permission?
8390 : You take a long look at your %.
8391 : They'll need your okay too, Sajj'aka! So says the ritual.
8392 : At lassst, I see why you brought them before me.
8393 : Finally. As I said, August is wandering 'n confused.
8394 : All of us know that stopping colonization won't stem the tide of what's to come.
8395 : The World Tree can't hold out much longer!
8396 : So I got to thinkin'--ya've gotta lead them deep inside the labyrinth, even if it means lettin' colonization go on.
8397 : You can't let them hurt the forest without purpose, right?
8398 : And ya care what happens to this land.
8399 : Ya know why he's kept silent all this time--it was to let them meet with the Naakuals and the leafkin.
8400 : And with you, too, Sajj'aka.
8401 : Even since that Ygnas turned into one of those little green buggers, August hasn't made a single peep, like he did during the Great Expedition.
8402 : No, colonization has proceeded quite smoothly, and the pioneers have breached the reaches of the Serpentine Labyrinth. Isn't that all the proof you need?
8403 : There've been no sacrifices and no saviors. Everythin's just on the edge of boilin' over.
8404 : Do ya disagree? I'm more than willin' to listen.
8405 : ... Morimar, my old friend and battle brother.
8406 : And you, who bears proof of your deeds.
8407 : %...if you and your ilk are indeed this new force Morimar thinks you are, then I shall bessstow upon you my protection, that you may light the way ahead.
8408 : With Sajj'aka's blessin', ya should be able to enter areas of the Serpentine Labyrinth that were once forbidden.
8409 : Ya know yer task--to search for the dragon's scales. Get a move on, before it's too late!
8410 : I'll come with you, %!
8411 : Unfortunately, dear princess, I can't allow ya to.
8412 : Not that I don't appreciate yer valor. Far from it. But yer talents are better used elsewhere.
8413 : Darrcuiln can only protect ya so much--and there are other things ya need to be doin'.
8414 : Like what?
8415 : Look within yerself. Is searchin' for dragon scales the best way ya can help?
8416 : What 'bout Adoulin? Don't they need a shining beacon, given the state Ygnas is in?
8417 : ...You're right. I'm needed in the city.
8418 : %, I know you can do this without me. There are things in Adoulin that only I can handle.
8419 : Among them, gathering information. And I am sure you'll do the same, though in a different way.
8420 : I know searching for those scales will be dangerous, and it may mean your life--but there's no one I would trust more.
8421 : After all...we each have our role to play.
8422 : And Darrcuiln...I know that you talk to % telepathically.
8423 : Could you...could you do the same with me?
8424 : (<Gulp>... So you knew all along.)
8425 : (I will tell you this--there are some things better left unknown.)
8426 : I'm not one to shy away from candles in times of darkness. The blood of Adoulin courses through me--and I am prepared to fight.
8427 : (...I see.)
8428 : Bwahaha, the girl's got a leg up on you, shaggy.
8429 : (Then I shall do what I can.)
8430 : (Anything I tell %, I shall tell you as well. I trust you do not mind, %?)
8431 : Should Darrcuiln speak with Arciela? Yes. She has a right to know. No. I'd rather keep her safe.
8432 : (She is not the type of girl to give in. She will keep pressing until you submit.)
8433 : I'm so glad to hear you agree.
8434 : %, the Serpentine Labyrinth is a tough nut to crack. Ya should head back to Arciela from time to time. I'm sure she'll dig up somethin' that'll help ya.
8435 : Suppose there's not much left for me to say. Keep your nose to the grindstone, but not so much that ya lose sight of what's important.
8436 : Ssso it is as Morimar said. My scales were sealed away in that cursed place.
8437 : I know you can find them all. To think...all those yearsss I wasted searching in the wrong places.
8438 : But remember--even if you find them all, I will not be at full strength, and will not be able to penetrate the Ssserpentine Labyrinth any more than you.
8439 : Hades, my hatred for you grows deeper with each breath I exhale! %, I know you will sssucceed!
8440 : My scales...I can ssscarcely believe they are all here.
8441 : Utterly...utterly amazing!
8442 : I had long resssigned myself to eternal pain, but now I remember what it feels like to be whole.
8443 : It's all fading away...
8444 : The nightmare is over.
8445 : I...I am free. Once more will I be able to sssoar above the clouds, feeling their wet droplets coalesce on my flesh.
8446 : Children of man, you have my thanksss. Now that I am once again whole, I will aid your cause.
8447 : A dragon does not forget his promises.
8448 : Is this...%? Like the one August brought back from Rhazowa?
8449 : You obtain %!
8450 : So what now, Sajj'aka? You feel like humanity isn't as hopeless as you thought?
8451 : My friend, these outsidersss...what did you call them?
8452 : Adventurers. They journey the land for all sorts of purposes. Fame. Fortune. Justice. Wanderlust.
8453 : Here, they fulfill the roles of pioneers.
8454 : They come from the Middle Lands, but they have been all over the world. Some went to...what was it called? Aht Urhgan? Where they served as mercenaries.
8455 : Color me impresssed, Morimar. You have certainly been busy when not under my gaze.
8456 : We talk of August and curses, ancient empires and forgotten kingdoms...but what Vana'diel is today, it is because of young men and women like %.
8457 : An age of adventure...
8458 : Ssspeaking of powers long forgotten, back in those olden times, there were three forces that made all this possible.
8459 : The savage yet noble hero, King August.
8460 : The twinned World Tree, which watches over all life.
8461 : And you, Sajj'aka. A holy dragon whose light shines like the freshly woken sun.
8462 : I thought...I thought all had been lossst.
8463 : We worked as hard as we could, yet it was all we could do to ssseal away Hades.
8464 : And now, with those forces in a precipitousss decline, I thought there was no way to save this land.
8465 : ...
8466 : Up until this moment, I had taken these phenomena to herald the beginning of the end.
8467 : I thought myself irreparably shattered, yet now my woundsss are mended. This is all thanks to you.
8468 : With this, you should be able to ressstore the World Tree.
8469 : Two of the three are ready to be brought to bear. Now what about August, whose spirit is held hostage in the Serpentine Labyrinth?
8470 : If we only had sssomething that could compare to his valor...
8471 : We do.
8472 : %, you have traveled through Vana'diel. There is a certain song that you perhaps may have heard of.
8473 : It shelters us in times of need.
8474 : A mere song?
8475 : Yes. This song has been passed down in Adoulin from generation to generation, and is said to have come from the Goddess herself.
8476 : Though storms may brew And threaten the land, There is one shining star That shall help us to stand.
8477 : It remains resolute Before man, before beast, And brings with it a song, A bright hope when fortune has ceased.
8478 : This ally is just, Its eyes raised to the sky, Protecting us from our foes-- A blessing from on high.
8479 : It has been around longer than Adoulin, and some scholars assert that it was originally sung in a tongue not known to the people of Vana'diel.
8480 : And the section we know is but one part of a greater whole.
8481 : Our interpretation may be wrong, but nonetheless, it is a beacon that guides Adoulinians in dark times.
8482 : The Goddess of the Dawn has served as our eternal protector, and we cannot help but think these words spilled forth from her lips.
8483 : Hearing this song now, I feel like all hope is not lost. That tomorrow will be a brighter day.
8484 : As Sajj'aka said, maybe we do not have the three forces that sealed Hades away so long ago...but we have something now that they did not.
8485 : Just like a holy dragon rising valiantly from the peaks... Just like a young tree stretching defiantly towards the heavens...
8486 : We have a new power, standing right by our side.
8487 : So the light of dawn comes from the east, hmm?
8488 : And this new power can cleanse evil, expel monstrositiesss, and conquer the darkness...
8489 : Sajj'aka, this sapling you have given us--what are we to do with it?
8490 : When August recovered the sssapling from Rhazowa and brought it here, he planted it in one of the most sacred areas of Ulbuka.
8491 : But such an area would have long since fallen to the choking miasssmas of the Serpentine Labyrinth.
8492 : Were you able to affix it to the roots of the exisssting World Tree, you may be able to bring it back to life...but I have not the faintest notion of how.
8493 : Not at all?
8494 : Unfortunately. But do not fret, young one. Should you desssire to aid the World Tree, all you need do is ask it.
8495 : Ask the World Tree? How would we go about doing that?
8496 : Wait...could you possibly mean...?
8497 : I see you are ssstarting to realize at last.
8498 : Your first order of business is to restore the World Tree. That is the only way to bolssster Ulbuka against the evil within.
8499 : A snow-dusted crag blocks your path.
8500 : There is an opening in the crag just large enough for you to squeeze through.
8501 : Your %'s power returns, and it transforms into %.
8502 : Should we have been invited to this gathering?
8503 : Arciela and %! We've been waitin' fer ya.
8504 : But before we get started, I owe ya an apology.
8505 : An apology? For what?
8506 : For the whole Hades deal. It was that bastard this whole time.
8507 : I shoulda known.
8508 : But if you know about him now, then does that mean...?
8509 : Yeah. I found out while ya were gone.
8510 : While dealin' with the whole Melvien incident in Leafallia, the World Tree brought forth vivid images in my mind. I can still feel 'em.
8511 : And all this time, I had ignored what was right in front of me. Curse the lotta 'em!
8512 : My mind blanked out. Not fer a second, but fer minutes. Ta think...
8513 : Sajj'aka regained his former strength and the World Tree came back ta life. And then Hades...
8514 : That cursed fool came back too! I'd sooner rake my hands o'er hot coals than let it happen, but it was too late!
8515 : But our problems don't stop there. No, I'm here because--
8516 : Of the Xol Triumvirate.
8517 : Then I can spare ya the long explanation, and content myself that you're aware of the disaster they bring about by servin' their foul master.
8518 : The easssterly winds have shifted, young ones, heralding the revival of his malicious decadence.
8519 : Calling it an ill portent would make mockery of the sssacrifices August and his generals made...that we all made.
8520 : But we have yet to bear witness to breaches in the jungle's integrity itself, indicating that neither Hades nor his ssservants have crested in power.
8521 : But Sajj'aka, things have already begun to--
8522 : No, Princesss. They have not.
8523 : If they were to fully awaken, the land would split in twain, choking tendrils dragging pioneers into a bottomless crevasse. No, what you see now is merely a foreshadowing of what is to come.
8524 : But we're not exactly sittin' pretty here, either.
8525 : You speak truthfully.
8526 : That's the reason why we've come. To seek your wisdom and experience against your old foes.
8527 : (...)
8528 : Balamor... That name is not familiar to me. And you believe he is the most recent incarnation of the undying horde'sss leader.
8529 : Let's leave that one alone for now.
8530 : Just forget about him?
8531 : If what ya said is true, he'll probably be content to sit on the sidelines and let it all play out as long as we don't make any sudden moves.
8532 : He'll look out from his little perch, laughin' at how our actions cause the stage to revolve.
8533 : He thinks we're puppets, dancing around fer his own pleasure...and the fewer immediate threats we've gotta deal with, the better.
8534 : And what's this about a Grand Guignol? Idiot's already writing his script when the characters have their own ideas how things'll shake out!
8535 : We've got two left to deal with, assumin' they're the same as they were then. The first, Dhokmak the Brash Xol, he of the toxic miasma.
8536 : Then there's the one who commands forked lightning and blades of wind, Ashrakk, the Duskbrood Xol.
8537 : And if yer rumors are true, Princess, then that's exactly who we're dealin' with.
8538 : But, then again, now that we're dealin' with this Balamor figure...I wouldn't bet my axe on it.
8539 : Grah! Does it even matter in the end? We've gotta put them outta their misery regardless of whether they're the fiends I remember.
8540 : I'd hoped it was my time to pass on quietly into the night, but as long as they're here, ya've got me by yer side.
8541 : And I shall lend my aid as well. Now that I have recovered--
8542 : Not you, Sajj'aka. Not yet.
8543 : We might've gotten yer scales back and ditched that ol' curse, but yer in no condition to go sharpenin' your talons on those two.
8544 : Ya gotta get stronger, old friend. Hades is comin' back, and we'll need ya then more'n now.
8545 : You were there; that unholy battleground where our comrades...
8546 : Leave the triumvirate to us and get yerself ready.
8547 : Perhaps that is for the best. Your hands have proven capable more than once.
8548 : Okay, time to fly!
8549 : How do you respond? Just where are we going? Fly?
8550 : Oho, I guess I left that little detail out.
8551 : Walk doesn't sound as dramatic. But we've got to get there somehow. Where, you ask?
8552 : Leafallia--where else? The best way to understand the forest is to hear it from the queen herself.
8553 : Forgive me for saying this, %, but your tendency to be one step behind seems to be literal as well as figurative.
8554 : Where to begin...
8555 : Why start with more ephemeral topicsss when we can focus on someone close to our hearts: Morimar.
8556 : But if we take things out of order then their heads will spin so fast they'll go tumbling right off the cliff.
8557 : I suppose that means I must lead you toward a most uncomfortable truth.
8558 : You cannot defeat Hades as things stand, and I need you to carefully listen to the reason.
8559 : In his quest to keep himself from dissipating into nothingness, Hades engraved a piece of himself onto the souls of each member of the Xol Triumvirate.
8560 : How would he go about doing that?
8561 : It is not as peculiar a technique as you might surmise.
8562 : Why, it is the same technique as that used by the key to the founder king's grave, passed on from each generation of the Order of Adoulin to the next.
8563 : A key, Princess, whose passing you once witnessed.
8564 : That key, engraved with the soul of Ygnas himself, was also once handed over to % temporarily.
8565 : You mean...
8566 : The one and same. Hades used a similar ritual to create blood sigils on the spirits of his three most trusted underlings.
8567 : Blood sigils?
8568 : Most sinister, no? But as long as they exist, you cannot vanquish Hades.
8569 : I don't understand.
8570 : The sigils are inexorably intertwined not just with the triumvirate...
8571 : But with Hades' soul itself.
8572 : <Gulp>
8573 : These sigils not only provide entry to the turris, but they are an armor stronger than the thickest mythril.
8574 : The Xol Triumvirate are inscribed with these profane marks.
8575 : Any harm inflicted upon Hades mars instead the flesh of those three abominations.
8576 : How do you respond? What does that mean? Then our attacks against him...
8577 : Exactly what it sounds like. Wounds do not affect him.
8578 : An entire retinue could slice and hack at him for days, but you may as well assault the sea with a saber.
8579 : ...Did not work, as you have doubtlessly noticed. His flesh is impervious, his organs unblemished.
8580 : But those sigils serve another purpose--they are symbols of the triumvirate's total fealty.
8581 : How could they be anything less? Hades has engraved himself upon their very souls.
8582 : Teodor, why do you know all this? Please, tell me!
8583 : That which I thought I had unraveled has come twisting back to me.
8584 : Come back to you?
8585 : No, you can't mean--!
8586 : I do. It prevents me from heading toward Hades' domain.
8587 : As I said, they are symbols of absolute fealty...
8588 : As it was then...
8589 : His blood sigil takes hold of me once more.
8590 : No!
8591 : Sssurely you understand now, Princess.
8592 : Though he once ssserved under the monster, he is now one of the seven...the Undying Naakual.
8593 : In the flesh.
8594 : Teodor...a Naakual!?
8595 : Yes.
8596 : Sajj'aka and Morimar have long protected Ulbuka from that which sought to engulf it...and so, too, have I.
8597 : In the age of the founder king, I had originally pledged my life to Hades, but came to embrace August and all he stood for.
8598 : And now, I stand before you.
8599 : When Morimar bid you flee from the turris, he was not acting irrationally. Far from it.
8600 : I am the reason for his actions.
8601 : But how? Why!?
8602 : Because the blood sigil prevented me from laying siege myself.
8603 : No...
8604 : When I caught wind that he was making haste for the turris, I cut him off--and revealed the truth.
8605 : Forgive my squawking like a colibri repeating the same phrase thrice over, but Hades cannot be vanquished as long as the sigils are manifest.
8606 : How can you call something a battle when the enemy's victory is already assured?
8607 : I was naught but honest. Had you fought alongside him in that struggle, all of you would have been consumed.
8608 : And confronted face-to-face, engaged with death itself, escape would have been utterly impossible.
8609 : Someone had to stay there and confront him, alone, so that the rest would survive.
8610 : In a word, I sentenced him to death. I confided that the only way for you to survive was for him to sacrifice himself.
8611 : And do you know how he replied?
8612 : I've got no problem givin' up my life if it means protectin' those dear ta me.
8613 : How fitting.
8614 : (Morimar...why? Why did you have to suffer alone?)
8615 : Oh, no...
8616 : You surely understand the implications, having toppled both Ashrakk and Dhokmak.
8617 : To them, the marks are a blessing, but to me...a curse.
8618 : And Hades will not go quietly into the night as long as any of the marks survive.
8619 : There is only one way. You must wrest my mark from me.
8620 : ...In the same way as the hallowed August did so many centuries ago.
8621 : Yet here is not a place for bloodshed. We must go somewhere more appropriate.
8622 : Here.
8623 : I'll await you in Rala Waterways...in the Watergarden Coliseum.
8624 : And Princess--I forbid you from taking part.
8625 : For the mark to be extinguished, I must challenge % with the utmost rancor.
8626 : I understand.
8627 : But I have one request. Though I cannot take part, I would like to be present--as one of August's heirs.
8628 : I fear your bravery outstrips your wisdom here, Arciela. You may not like what you see.
8629 : I won't shy away from my people's future.
8630 : Spoken like a true leader. When next I see you, it will be on the field of battle.
8631 : Teodor had always struck me as being more than he let on...
8632 : But never would I have imagined he lived during the time of the founder king.
8633 : How do you respond? You knew each other? I thought he was a libertine, myself.
8634 : In a word, yes. I had been lost in thought in the library, when he gave me a kind word and an encouraging nod. Ever since then, he's always been there to listen to my troubles.
8635 : It was he who suggested that I register at the Pioneers' Coalition so I could leave for the jungle more...formally.
8636 : He was almost...mystical. Yet he was very down-to-earth and accepted me for all my flaws.
8637 : Hehe, isn't that a little mean?
8638 : But given that pioneers always spread rumors about him drowning in drink and gambling at the Mummers' Coalition, I can't fault you for thinking that.
8639 : If you asssk me, his blending in with the citizens of Adoulin was too much of a risk.
8640 : Right as I would forget about him, he would come bounding up the mountain with fanciful tales of the sights he saw and people he met. A youngling again, he ssseemed to be, as if the centuries of his life touched him not.
8641 : Lest you be fooled, %, he is unlike any of the other Naakuals you have faced. Never let your guard down for an inssstant.
8642 : And if you cannot even best the man in black, rest assured that Hades would grind your bonesss into dust and come for your eastern homeland. So fight with both vim and vigor.
8643 : He expects no less of you. Nor do I. You have proven your mettle before, and a warrior such as he--who brought the founder king to a standstill--will show you no quarter.
8644 : Remove the curse the dread lord has placed upon him.
8645 : Go. Death waits for no man.
8646 : %...Teodor tells me you have besssted him.
8647 : Last he came, he ssspoke of you in the most glowing of terms.
8648 : It's been ages, he opined, since he fought with all his might.
8649 : You should have heard him prattling on like a child receiving a new toy on Ssstarlight.
8650 : Yet I must confesss I envy his free spirit...
8651 : Enough. You did not come to hear me wax poetic about timesss gone by.
8652 : You impress me more each time we meet. None other has had the resolve to vanquish each of the seven Naakuals.
8653 : You have resided in Adoulin for sssome time now.
8654 : I know what the city's leaders tell all who disembark on Ulbukan soil.
8655 : The Naakuals are thwarting the pioneers' best efforts...and that your job is to remove anything that stands in the way of progresss.
8656 : You may deny it, but your face speaks the truth.
8657 : In a twisted way, those words were prophetic, for your overcoming of the seventh Naakual will prove critical in sssaving this land.
8658 : I would have expected nothing less of you.
8659 : Those who represent the will of the founder king are destined to sssubjugate the Naakuals.
8660 : There is a reason I am keenly aware of that fact...for it was I who started that superstition within the city.
8661 : But lest you think I dessscended upon Jorius Yett and issued an edict from on high, in fact I planted seeds of the truth within their minds.
8662 : Humanity has always intrigued me. Thoughts buried in your deepest recesses always find a way to sssurface as words.
8663 : Think back. There exist seven Naakuals in Adoulin's collective conscious, but only six had ever been ssseen. Did you not find that to be a bit queer?
8664 : Seven locales, but only six Naakuals?
8665 : Why would people hold such legendsss close to heart when their experiences taught them otherwise?
8666 : All the more amusing when the seventh was in their faces the entire time.
8667 : You have thwarted the Naakuals, as did August before you.
8668 : You have earned the trussst of not only those noble beings, but of the leafkin as well.
8669 : To sssay nothing of the faith I place in you.
8670 : The time is nigh. Go forth with the confidence I know you have.
8671 : You can succeed where August did not.
8672 : Your audacity intrigues me, knight. Only the noble and the foolhardy possess the gumption to face an entire regiment with naught but the armor on their backs.
8673 : Why withdraw your forces, knave? Dare you doubt the capabilities of your better?
8674 : Ah, how quickly the veil breaks down. You are a fool to the bitter end.
8675 : I offer myself on a silver platter, and all you concern yourself with is the why.
8676 : ...
8677 : Handed over key item: %.
8678 : Your % rings out across the land, somehow resonating with the % and causing it to evolve.
8679 : The % has reclaimed its lost power, and your % silently crumbles to dust.
8680 : The % is bestowed with an incredible amount of runic energy, causing it to take on a more puissant form.
8681 : The % has reached the pinnacle of its evolution.
8682 : Your % decomposes instantly and is carried by the winds to the ends of Vana'diel.
8683 : You feel an ever-so-faint sense that a rune with [frigid/bright/transient] properties lies nearby.
8684 : You scribbled down some information regarding %.
8685 : You have obtained new information regarding your %.
8686 : Strange visions flood into your mind!
8687 : Fragments of shattered memories wedge themselves into your skull.
8688 : Oh, wise Sajj'aka... We have something to show you regarding Siren's disappearance.
8689 : %, if you would... Please show His Eminence the item you found in %.
8690 : You show Sajj'aka the %.
8691 : %? I have not heard of such a place. Let me sssee...
8692 : Hmm... Yesss, I can sense Siren's presence emanating from this bell...
8693 : However, she seems to have lost her power and is immersed in a deep ssslumber.
8694 : A deep slumber?
8695 : So if she were to regain her power, she would wake up eventually!?
8696 : Do not be so hasssty, Princess. Even with my great wisdom, I am uncertain how to go about such a matter...
8697 : However, it is clear that we must focusss on how to restore her power before we can proceed any further.
8698 : Yes, I suppose you are right.
8699 : Although, how can we do that, I wonder...
8700 : What will you ask about? The lifestream. Sweets. %. %.
8701 : Hm? S-sweets, you say?
8702 : They'd make me feel better, but I'm not so sure about this particular situation...
8703 : H-hey! Where did you get that!?
8704 : That has nothing to do with Siren!
8705 : Is that... Is that a leaf from my brother?
8706 : I don't think that has anything to do with Siren...
8707 : The lifestream... In other words, you're saying that if we can borrow the power of ergon loci, we might be able to use it to restore Siren's power...
8708 : And if Siren regains her power and is able to wake up...
8709 : Ah!
8710 : I forgot something important!
8711 : If Siren wakes up, do you think she'll even listen to what we have to say?
8712 : I mean, she is a powerful being who is able to control all of nature...
8713 : Anything to say? The Communion. Talk about sweets. %. %.
8714 : I highly doubt offering Siren sweets will convince her to help us.
8715 : It's not like they'd convince me to listen to you either!
8716 : H-hey, I mean it!
8717 : This is no time for jokes, %. Try to be serious for a change.
8718 : %, I don't think that's going to get us anywhere.
8719 : The Communion!
8720 : That reminds me of something Lhaiso once said...
8721 : Long ago, distinguished geomancers used the Communion to speak with nature and prime avatars...
8722 : If so, we could ask either Lhaiso or Ikhi for help...
8723 : The Communion... A Communion is a pact with nature.
8724 : What's that, Ygnas? A Communion is a pact with nature?
