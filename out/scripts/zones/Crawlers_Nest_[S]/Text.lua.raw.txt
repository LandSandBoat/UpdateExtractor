20 : Greetings. I am  of the Federation of Windurst.
21 : Greetings. I am , Campaign Arbiter for the Allied Forces.
22 : What can I help you with? Nothing. Performance assessment. New Allied Tags. Temporary items. Union registration. Teleportation. Information on the Allied Campaign.
23 : What would you like to know? Nothing. I'm sorry. About performance assessment. About Allied Tags. About temporary items. About Unions.
24 : I am sorry, but at this time, I cannot be of any assistance in that area.
25 : Understood. I shall now judge your performance and award the proper remuneration.
26 : Ah, I'm sorry to inform you that your performance has not earned you any compensation.
27 : Understood. I shall prepare a new set of tags for you now.
28 : You've already undergone an evaluation for this battle, or had you forgotten? As much as I'd like to, I'm forbidden from providing you with a new set of Allied Taegs until the next battle begins.
29 : Anyone wearing Allied Tags while participating in a campaign battle will be judged on their overall performance.
30 : Soldiers will be evaluated not only on their fighting skills, but also on how much they contribute to the efforts of their allies through means such as healing and enhancing.
31 : However, beware that if you leave the area before being assessed, you will be deemed a deserter and will forfeit all rewards earned that day.
32 : Also, while there are no immediate penalties for being knocked out, falling in battle will significantly lower the score given to you.
33 : When you are ready to receive compensation for your work on the field, return to me and I shall assess your performance and provide you with your payment.
34 : Allied Tags are a special type of identification given to all participants of Allied Campaign battles.
35 : There are benefits, as well as drawbacks, to wearing the tags. One of the benefits is that in the case you are knocked out on the battlefield, you will not lose any experience points.
36 : However, some of the drawbacks include the inability to improve skills and earn experience points for individual kills, as well as the right to loot fallen enemies.
37 : Temporary items can be purchased in exchange for Allied Notes.
38 : There are several different varieties of items, but they all have one thing in common--they can only be used on the battlefield they were issued.
39 : It is highly recommended that you first survey a battle's conditions and then select the supplies that you believe will benefit you most.
40 : Please remember that all temporary items you carry on your person will be confiscated in the event that you leave the area.
41 : You can only purchase temporary items if your nation of allegiance is commanding the campaign.
42 : That is all.
43 : I will require a teleportation fee of # Allied Note[/s]. I see you currently possess #.
44 : Complete transaction and return to capital? Yes. No.
45 : Understood. Good work today, %.
46 : The gate is locked.
47 : You cannot perform that action now.
48 : I cannot help you now. I have other orders to carry out.
49 : Don't hurt poor Geltpix! Geltpix's just a merchant from Boodlix's Emporium in Jeuno. Kingdom vendors don't like gil, but Boodlix knows true value of new money.
50 : Blingbrix good Gobbie from Boodlix's! Boodlix's Emporium help fighting fighters and maging mages. Gil okay, okay?

54 : Might you be a student of the same field as I? If that is the case, I might be able to provide you with the proper grimoires...at a price, of course.
55 : Spondulix comes all the way from Boodlix's Emporium to help Tarutaru and Mithra. I can help you, too! You have gil, no?
56 : The campaign battle in this area has already come to a close. I suggest you return to the barracks and rest up for the next operation.
57 : Let me show you the list of items currently available to you.

67 : Your reputation within the Allied Campaign has risen by #!

69 : Oh ho! Keen to join a Union, are we? Very well. Listen up and I shall tell you all you need to know.
70 : In order to better coordinate Allied efforts against the beastman menace, we have instituted a system of ad hoc tactical regiments called Unions. With five units to a battlefield, union registration is open to any proven soldier in possession of Allied Tags.
71 : In return for their aid in advancing the war effort, union registrants will be eligible to earn a share of the spoils of war.
72 : Needless to say, the choicest rewards will be reserved for those unions which make the greatest contributions in combat. Prove your mettle on the field of battle, and you will earn glory for your union, as well as a sizable bounty of your own.
73 : Be forewarned that your commitment to your union comes first and foremost. In the aftermath of battle, you will not be permitted to reap rewards from your individual exploits until your union has distributed its plunder.
74 : Caution! If a union member joins or leaves an existing party, that party's treasure pool will be distributed automatically and immediately.
75 : Register for a union? Yes. No.
76 : [Transfer/Resign] from your current union? Yes. No.

236 : Hey, you're in the way. We fortifyin' this here wall to withstand the beastmen's siege turrets. So how's about just gettin' outta here before you get hurt.
237 : Unless you're willin' to wipe that helpless look off your face and lend us a hand. That'd be a different story.
238 : Assist with the fortifications? Show them how it's done! Refuse to help. Ask for an explanation.
239 : Alright! That's the spirit! Let's get a move on, then.
240 : Hmph, I figured as much by lookin' at you. Beat it, then. This is no place for tourists.
241 : Like I said, in preparation for an enemy assault, we're workin' to fortify these defensive barriers. If you're willin', I'd like to place you in charge of managin' these here craftsmen as they go about it.
242 : To be more precise, once you get to each craftsman's position, you have to tell 'em exactly what I'm about to tell you. Namely, what type of crystal they need to be usin'. That's all there is to it.
243 : The young Elvaan wearin' the red hat is a blacksmith. Make sure he's using fire crystals.
244 : The adorable little Tarutaru with the blonde braids is laying plaster. Gonna have to get her on some ice crystals.
245 : The Hume lady is a stonemason, and a darn good one. She's gonna be needin' wind crystals.
246 : That old coot of an Elvaan with the huge axe strapped across his back is a carpenter. Famous 'round these parts. Make sure you get him workin' with earth crystals.
247 : May not look it, but the Mithra with the black kerchief wrapped 'round her noggin is an architect. She's gonna need her lightning crystals.
248 : That sprat of a Tarutaru wearin' the blue getup's a handy lil' plumber. Surin' he'll be wantin' his water crystals, no doubt.
249 : The good-looking fella in all white does scaffoldin'. Young Hume lad. See to it he's usin' light crystals.
250 : The lady Elvaan's a painter. Handles a brush like nobody I never seen. Need dark crystals in that line of work. And that's it.
251 : Ahhh, one more thing. If you're too late issuin' your orders, they're liable to up and leave their posts. So be right, and be quick.
252 : Choose a crystal! Fire crystal. Ice crystal. Wind crystal. Earth crystal. Lightning crystal. Water crystal. Light crystal. Dark crystal. Plumb give up.
253 : Hey now, you're runnin' this here operation! You can't just quit! There's no quitting in war!
254 : Wow... You sure botched that job. All them wrong orders threw the craftsmen off kilter. They're demandin' a new foreman.
255 : Well, the good news is you're gettin' your orders right. The bad news is that you're takin' your sweet time doing it. We'll never be ready for the Beastmen at this rate.
256 : Come on, now! You even want to win this war!? The craftsmen are startin' to strike thanks to your incompetence!

261 : Ah, you must be %. We've been expecting you.
262 : The delivery took you # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
263 : The delivery took you # [minute/minutes] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
264 : While you were dawdling your way here, a separate shipment of construction materials was delivered to us. We shan't be requiring anymore.
265 : I commend you on your expeditiousness. Thanks to you, the construction work on our provision storehouse here can proceed as planned.
266 : So you have something to aspire to, the quickest delivery thus far was made by %. That indefatigable soldier traversed the same course as you in just # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time).
267 : You're the current quickest delivery record holder, with a lightning-fast time of # [hour/hours] (# [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] Earth time). But that's no excuse to slack off, you hear?
268 : Time elapsed: # [hour/hours] (Vana'diel time) # [minute/minutes] and # [second/seconds] (Earth time)
269 : You find nothing out of the ordinary.
270 : A shiver runs down your spine...
271 : Perhaps you should first attend to more pressing matters...
272 : Something tells you that you should wait a moment and try again.
273 : I am far too busy to speak with you now. Perhaps I'll have a little time later.
274 : Good show on your last operation. Now go make an official report to Sir Rasdinice.
275 : Good work on that last operation. Now report back to First Centurion Hieronymus before he has your hide!
276 : Nice job on your last operation. Now don't forget to report back to Emhi Tchaoryo!
277 : It seems that you were not successful in your last operation. But do not let one small failure hang heavy on your soul. Report to Sir Rasdinice and put this all behind you.
278 : Weren't so lucky during that last operation, were you? Well, don't worry about it too much. Report to First Centurion Hieronymus and get some rest, soldier.
279 : Hmmm... Didn't do so well on that last operation, did you? I know it's hard, but it's better if you're up-front about these things. If you know what's good for you, you'll hurry down and report to Emhi Tchaoryo before the major finds out first.
280 : Make haste, %. Sir Rasdinice awaits your report!
281 : What are you waiting for, %? Report to First Centurion Hieronymus on the double!
282 : Why are you wasting your time chatting with me? Shouldn't you be reporting to Emhi Tchaoryo?
283 : Good work, soldier. [The Kingdom/The Republic/The Federation] thanks you for your cooperation.
284 : I am charged with the provisioning of supplies for our troops out on the battlefield. I can issue you temporary items in exchange for Allied Notes.
285 : Select a temporary item. (Price) Nothing at this time. Browse another page. %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) %...(#) Next page. Previous page.

287 : Browse which page? Never mind. Page 1. Page 2. Page 3. Page 4.
288 : It appears you're already in possession of one. I'm sorry, but we can only afford to issue supplies to those who are most in need.
289 : I'm sorry, but we're fresh out of stock for that item.
290 : You must attain a higher rank if you wish to be issued %.
291 : Is there anything else you require?
292 : Let the Blade of the Conqueror once again bring glory to the Kingdom!
293 : Gwahahaha! Let me cool you off a little before I send you to hell!
294 : Father! Lend me your strength!
295 : For the king!
296 : My spear is lightning...and your scream shall be the thunder which follows my mighty strike!
297 : Ha hah! Your arrows cannot pierce the iron will of a true knight!
298 : This arrow to your heart shall be Altana's final judgment.
299 : Shogyo Mujo! Zesho Meppo! Shometsu Metsui! Jakumetsu Iraku!
300 : There is no escape...save death!
301 : Altana! Let your divine light guide us to victory!
302 : You barbarians will regret the day you set foot on Bastokan soil!
303 : Ryaaaaaaaaah!
304 : Men! Do not fear the enemy! It is our blades they shall fear!
305 : A swift end is the only mercy you will receive from me, fiends!
306 : Watch carefully, because this is the last thing you'll ever see in this life!
307 : I never liked fighting on land... Now, give me a well armed battleship on the open sea, and I'll have those turtlebacks running for their lives!
308 : A soldier always comes prepared! Hehehehe!
309 : To your seats, boys! The show is about to begin!
310 : Ahahahaha! My hand slipped!
311 : This is your last chance. Throw down your weapons and your life will be spared. If you refuse...
312 : The gates to the underworld have opened! I'll see you on the other side...or not! Wahahahahah!
313 : There is nothing more magnificent than the dance of flames on the battlefield!
314 : <Phew!> I think I've had enough of this volume!
315 : Guttler: Guttler thirsty! Guttler want blood! More blood!
316 : Time to go to work!
317 : Invincible! Indestructible! Indubitable! The age of the Cardians is upon us!
318 : You, over there. No, wait! You're supposed to be on that side! Hold on, which one were you again? Arrrghhh!
319 : <Snorrre>... Is that the best you can do?
320 : Petty beastman hordes are nothing compared to giant wildebeests of homeland! I swat you all down like fruit flies!
321 : <Yawn>... Um... Holy light...show the way...?
322 : The protection of the throne comes before all else. Only by direct order of the royaulais will I wield my blade on the battlefield. Such is the duty of the Royal Guards.
323 : Hah hah hah! The ringing of steel upon steel! The dripping stench of the battlefield! What could be better than war? The nobles can have their balls, I'll do my dance on the front lines!
324 : How dare a baseborn peasant raise [his/her] voice to a noble knight!? Begone, before I strike you down myself!
325 : The Kingdom's defeat at Jugner still stings. To avenge the souls of those lost on that fateful day, we must join hands and take up arms as one.
326 : Not once in the four hundred years since the dawn of the Royal Knights has the Kingdom found itself in such peril. Let us take up our pikes and stand our ground to ensure another four centuries of prosperity!
327 : It is often in times of strife that a man's true nature is revealed. Will you stand tall in the face of fear, or run and cower in the wake of your mother's dress?
328 : While our holy doctrines specifically prohibit the taking of another life, you need not hesitate on the battlefield. The Church has branded the beastmen enemies of Altana. The purification must begin! It is the will of the Goddess!!!
329 : After years of training in the Far East, I return only to find my nation burning at the hands of the infernal beastman hordes. The heathens shall pay dearly... My work has only just begun.
330 : You have the look of a fine warrior. It is a pity you are not one of my Crimson Wolves.
331 : The eyes of the Goddess are ever upon us. We must remain steadfast against the evils from without, as well as those from within.
332 : The Republic was formed with the blood and sweat of the people. The flames of freedom must continue to light our furnaces of strength. The waters of civilization must continue to turn our wheels of ingenuity!
333 : Turtle sleeps in a rocky den 'Cause he's not a citizen Strike him down with sword and stave Stick a blue flag in his grave
334 : We may have the upper hand in technology and munitions, but the enemy's advantage lies in their sheer numbers. The Allied Campaign will not win in a day, soldier. Make every bullet count.
335 : The Metalworks' strategies are too timid for my taste. The beastmen are nothing but dominoes, waiting to be toppled. A swift, aggressive assault is the only way to victory.
336 : Move along, soldier. I have nothing to say to you.
337 : Halt! If you're not one of the Fourth, then get your sorry tail over to the recruitment office on the double! And if you are one of us, then what the hell are you doing here talking to me!? Get back on the battlefield! About...FACE!
338 : ...Heavy infantry, five columns of 200... Two 100-knight regiments... Enemy force casualties estimated at 5,000... Oh, I apologize, soldier. I've spent the past few nights preparing for a joint operation with San d'Oria's Royal Knights.
339 : You look like you've seen better days, soldier. Let me guess, it's the war that's bringing you down. What you need is a little music in your life!
340 : If it weren't for the Galkan heavy infantry, this nation wouldn't last a month against the turtlebacks. And what thanks do we get? A handful of stale army biscuits!
341 : Have you ever stopped to ponder what that comet might truly portend? I'd like to believe it is a message of hope--that soon this age of darkness will come to a close...
342 : Oh, whatever has become of my sweet Windurst? Rabble running through the streets, streets overrun with rabble! Why are you even speaking to me!? Does the title Master Caster no longer garner even an onz of respect!?
343 : Ah, the Fates have brought you to Gariri the Magnificent! Why am I thus called, you ask? Why, because only I was magnificent enough to decryptify those mysteriously marvelous Near Eastern tomes and open a window to...the Other Side!
344 : We all wear masks because deep down inside we are nothing but beasts. The question I ask you is, to which do you submit--the mask, or the beast?
345 : (Guttler! I told you to keep qui--) Ahahahah... Don't mind me, I was just...uh...keeping myself company! (Shhh! If you open your mouth one more ti--) Ahahaha... Uh, were you still there?
346 : If only the Parliament of Patriarchs would loosen the strings on their purses a little more, I would be outside right now roasting up a couple birdmen to snack on!
347 : Have fun while you can, filthy mercenary, because before long you'll be back on the streets where you belong--replaced by a quiet, obedient army of Cardians!
348 : Normally, it is my duty to protect the patriarchs of parliament, but with the fate of Windurst in doubt, I'm forced to lead my loyal pets to the front lines.
349 : Do you like the headpiece? I made it from my firrrst victim. I wear it to let everrryone know what happens when they cross Mikhe Aryohcha!
350 : Back in my home, Ulbuka, I hear rumors of great riches in eastern lands. But now I am here, and where are riches? I see nothing but Tarus! Ahahahaha!
351 : <Yaaawn>... Mastering these Near Eastern magics can be quite taxing. If I had a choice, I'd rather be back in bed, relaxing...
352 : I saved this one especially for you!
353 : Hiiiiii-yah!
354 : My dear pupil, Dalzakk. You still have much to learn...
355 : Witness the true embodiment of my sorrow.
356 : Heh heh heh!
357 : <Giggle>...
358 : Wheheheheh! You thirsty, Kopeh?
359 : Come, Kilhwch! We must strike down the evil which stands before us!
360 : My brothers and sisters! Raise your blades for justice!
361 : Kilhwch! Silence those fiends!
362 : To your feet, Kilhwch!
363 : Lady Ulla. We must retreat.
364 : How dare you!
365 : The raven shalt spare nary a tear for thy demise.
366 : Watch! And see how a real mercenary earrrns her wage!
367 : Leave me be. The verge of battle is no time for words.
368 : Fear not. My fists will guide us to victory.
369 : My daughter awaits her father at home. I will permit no Beastman to delay my return.
370 : Beyond this point lies the sealed royal tomb of King Ranperre. Tell me, %, do you believe the legends?
371 : The Orc war machine draws near. We must brace ourselves for battle.
372 : In former times, this island was inhabited by a ferocious tribe of vikings. It is said they braved vast expanses of open sea to arrive here. Romantic, don't you think?
373 : Surely you have seen the tigers that roam these downs. They were brought from the northern continent by the Orcs themselves. They are highly prized for their luxurious pelts, though their bloodlust makes them formidable game.
374 : The brotherhood of this place once welcomed me long ago. I pray that the years have been kind to them.
375 : The Gold Musketeers of the Republican Army are marshalled by young woman. Such talk is sure to inspire my daughter.
376 : Bastok was forced to abandon the Palborough Mines following a Beastman invasion. How an army such as the Republic's could permit such an affront baffles me to no end.
377 : The village elder in La Vaule told me of the so-called wyrm deity of Grauberg. Of course, I am sure it is nothing more than folktales. Still, my curiosity is piqued...
378 : Strange... I am certain the vegetation of this area is different from when I last visited. Surely I would not have allowed myself to forget such beautiful flowers.
379 : Such devasation... Even the resilient Goobbue were not able to survive. I wonder if this place shall ever be restored to its former glory...
380 : History tells us that it was in the year 381 that San d'Oria's iron-tempered  King Lanfeaur R d'Oraguille came these lands to strike a peace with the Quadav. Whatever happened to the bond that was formed...?
381 : I have seen here two twins who between them share a power for magic the likes of which I have never seen. This is indeed a strange nation.
382 : Unfortunate... I had always wished to gaze upon the fabled magic towers of West Sarutabaruta with my own eyes. Yet I fear I may be too late...
383 : This fortress is lauded as the impregnable point of Windurst's defenses. Goddess forbid, should it happen to be taken, Windurst is unlikely to last more than a month's time.
384 : These windblown sands reak havoc on my throat. I look forward to a cup of my daughter's fine Batallia tea.
385 : Take heed, %. I have seen Beastman-dug battle trenches throughout these plains. Should you be found, your life is forfeit.
386 : There is an ominous feeling in the air... This is no place to linger.
387 : Never have I felt a cold as piercing as this. My teeth chatter and my toes grow numb. We would do well to find a place to warm ourselves.
388 : I wonder if it was not somewhere near here where minister Francmage was dispatched on the Multinational Expedition some 10 years ago.
389 : Never did I imagine the day would come that I would set foot in this accursed place. Has great is our foe's desperation? Do not lower your guard, %.
390 : And so we breach the enemy's inner sanctum. Expect anything, %! And don't die on me!
391 : As the Allied Forces have long maintained, this citadel would be ideally suited to the defense of Jeuno.
392 : A well conceived strategy... A stronghold established under the cover of the nest of these vile crawlers. It is almost surely to be overlooked by the enemy.
393 : Oh, mighty Altana, be the sword in my hand. With you, the swift cannot flee, nor the strong escape. Receive mine enemies, for the mercy of the Goddess embraces even the wicked.
394 : Heh heh heh! Wonder what technique I should try out on these ol' beastmen chumps.
395 : Haha... Who will be the next darling recipient of my spells?
396 : Red blood, blue blood, any colorrr blood. If it bleeds, we can kill it!
397 : What's taking so long? I'm getting all antsy-wantsy! My pets are I are all bad at staying still...
398 : Do not fear. Righteousness will prevail. I shall show you victory!
399 : Promise me one thing. Should anything happen to me... Look after my daughter.
400 : I reckon I'll be earnin' my keep. Won't be doin' nothin' extra, though. Don't be expectin' me to risk my hide without my due an' proper, mm-hmmm.
401 : Bravo really is a dear once you get to know him. It's just that in the heat of battle he... Well, you'll see.
402 : My blade, Kyomon, anticipates much beastman blood. This battle may prove interesting, yet.
403 : Look to me, mortals! And be haunted for the rest of your brief time in this world!
404 : For a split second, you thought you saw Titania turn and shoot you a tiny smile.
405 : The flower atop Babban Ny Mheillea's head appears to be in full bloom!
406 : Ribbit! Ribbit!
407 : You'd better watch your back!
408 : Don't take this personally, but I've got children to feed.
409 : Time to have some fun!
410 : Reckon it's time tuh earn my keep, mm-hmm.
411 : Come now, Bravo! It's high time we taught these beasts what a wyvern is truly capable of!
412 : Hehe, so many willing to be sacrificed!
413 : Hmph. Perhaps I should just burn the eyes of these infidels with my true form.
414 : I fear not death, for the Goddess awaits us with open arms.
415 : It is not yet your time.
416 : Be strong, for the Goddess is with you, always.
417 : Return to the dust whence you came! Randgrith!!!
418 : Saints and heroes...glory and despair... Of these I shall sing unto my dying breath.
419 : When work has ended stay not late. Return to where thy dearest awaits.
420 : O gentle Goddess of the Dawn, thou brighten the black of night. Hear our song and heed our call, and bathe us in your delight.
421 : Press forward valiant soldiers, glory draws nearer still. Thy deeds shall resound forever, by my stirring song fulfilled.
422 : Loyal children of Altana, arise and be sustained. Be nourished in thine undying faith, and bask in victory's refrain.
423 : Sing! Dance! Laugh, and cry! Let sweat rain down in floods! Ride upon this rhythmic beat, make seethe thy red life blood!
424 : Dance thine elegant, airy steps that has won a thousand hearts. Enchant, enthrall, and captivate, treat none with disregard.
425 : Honored am I to have this chance to share the same stage with you.

7228 : No...no more... I gotta sit down...
7229 : Hold on... I need to get my strength back...
7230 : I'm at my limit. Please let me recover my strength.
7231 : I can't...go on. You have to let me rest...
7232 : Ugh... If you hadn't noticed, I seriously need rest.
7233 : I fear the next battle may be my last. I beseech you, please permit me to rest.
7234 : Enough! Let me rest already!
7235 : Whoa... I think I'm gonna fall over...
7236 : Please... I need to sit down...
7237 : Can't...fight...any...longer... Must...rest...
7238 : I'm at my limit. Please let me recover my strength.
7239 : The enemy isn't going anywhere. Withdraw and regroup!

7259 : My magic? It might be time to rest soon.
7260 : My magical reserves? Depleted to about the halfway mark.
7261 : I have around half of my magic left.
7262 : My magic is good for a while yet.
7263 : My magical reserves should suffice for now, but we best avoid taking unnecessary risks.
7264 : Are you relying on my magic? If so, we may need to rest soon.
7265 : I still have lots of magic left! Well, maybe half...
7266 : My magic? It might be time to keep an eye on my reserves.

7291 : I've just leveled up, but with your help, it'll take no time at all to get to the next level!
7292 : Hey, I just leveled up, didn't I? Easy on the expectations there, partner.
7293 : Since I have just gained a level, it will be quite some time until I reach the next. Sorry to disappoint you, [sir/milady].

7298 : I have recently risen in level. The next level is still quite some distance away.

7305 : There is still much work to be done. I must gain more experience if I am to become stronger.
7306 : I still have to gain lots more experience, but I'll do my best!
7307 : My next level is still ages away. Why hurry? Don't worry, be happy!
7308 : I have made some progress, but the next level still eludes me.

7311 : I still have much to do. I must gain more experience in order to grow stronger.

7317 : I've gained a fair amount of experience. I must be close to halfway to my next level by now.
7318 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. Can't slow down now!
7319 : Hmm. I must be almost halfway to my next level by now.
7320 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
7321 : I think I'm about half way there...
7322 : I'm half way there, so let's keep up the pace!
7323 : Through sustained effort and your invaluable assistance, I believe I now stand at the halfway point.
7324 : I do believe I'm coming up on halfway to my next level. That was much faster than I expected.
7325 : I think I must be almost halfway to my next level. No time to be slacking off!
7326 : I've come a long way towards my next level. Must be close to halfway by now.

7328 : I believe I've almost reached the halfway point to my next level. Let's not rest on our laurels, however!
7329 : I still haven't acquired enough experience. About double what I have now should be sufficient for the next level.

7336 : I'm slowly getting closer to the next level.
7337 : I reckon I'm fairly close to the next level.
7338 : My next level is now visible on the horizon.
7339 : Just a little more. My next level is not too far away.
7340 : Come on! I need to gain a little more experience for my next level!
7341 : I'm past the halfway point. Not long now until I gain another level.
7342 : Just a little more! My next level is almost within sight!
7343 : Well, well. It appears my next level is not far off at all.
7344 : My next level draws ever nearer. But that doesn't mean you can slack off.

7347 : Hmm. I should be gaining a level soon.
7348 : I'm almost there! I can almost taste my next level!
7349 : Not long now. My next level is just around the corner.
7350 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7351 : I think I'll level up any time now! Yay!
7352 : Ooh, the next level's close...really close. We should prepare to celebrate!
7353 : Why, I would not be surprised if my level were to rise...now! Er...perhaps not quite yet.
7354 : Well, what do you know? I think I'll be gaining a level soon.
7355 : Woohoo! I'll be leveling up really soon!
7356 : This is encouraging. I should be gaining a level any time now.
7357 : I love this time! I'm on the final stretch towards my next level!
7358 : Any time now. My next level is very close, indeed.
7359 : My next level is within reaching distance! From now it's a charge to the finish line!
7360 : <Sniff, sniff> I think I can smell my next level! Come out, come out, whereverrr you are!
7361 : I tell you what. Changing your weapon is fun. Seriously.
7362 : It's always nice to come outside and move around! Those Mog Houses can get so stuffy! Wanna race?
7363 : ... We should keep the chat down. The sound could give our position away to some beastman...
7364 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7365 : Wh-what? Y...you say you want to have a conversation? Um, here goes... Er...nice weather, isn't it...?
7366 : You know, we've been adventuring together for a while now, but we still have lots to learn about each other.
7367 : You called? How may I be of service? You need but ask, and it shall be done!
7368 : I love to chat. But we should keep an eye out for wandering monsters. Just in case.
7369 : Treasure? I'm not really interested. You go ahead and keep it all.
7370 : I just realized something. I've never once had Signet cast on me. Oh well, never mind...
7371 : Communication is really important. We should always let each other know what we're thinking, right? No secrets!
7372 : It's all very well and good to be heroic. But it's best not to overstretch yourself during battle. Overcautious? Perhaps.
7373 : There is a time and place for idle chatter. No, I stand corrected: There is no time nor place for idle chatter.
7374 : She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. The grrreatest Mithra in the world--that's me!
7375 : Fight or evade? I'll leave those decisions up to you. Either is fine with me.
7376 : Battle strategy! We should work together, you know. I know some great weapon skills!
7377 : No need to worry. I've had training in all sorts of weapons. Try me.
7378 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7379 : ...... S-sorry, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I'm not very good at conversation and stuff...
7380 : Seems to me all we do is fight, fight, and fight. Next time we should do something different--something fun!
7381 : While your battle prowess is beyond criticism, the ability to gracefully wield knife and fork at the dining table must not be underestimated. Might I be so bold as to suggest spending more time mastering table manners?
7382 : It's surprising. There's so much beauty to be found outside the city walls. I spend too much time in clothes stores.
7383 : Listen. Let me know if you want me to take the heat. I can take it!
7384 : I like the outdoors. Away from the hustle and bustle of the towns. So relaxing...
7385 : Hey! It's really a lot of fun adventuring with you. We get to see all kinds of things!
7386 : Look at the time. We could spend all day chatting like this. Not that we have to be fighting...
7387 : If I wanted to engage in petty conversation, I'd ask for it!
7388 : Heal the worrrld. Make it a better place. For you and for me, and the entire Mithran rrrace.
7389 : Is that a yawn? Be careful to get enough sleep. It could affect your performance in battle.
7390 : You know me! I can take the hits. Just bring it on!
7391 : ... Sometimes... I just like to be quiet...
7392 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7393 : Um... I've been meaning to ask, I mean... I hope you don't mind me asking, but...uh... Nevermind... <Sigh>
7394 : You know, it's kind of embarrassing we have exactly the same pearl, don't you think?
7395 : Nothing grants me greater happiness than being able to stand at your side, come what may.
7396 : By the way. You don't have to handle everything yourself. I can take the frontline sometimes, too.
7397 : Ah, this is fun! I love visiting different places. Don't you?
7398 : By the way. I'll be there for you, no matter what. Even if your opponent seems too weak to be worthwhile.
7399 : You never know when something bad is going to happen. What's that over there!? Kidding!
7400 : A small reminder: We should be extra careful out here. You never know when an enemy may be near...
7401 : Your curiosity and persistence will take you a long way. But it can be irritating, so don't overdo it.
7402 : Huh...? What is this place? Why am I here? I was supposed to be--ow! My head hurrrts...

7447 : I'd say we've blasted through around # [enemy/enemies] by now!

7450 : You want to know how many enemies we've beaten so far? Let me check... It's #.
7451 : The last one we took care of makes number #, right? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.
7452 : Our progress, [sir/milady]? The last foe bested brings today's tally to # [enemy/enemies].
7453 : We've defeated about # [enemy/enemies] now. That should quieten things down around here!
7454 : I would say we've taken out around # [enemy/enemies] by now. Still more work to be done!
7455 : The last enemy we defeated was number #. As far as I remember.
7456 : How many enemies have we downed? Umm...around #. I think.
7457 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? The last villain we defeated brings us to number #.
7458 : Our tally stands at a meager # enemies. This is unacceptable. We're picking up the pace!
7459 : We've beaten a lot more than three now...prrrobably.
7460 : Defeated enemies? That was number #, I believe.

7467 : We just beat enemy number #. They just keep coming, don't they?
7468 : The last enemy we took down was number #...I think.
7469 : That last enemy brings us to a total of # [enemy/enemies] defeated. We've been busy.
7470 : Umm, let's see here... We've beaten # [enemy/enemies] today, right? I've totally lost count...
7471 : You wish to know the tally of defeated enemies? I believe our total comes to #.

7579 : Hey there, kid, I'm Naiko-Paneiko, up-and-coming ace journalist. Journeying to the remotest frontlines of battle to cover all the news that's fit to printaru!
7580 : I'll travel all over Vana'diel if I have to! To tell people the truth! The real truth about this war that the wartime papers aren't printing!
7581 : ...Oh, what's this? You've got a slight air of journalism about you, kid. Whaddaya say? Wanna help a Taru out?
7582 : There's just two things a good journalist has gotta have, kid! Impeccable verbiage, and a nose for the truth! And, well...and feet, I suppose...to go story-hunting... Three things!
7583 : And I sense all of those things in you. Especially the feet! You're practically overflowing with journalistic vibes, kid! A natural-born newshound! And I'm not only saying that because I'm tragically shorthanded, either.
7584 : In fact, it so happens that I just received a hotaru lead! I was eavesdropping on some sol--I mean... I overheard some soldiers talking the other day. Yeah, that's it!
7585 : Rumor has it that a peculiar oddity of a monster has appeared in the Rolanberry Fields.
7586 : Supposedly some soldiers have been dispatched to take care of it. So go track them down and find out exactly whataru is going on, kid!
7587 : Here ya go. Use this to reportaru back as soon as you hear something.
7588 : Naiko-Paneiko gives you a %!
7589 : You even know how to use a linkpearl, kid? Tell ya what, I'll wait a while and then give you a call.
7590 : Woohoo, this is what we live for, kid! Can't ya feel it!? Now get a move on! There's no time to lose! A cold story is no story at all!
7591 : What are you doing, kid? Get to the Rolanberry Fields rightaru away! There won't be any news left if you don't step on it!
7592 : If you're not turned on to the news, the news will turn on you! Now get with the program, kid!
7593 : Oh, there you are, kid. Greataru work! That was some top-rate info you delivered. I knew I was right about you!
7594 : We gotta put this in printaru and get it in the paper-wapers, double-time! It's sure to get rave reviews from our readers!
7595 : Here ya go, kid. A little token of appreciation from one journalistaru to another. A good newshound's gotta know where they're going before they can track down the stories. Put it to good use.
7596 : Naiko-Paneiko gives you %!
7597 : Here ya go, kid. Put it to good use.
7598 : Oooh, look who's back! We got problems, kid?
7599 : This just doesn't make any sense! Nothing but columns based on solid factaru, and I'm receiving complaint after complaint from readers saying that they're all fabrications and falsehoods!
7600 : I just don'taru get it. These articles are all based on the finest intelligence gathering. But we can't even sell an issue! And just look at these losses! Get out there and get me some more stories!
7601 : Rewrite! From the beginning! Go back and get your facts straightaru! Move it!
7602 : Alll rightaru! Let's make the news!
7603 : I might justaru send you off on another story-hunt, kid. Be ready-weady! A good journalist always is!
7604 : As you can probably tell from all the barrels and spigot-wigots, this complex was originally fitted outaru as a brewery. The Federation Forces have taken it over for military purposes.
7605 : Yes. Military purposes. The enormous-wormous quantity of wine here has nothing to do with its strategic-wegic significance.
7606 : Hey hey hey! How did you get in here!? Were you looking for the brewery?
7607 : We don'taru just make wine here, you know. We also ripen-wipen the rolanberries with the help of crawler saliva. Watch out for the spit puddles...
7608 : All clea-- W-w-wait, who in great piddly-puddles of crawler's spit are you!? You better clear off so I can give the all-clear!
7609 : Hold it, intruder! You could be a Quadav sabotuer! If you had squinty-winty little eyes...and a shell...and a head like a turtle...
7610 : It's obvious to me those beastmen are maneuvering for a shot at Jeuno. We can't be too careful about who we have winder-wandering around this base.
7611 : <Sigh>... Ever since the Federation Forces took over the storerooms for their operations, my business has become a literal casualty of war.
7612 : And the fields are being trompy-stomped flat during the battles with the turtlemen. What's an honestaru merchant to do?
7613 : Yummy-yummy-yummy, I got berries in my tummy!
7614 : Look at that color! Smell that berry goodness!
7615 : Are you sure you wouldn'taru like a taste?
7616 : There is nothing out of the ordinary here.
7617 : You can hear a strange voice... Items, items, la la la la la
7618 : Oh my Gob! You're one of those adventurerurers, aren't ya? You got nothin' on me, [man./lady.] I was just mindin' my own businesesess, lookin' for junk an' stuff.
7619 : Hey, watch out. You don't wanna fight me. I'll turn you into meat jerky! Wait, how about you and me be friends instead? Sound good?
7620 : I travel all over the world and hear lots of differererent stories. I even hear your stories. I can tell you one, if you want.
7621 : Now, listen close...
7622 : Oh... Well, if that's the case, I'm outta here.
7623 : The Goblin slipped away when you were not looking...
7624 : You can hear a strange, raspy voice...
7625 : I travel......hear lots... Hear...stories... Can tell...if...
7626 : .........listen......
7627 : Oh...... ...outta here.........
7628 : Do you want to hear a story? No, thank you. Let's hear one.
7629 : What story would you like to be told? On second thought, maybe later. Green recommendation letter. A Little Knowledge(pt.1). A Little Knowledge(pt.2). A Little Knowledge(pt.3). A Little Knowledge(pt.4). The Weekly Adventurer(pt.1). The Weekly Adventurer(pt.2). The Weekly Adventurer(pt.3). The Weekly Adventurer(pt.4).
7633 : Hey! Hey! Who let you in here? Nobody's supposed to know about the Federation's secret base--nobody meaning you, not me, you see?
7634 : Oh! An adventurer! Why didn't you say so? An adventurer! One who adventures! One who seeks adventure! Well, adventurer, is it adventure that you seek?
7635 : Is it? Show me the way! I've enough adventure, thank you.
7636 : An adventurer with enough adventure!? Where is the adventure in that!? And you call yourself an adventurer!
7637 : Well, looky here! Couldn't say no to adventure, could you? That's why you're here, right? Right?
7638 : I knew it! From the moment you said you were an adventurer, I could sense something...adventurous about you, my friend. And what could be more adventurous than joining an organization called the Cobras?
7639 : Wait right here. I have something for you.
7640 : Alright, show this to Lieutenant Miah Riyuh in Windurst.
7641 : What is it? Why, a recommendation letter from yours truly! How else would you get into the Cobras?
7642 : Come on, take it. Don't be shy.
7643 : There you go. And now all you have left to do is sneak past all the beastmen guarding the path to the Federation capital. Quite adventuresome, I would say.
7644 : Good luck, and may the wisdom of the stars light your path!
7645 : Don't forget to show that % to Cobra Lieutenant Miah Riyuh in Windurst.
7646 : A seasoned adventurer like yourself should have no problem passing the initiation!
7647 : So, you're one of us now! Ah, victory is nigh! The Shadow Lord trembles on his throne as we speak!
7648 : And if I keep telling myself that, someday it will come true, no?
7649 : Well, tickle my belly. I don't get too many customers all the way out here in this day and age.
7650 : Name's Tucker. I'm a trader out of Jeuno. I specialize in providing goods and services for those scholar types.
7651 : Hm? Scholars? You know, they use them grim-wahs and study marital...er, martial theory...or some such.
7652 : Anyway, they're a weird bunch. The most famous one I've heard of is a Bastokan army officer, and he's holed up in a tomb in Batallia Downs somewhere. Crazy, I tell you.
7653 : So, you're %, right?
7654 : Hehe, and that's not all I know. A little bird tells me you need %.
7655 : Well, okay, it wasn't a little bird. It was Professor Ulbrecht, the loony in the tomb. He said I'd be getting a visit from a [lady/guy] called %.
7656 : And shave my moustache if he wasn't right. Anyway, I might be able to help you with your little task.
7657 : Of course, it ain't gonna be for free.
7658 : Here's the deal. I give you one % for every twelve % you bring me.
7659 : I'll take up to four dozen at a time. That means four % for you.
7660 : With the way those scholars go through 'em, % are a gold mine for traders right now. I'm letting them go for cheap, if you ask me.
7661 : I'll be right here when you're ready to trade the goods.
7662 : You brought the %? Fair enough. Here's my side of the bargain.
7663 : Thank you berry much! Ahaha...
7664 : Uh-oh... Looks like I've run out of vellum. But thanks to you, I've built a handsome stockpile of %.
7665 : I don't know how you manage to get a hold of so many, and I'm not gonna ask. No, keep your trap shut. I don't wanna know.
7666 : Be safe on your travels. And say hello to that nutty professor for me!
7667 : This should give a nice boost to my profits. Lemme let you in on a trader's secret as a little bonus.
7668 : Crawler saliva has a preserving effect, you see. The % that have been down here for years sell for ridiculous prices.
7669 : That's why there's always been a market for 'em here in the nest.
7670 : I came to buy % on the way back from business with a customer, but the fields had been ripped up by a scuffle between Federation forces and the turtle guys. The shipments were canceled...
7671 : I was in a real pickle until you showed up. And now I have pickled %!
7672 : I'm still taking % if you've got 'em. Just keep rolling those beauties into my arms!
7673 : Fruits have an off-season, you know. What do you expect me to do with these? Eat 'em myself?
7674 : Go play at trading somewhere else.
7675 : DEBUG: Press a button to continue.
7677 : Wheheheheheheh...
7678 : Wheheheh... Cavern's filled with lots of tasty eats for my babies.
7679 : Whahahahah! He's a plump one, eh? Had 'is fill bitin' the ankles of all the pretty soldiers now, did he?
7680 : The chigoe jumps into Choh Moui's satchel.
7681 : Oooh! With these I can make me and my babies some tasty fixins, ya!
7682 : Wha-wha? Moui don't know nothing 'bout no pet food. Why this smell like my breakfast?
7683 : You find a chigoe with a crimson mark on its back.
7684 : A chunk of rotting crawler flesh lies festering on the ground.
7685 : Hello! Any packages to sendy-wend?
7686 : Greetings. I am Rodeupansat, a friar from the San d'Orian Cathedral.
7687 : As a servant of the Goddess, my duty is to purify the evil that torments our fair land. I have devoted myself to the strengthening of seals that ward off the ever-growing presence of evil.
7688 : Currently, I am working on a seal that will cleanse Vunkerl Inlet of a foul creature of darkness that has been menacing there of late.
7689 : It is imperative that these vile beings, known in the Near East as djinn, are banished once and for all.
7690 : I must hurry and complete the seal lest evil overwhelm the land...
7691 : You are a soldier of the Allied Forces, are you not? Please lend me your ears and listen to my plea.
7692 : If you happen to travel to Vunkerl Inlet, could you please take this % with you?
7693 : I am informed that the presence of evil is most prominent in the southwest region of Vunkerl Inlet. The seal's effect will be greatest if it is attached to the tower that stands there.
7694 : May the Goddess guide you.
7695 : You have attached the % to the tower? You have my gratitude! Did the seal produce the desired effect?
7696 : Is that so... What could possibly have gone wrong?
7697 : This is most discouraging... I created the seal based on the legendary artifact that was said to have warded off evil in the Gusgen Mines in days of yore.
7698 : But I shan't give up! I shall not rest until I have created a powerful seal that will keep the children of Altana safe from harm.
7699 : Please accept this small token of my gratitude.
7700 : Let us work together for the sake of all that is good in this world. May Paradise open its gates to you.
7701 : Ahhh, so you're military tactician who who drew up the plans for this latest supply mission. Why don't we ask one of the men how its going, shall we?
7702 : You are the tactician responsible for our latest operation? Then I shall report in on the status of our mission up until now.
7703 : As per orders, the supply caravan completed preparation of our cargo last night, and set out on the designated route at daybreak.
7704 : Unfortunately, we encountered an accident and lost a portion of our cargo.
7705 : Most regrettably, we encountered an accident and lost out entire load of cargo.

7710 : By the good graces of the Goddess, our convoy was able to emerge victorious over our adversaries.
7711 : By the good graces of the Goddess, our convoy was able to obliterate the beastman supply contingent. In addition, we seized a significant portion of the enemy's supplies.
7712 : However, despite our best efforts, our convoy was utterly defeated. All of our cargo was lost to the enemy horde.
7713 : By the good graces of the Goddess, we narrowly succeeded in throwing the beastmen ranks into chaos and disarray.
7714 : By the good graces of the Goddess, we somehow staved off the beastman attack and shook free. However, we were forced to abandon a portion of our cargo in the process.
7715 : However, we were unable to repel the beastman's relentless pursuit, and in the end our convoy was scattered. All of our cargo was lost to the enemy horde.
7716 : I am pleased to report that our unit was able to reach this stronghold safely with all of the intended cargo. The success of our mission was due in no small part to your brilliant planning.
7717 : Our unit was able to reach this stronghold safely with the cargo. Your planning may well have been the decisive factor in the success of our mission.
7718 : Our unit was able to reach this stronghold, though we did so bearing a great deal less than the intended cargo.
7719 : Supplies abandoned by the Beastmen can be seen be strewn about. However, there is nothing that could be put to any use.

7734 : Our foe advances...may thine aim be true!

7750 : What's this? 'Twould appear that thy weapon can endure no further enchantments.
7751 : Though it may fall short of thy expectations, pray accept it.
7752 : Otherwise, we shall have no choice but to dispose of it.

7830 : Read up on what? Nothing for now. Voidwatch Ops. How to participate. %. Stratum abyssite. Alignment. Atmacite. Periapt.
7831 : The Voidwatch is a fellowship of men and women come together to defend the world from extradimensional invaders called Voidwalkers. Driven only by an insatiable appetite for destruction, these fell horrors roam the space between dimensions, ever seeking to enter and plunge Vana'diel into chaos.
7832 : Faced with the risk of mass invasion, Voidwatch leaders devised a strategy wherein potential threats are preemptively neutralized. This act was made possible through the discovery of voidstones, magicked objects capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible to be summarily dispatched.
7833 : Such efforts to stem the rise of Voidwalkers, collectively dubbed Voidwatch Operations, or Ops for short, take place in the vicinity of planar rifts--weak points in the fabric of space.
7834 : A single person may initiate a Voidwatch operation, at which time Voidwatcher status will be bestowed upon all qualifying party and alliance members, allowing them to commence battle with the target Voidwalker.
7835 : Voidwatch Ops are subject to a time limit. Exceed this limit and Voidwatcher status will be revoked for all involved, bringing the confrontation to an end. Individuals straying too far from the site of battle, too, will find themselves relieved of the status.
7836 : Know also that those who take on the burden of the Voidwatcher become temporarily isolated and unable to receive aid from the outside world. Such is the arduous nature of transdimensional encounters.
7837 : Initiating a Voidwatch operation requires a voidstone, as well as a stratum abyssite attuned to a particular planar rift.
7838 : Only one person needs to be in possession of these objects for all party and alliance members to participate.
7839 : However, there exists a number of participation conditions that must be observed.
7840 : When an operation commences, a single voidstone will be expended for all who possess it. These combatants will have the opportunity to improve their spoils by manipulating spectral alignment values during battle.
7841 : Conversely, those not possessing their own voidstone will be limited in the spoils they can obtain.
7842 : The voidstone is a magicked object which, when coupled with stratum abyssite, is capable of rendering Voidwalkers visible.
7843 : Only a single combatant need possess a voidstone to allow all party and alliance members to participate in a Voidwatch operation. Those without one, however, will find their spoils limited in both quantity and quality.
7844 : As a single voidstone is automatically expended when the battle commences, it is recommended that you keep stock of your inventory.
7845 : Those wishing to obtain the stones should speak to a Voidwatch officer, who is charged with issuing a set quantity at fixed intervals.
7846 : Stratum abyssite are dynamic stones capable of evolution. By absorbing the energies emitted by felled Voidwalkers, they become attuned with other planar rifts.
7847 : After defeating your quarry, present your stone to an atmacite refiner--specialists in the study of otherworld geology--to have its properties determined.
7848 : Stratum abyssite growth occurs independently of voidstones, and the latter is not required to trigger development.
7849 : Each dimension is composed of its own existential spectrum to which objects of that world are aligned. The act of rendering a Voidwalker visible is essentially an act of aligning oneself to its existential spectrum.
7850 : While Voidwatchers are able to, for all practical purposes, interact with such creatures, they in fact fall short of full alignment. Symptoms of this imperfect state can be observed in the limited quantity and quality of spoils normally yielded by Voidwalkers.
7851 : Compensating measures, however, exist which allow combatants to more closely attune themselves with their extradimensional foe. One such method involves the use of alignment-enhancing artifacts known as ascent items.
7852 : Alignment values raised through ascent items will remain in place until such time as a riftworn pyxis is opened at the end of a successful operation.
7853 : Those participating in Voidwatch Ops are recommended to plan ahead in order to make effective use of ascent items.
7854 : Alignment values can also be raised in the midst of battle by striking at enemy weaknesses, causing their existential attunement to shift to your advantage.
7855 : Blows can be dealt with abilities such as weapon skills and magic spells, and your choice of weakness and the manner in which you strike it will determine which hue of the alignment spectrum is affected.
7856 : The existential spectrum is comprised of five lights (blue, red, yellow, green, and white), each of which influences reward yield.
7857 : The precise workings of each light can be reviewed when examining your current alignment values.
7858 : Upon the successful conclusion of battle, the alignment bonus as granted by ascent items and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses are combined to determine the spoils.
7859 : Be forewarned: Voidwalkers are highly guileful beings and will not suffer the same weakness being struck twice. Combatants must be on constant watch for any changes that may occur during the course of battle.
7860 : Atmacite is the physical agglomeration of a monster's soul, and a vessel for its feral instincts. By infusing atmacite to one's body using %, it is possible to enhance one's battle prowess.
7861 : Be aware, however, that powers granted by atmacite can be tapped only when engaged in a Voidwatch operation.
7862 : Atmacite is resilient and will not be expended in the infusion process.
7863 : Furthermore, infused atmacite will remain in place until voluntarily purged.
7864 : As the configuration of atmacite is not possible during an operation, be sure to see to your battle preparations ahead of time.
7865 : Cruor can be used to enrich atmacite, enhancing its potency. The amount of cruor required for enrichment and the resultant properties vary with atmacite.
7866 : Atmacite can be enriched in stages to a maximum of level #.
7867 : All Voidwatchers are urged to make atmacite enrichment a priority, for they might just mean the difference between life and death.
7868 : Periapt are lucky charms that grant myriad beneficial effects ranging from improved vitality to general upturns in fortune.
7869 : Especially sought after are those bestowing temporary items at the commencement of an operation, granting combatants a distinct advantage against the enemy.
7870 : Although their acquisition can only be described as arduous, the benefits make them well worth the effort.
